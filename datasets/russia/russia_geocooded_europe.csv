In an attempt to take advantage of this change, US Secretary of State James Baker made eight trips to the region in the eight months following the Gulf War. The Madrid Invitation, inviting Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians to an opening conference represents the result of this shuttle diplomacy. The invitation, an outcome of compromises by all sides, details the structure of the Madrid process: 

An opening conference having no power to impose solutions 
Bilateral talks with the Arab states bordering Israel, 
Talks with the Palestinians on 5-year interim self-rule, to be followed by talks on the permanent status 
Multilateral talks on key regional issues, like refugees. 
The following is the complete text of the invitation to the Madrid Peace Conference on October 30, 1991, jointly issued by the U.S. and the Soviet Union: The co-sponsors believe that those negotiations should focus on region-wide issues of water, refugee issues, environment, economic development, and other subjects of mutual interest.",197,third party,20,CON_20,Russia,,CON,Entity,Country/State,RUS,Russian Federation,RUS,,https://www.peaceagreements.org/view/33,https://www.peaceagreements.org/viewmasterdocument/33,POINT (97.7453061 64.6863136),"Россия, Россия"
