748286088,"Rene, Helena Kate","A long march to the countryside and back: The Chinese Cultural Revolution, bureaucracy, and rustication",Contemporary,"My overall research question is what roles did public administration and bureaucracy play in implementing the Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside program of the Chinese Cultural Revolution? Also known as the rustication or sent-down program, it lasted from 1968 to 1980 and transferred 17 million urban Chinese youth to rural villages, state and military farms, and Inner Mongolian grasslands. Its intent was to reeducate sent-downs through the study of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, integration into peasant life or military organization, and tempering through hard physical labor. The research is based primarily on extensive interviews of 44 former sent-downs who subsequently returned to the cities. It frames rustication as part of a longstanding struggle within the CCP between two competing visions for China's economic development: Mao and his supporters' desire to base it on Marxian principles versus those who viewed techno-rational bureaucratic organization as central to growth. The research examines the inception, organization, administrative culture, and operation of the rustication bureaucracy. It concentrates on how urban youth were induced to comply with the program, transported, resettled, integrated into daily life and work at their destinations, and eventually returned to the cities. It also investigates differences in the experiences of male and female sent-downs. Among my main conclusions are that the rustication program was: 1) highly efficient on the sending side, but less so on the receiving end. 2) associated with a substantial change in China's administrative culture in which guanxi (reliance on relationships and corruption to gain favorable discretionary decisions) went from infrequent to standard operating procedure, especially as sent-downs became eligible for return to the cities. 3) harsher on female sent-downs, who were highly vulnerable to sexual violence and predation, and under social and work pressures to marry local residents. and 4) related to the growth of administrative discretion and privilege. I further conclude that whereas the sent-downs were tempered, the effects of reeducation in the countryside were somewhat counterproductive. Ironically, rustication promoted some types of bureaucratic behavior that the Cultural Revolution was intended to destroy.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,American University,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, Public administration, Public policy, Bureaucracy, China, Cultural Revolution, Mao, Zedong, Rustication, Rustication program, Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside",2,Washington D.C.,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
746802863,"Su, Yi-Yuan",Potential development of a Southeast Asia Regional Economic Integration Organization as a strategy for expanding regional cooperation under the global climate change regime,Contemporary,"The countries of Southeast Asia have abundant, cross-boarder natural resources and face common adverse impacts of climate change. However, the collective behavior of the Group 77 during global climate negotiations cannot represent the best interests of Southeast Asian countries. Responding to these regional concerns is one of the major goals of the Asia Regional Economic Integration Organization (REIO) proposal. This dissertation proposes that Southeast Asian countries use an independent organization, called an Asia REIO, to represent their best interest during the climate negotiations. This Asia REIO is a joint implementation measure to mitigate GHG emissions of the developing countries in Southeast Asia. This initial proposal envisions the Asia REIO as a credit generating and supply market with transparent information and effective regulation. When the Asia REIO mature enough, it would be able to upgrade from a REIO format to a joint fulfillment agreement, in which Southeast Asia countries can take physical reduction commitments under the Protocol and perform as an Asia Bubble under the climate change regime. To become a Bubble Party, the Asia REIO should: (1) improve information accuracy on emission inventory by using new and additional financial resources. (2) develop regional policies and measures for an Asia REIO. (3) promote regional flexible mechanisms standards. (4) establish a CDM exchange market for investment and trading. (5) establish a single CDM market' and finally (6) select emission reduction commitments to trigger the group participation in the Asia Bubble. In order to encourage widespread participation in the post-2012 framework, Appendix II discusses the possibility of Taiwan's membership in the proposed Asian Bubble, without violating the current political status quo between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China (PRC).",2009,2009,S.J.D.,United States,American University,NA,NA,"History, Law, Climate Change, International law, Bubble, China, Climate change, Kyoto Protocol, Regional cooperation, Southeast Asia Regional Economic Integration Organization, Taiwan, UNFCCC",2,Washington D.C.,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
304332810,"Chen, Maa-ling","Settlement patterns, subsistence systems and their changes in Kenting National Park during O-luan-pi Phases III and IV",Contemporary,"From the perspective of adaptation, diversification in resource exploitation and subsistence activities is a stable, generalized strategy. In contrast, focusing on a few favorable resources and certain subsistence activities is a relatively unstable specialized strategy. A shift in subsistence from a generalized to a specialized system generally involves certain adaptation mechanisms. Changes in subsistence systems between O-luan-pi Phase III (ca. 3500-3000 B.P.) and O-luan-pi Phase IV (ca. 3000-2000 B.P.) in Kenting National Park on the southern tip of Taiwan are evidenced by a shift from fishing, gathering, hunting and small-scale cultivation to a system more dependent on cultivation. This shift correlates with a change in settlement patterns and an increase in the number of habitation sites with migration of populations to previously unhabitated areas. This increase in food production and associated settlement pattern changes in the coastal area of Kenting National Park presents a interesting question: Why did cultivation exist--even increase--and the subsistence system change from a diverse to a specialized strategy in a coastal area with stable, plentiful marine resources? The main purpose of this study is to develop a better chronology, and establish detailed knowledge, of settlement patterns and subsistence systems in this study period, and to confirm previous studies in this area. By studying subsistence systems through time and the mechanisms involved in their change, the understanding of the processes of adaptation and development of agriculture in a coastal area might be obtained. Environmental changes, population growth, and socio-political factors have been suggested as the main factors influencing the development of increased food production. Because of the difficulty of measuring socio-political factors archaeologically, environmental changes and population variation are the two factors that directed this study to understand the mechanism of a subsistence strategy and the processes of its change. Settlement pattern and dietary system two aspects were approached in this research to achieve the goal. An intensive survey on a regional scale and restricted excavations in selected sites have been carried out to fulfill the requirements of the present study. Data such as: artifacts (especially ceramics), site size, site type, site location, site number, demographic variables, environmental resources, soil samples, and food deposits were collected.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,Arizona State University,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Cultural anthropology, China, Taiwan",7,Tempe,Arizona,33.3881,-111.9319,United States
1680586258,"Cheung, Hiu Yu",Sequence of Power Ritual Controversy over the Zhaomu  Sequence in Imperial Ancestral Rites in Song China (960-1279),Medieval,"This dissertation explores the history of ancestral rituals and the related political controversy in the Song China (960-1279). Considering the pivotal role played by ancestral rites in shaping Chinese identity and consciousness, this study contributes to a better understanding of how ancestral ritual has been politicized in Chinese history as a specific cultural apparatus to manipulate politics through theatrical performance and liturgical discussion. Through a contextual analysis of a variety of Song scholar-officials and their ritual writings, including memorials, private letters, and commentaries on the ritual Classics, this study demonstrates that Song ritual debates over the zhaomu [special characters omitted] sequence—that is, the positioning of ancestral temples and spirit tablets in ancestral temples with preparation for alternation or removal—differentiated scholar-officials into separate factions of revivalists, conventionalists and centrists. From a new perspective of ritual politics, this study reveals the discursiveness of the New Learning ( xinxue [special characters omitted]) community and its profound influence on the Learning of the Way ( Daoxue [special characters omitted]) fellowship of the Southern Song (1127-1279). It examines the evolution of the New Learning fellowship as a dynamic process that involved internal tension and differentiation. Daoxue ritualism was a continuation of this process in partaking in the revivalist approach of ritual that was initiated by the New Learning circle. Nowadays, the proliferation of ritual and Classical studies crystallizes the revitalization of Confucianism and Confucian rituals in China. Taking zhaomu as a point of departure, this project provides a lens through which modern scholars can explore the persistent tension between knowledge and power by rethinking the modernization of ritual and ritual politics in contemporary China.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Arizona State University,History,History,"Asian History, Classical Studies, Ancestral ritual, Filial piety, Meritocracy, Ritual politics, Song ritualism, The zhaomu sequence",7,Tempe,Arizona,33.3881,-111.9319,United States
1277718853,"Chao, Jacqueline",Chen Rong and the Transformation of Nine Dragons,Medieval,"This dissertation is the first detailed and extensive study dedicated to the life and art of the master artist and scholar-official Chen Rong (active 13th century), and offers an expanded analysis of his most famous work, the Nine Dragons scroll (1244). It provides a reconstruction of Chen Rong's biography, character and political career, and discusses his significance and impact in the study of Chinese painting during the late Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279) and beyond, by highlighting the reception and interpretation of the Nine Dragons scroll in the past and in modern times. This is achieved by addressing writings such as eulogies, poems and commentary about Chen Rong by his contemporaries and later biographers, and also analysis of recent works by contemporary Chinese artists that reinterpret Chen Rong's Nine Dragons motif directly. In addition to offering an expanded reading and interpretation of Chen Rong's inscriptions on the Nine Dragons scroll and inscriptions by subsequent viewers of the scroll, this study sheds light on the artistic context, significance, and historical development of dragons and dragon painting in China. This dissertation also offers the first full English transcription and translation of Emperor Qianlong's inscription on the Nine Dragons scroll, and that of his eight officials. Furthermore, this dissertation includes two detailed appendices. one is a detailed appendix of all of Chen Rong's paintings documented to exist today, and the second is a list of paintings attributed to Chen Rong that have been mentioned in historical documents that no longer appear extant. This interdisciplinary study provides insight into the processes that influence how an artist's work is transformed beyond his time to that of legendary status. This clarification of Chen Rong's biography and artistic activity, particularly with respect to his most famous work the Nine Dragons scroll, contributes to modern scholarship by providing an expanded understanding of Chen Rong's life and art, which in turn, adjusts prevailing perceptions of his life and work.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,Arizona State University,Art History,Art History,"Biographies, History, Fine arts, Art history, Chen, Rong, China, Chinese painting, Contemporary Chinese art, Literati painting, Nine Dragons, Song dynasty",7,Tempe,Arizona,33.3881,-111.9319,United States
2230000000,"Greene, Carolyn Ann","Politics and Patronage: A Re-examination of Late Qing Dynasty Porcelain, 1850-1920",Contemporary,"Art historians typically consider Chinese porcelain a decorative art, resulting in scholars spending little time analyzing it as a fine art form. One area that is certainly neglected is porcelain produced during the late 19th and early 20th century during the late Qing dynasty (1644–1911) into the early Republic period (1912–1949). As the Qing dynasty weakened and ultimately fell in 1911, there was a general decline in the quantity of porcelain produced in China. Due to this circumstance, porcelain of this era has not received the detailed analysis, characterization of styles, comprehension of themes, and understanding of patronage evident in other periods of Chinese porcelain production. Ultimately, limited research has been conducted to establish the styles associated with late dynastic porcelain into the early Republic’s establishment. This dissertation utilizes a new perspective that considers the patronage of the Empress Dowager Cixi (1835–1908) as a high point of late dynastic porcelain.  Concrete documentation establishes that motifs were appropriated from Cixi’s painting, suggesting a direct connection between schools of painting and the imagery selected for porcelain during her reign. The porcelain Cixi influenced directly guided the porcelain produced during the Hongxian era (1915–1916), making Cixi’s patronage the key turning point from dynastic porcelain to early Republic porcelain. Utilizing predominately British collections, this study identifies the styles, symbols, and themes associated with porcelain of the 19th and 20th century, elevating late dynastic and early Republic wares to the status of fine art.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Arizona State University,Art History,Art History,"Communication and the arts, Social sciences, Empress Dowager Cixi, Patronage, Porcelain, Qing, Republic, Shikai, Yuan,",7,Tempe,Arizona,33.3881,-111.9319,United States
304790345,"Lynass, Kathryn Rose",Leading British periodicals on East Asia: 1870–1911,Contemporary,"Historians have often dismissed nineteenth-century British elites as racist or imperialist without attempting to understand what they meant by race or empire. This is evident in recent post-colonial and area studies, especially those that focus on gender, class, and culture in the British Empire. By taking into account the British use of “race” and “empire,” late-Victorian and Edwardian assumptions and imperial preoccupations become clearer. Analyzing what was written in leading British periodicals about East Asia from 1870 to 1911 helps reveal a good deal about these assumptions. This dissertation looks at six leading periodicals covering the British political spectrum from right to left for the period, namely Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, The Quarterly Review, The Edinburgh Review, The Fortnightly Review, The Nineteenth Century , and The Westminster Review . Also examined are The Asiatic Quarterly Review, The China Review , and The Japan Weekly Mail . Quantitative and qualitative analysis of hundreds of articles and thousands of references about East Asia, appearing in six leading periodicals published in Britain and three focusing on Asia, demonstrate the remoteness of the “Far East” to the British Empire, and the marginal strategic and commercial importance East Asia held as Britain's global hegemony was challenged throughout the world. Analyzing these periodicals shows how British writings about the crumbling Chinese Empire, the rising Japanese Empire, and the occupation of the Korean peninsula are much too complex to be reduced to mere racism and imperialism. The upheaval in India of the 1850s challenged Victorian thinking about formal empire, while events in East Asia upset Edwardian thinking of informal empire. The Sino-Japanese War, the riots in China that culminated in the uprising of the Boxers, and the decrease of British influence throughout East Asia eventually led some Edwardians to question their previous insistence on others following in their footsteps. Such discernment recognized that it was possible to be modern without being British or Western. Japan found its own path to modernity by adapting European methods to its own traditions. Japan's defeat of Russia in 1905 made that point emphatically. Even before Britain focused its attention on Europe during World War I, China, Japan, and Korea sought modernity increasingly on their own terms.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Arizona State University,NA,NA,"European history, History, British and Irish literature, Mass media, British, China, East Asia, Empire, Japan, Korea, Periodicals, Race",7,Tempe,Arizona,33.3881,-111.9319,United States
1899474437,"Bussio, Jennifer J.",Neither Dust nor Gold: A Comprehensive Study of the Dadao School from 1115-1398,Medieval,"During the twelfth century, three new schools of Daoism were founded in North China: Quanzhen (Complete Perfection), Taiyi (Supreme Unity), and Dadao (Great Way). While Quanzhen has received much scholarly attention, the others have been largely ignored. By focusing on just one school—Dadao—as in depth as possible and within the historical context, I hope to elucidate the flourishing state of Daoism in North China during the twelfth through fourteenth centuries beyond just the activity of the Quanzhen school. To that end, I have amassed sixteen inscriptions and records, as well as reconstructed one inscription previously incomplete, and added them to the eleven inscriptions and records published in the Daojia jinshi lüe and the three pieces of Yuan-dynasty poetry and prose contained in the Nan Song chu Hebei xin Daojiao kao. This has doubled the available source material. Most of these have been previously published individually, but have never been studied in conjunction with the other known Dadao texts. The result is the most comprehensive study of the school in over seventy-five years, in which I also present a new understanding of the school’s founder, how the lineages developed, and the school’s ultimate fate. The portrait of the school which emerges from this dissertation challenges the notion that Dadao was nothing more than a minor variation of the Quanzhen school or is otherwise unworthy of scholarly attention.",2017,2017,Ph.D.,United States,Arizona State University,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Religion, History, Asian Studies, China, Dadao, Daoism, Jin dynasty, Religion, Yuan dynasty",7,Tempe,Arizona,33.3881,-111.9319,United States
2705686827,"Chik, Hin Ming Frankie",Imagined Confucian Legacy: Manufacturing “Chinese” Civilizational Consciousness in Pre-Tang China,Pre-modern,"This dissertation discusses how Confucianism was invented as the basis for cultural identity of East Asia and how the “Confucian” Classics were circulated and translated in and beyond China proper. Penetrating the compelling forces behind four well-known and widely used texts—the Shijing, the Hanshu, the Shuowen jiezi, and the Erya—in relation to the power dynamics and negotiations among their writers and others in their times, this dissertation follows two tracks. The first investigates how the Classics—which were shared heritages in the pre-Han period (<202 B.C.E.)—became Confucian cultural capital, on the one hand, and how Confucius and his followers were described as authoritative transmitters of ancient culture and martyrs on orders from “anti-traditional” emperors (such as the China’s first Emperor, Qin Shihuangdi), on the other hand. These four early texts, therefore, set forth the framework within which later Confucian intellectuals studied the Classics and the ancient knowledge therein, and also understood their relationship with state power. The second track explores these texts’ Sinocentric and pedantic attitude toward the circulation of the Confucian Classics among people and cultural “Others” who lacked training in the archaic language of the Classics. Nowadays, in light of the fact that the Confucian Classics have become required texts in the curriculum of national learning in the People's Republic of China (PRC), this dissertation provides a lens through which one can see more clearly how Confucianism becomes part of nation building, even in the contemporary world.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,Arizona State University,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,NA,7,Tempe,Arizona,33.3881,-111.9319,United States
892727771,"Kim, Sukjoo",Liang Fa's Quanshi liangyan and Its Impact on the Taiping Movement,Contemporary,"Scholars of the Taiping Movement have assumed that Liang Fa's Quanshi liangyan ( Good Words to Admonish the Age, being Nine Miscellaneous Christian Tracts ) greatly influenced Hong Xiuquan, but very little has been written on the role of Liang's work. The main reason is that even though hundreds of copies were distributed in the early nineteenth century, only four survived the destruction which followed the failure of the Taiping Movement. This dissertation therefore explores the extent of the Christian influence of Liang's nine tracts on Hong and the Taiping Movement. This study begins with an introduction to China in the nineteenth century and the early missions of western countries in China. The second chapter focuses on the life and work of Liang. His religious background was in Confucianism and Buddhism, but when he encountered Robert Morrison and William Milne, he identified with Christianity. The third chapter discusses the story of Hong especially examining Hong's acquisition of Liang's Quanshi liangyan and Hong's revelatory dream, both of which serve as motives for the establishment of the Society of God Worshippers and the Taiping Movement. The fourth chapter develops Liang's key ideas from his Quanshi liangyan and compares them with Hong's beliefs, as found in official documents of the Taipings. The fifth chapter describes Hong's beliefs and the actual practices of the Taiping Movement and compares them with Liang's key ideas. Even if Hong and his leaders received the new ideas of Christianity, they compromised their traditional culture. Furthermore, they tried not only to combine Chinese culture with Christianity, but also to believe in Christianity as far as they could understand it. This study finds that even though the Quanshi liangyan may have given the Taiping Movement its religious form and driving force, the theological vision of both Liang and Hong also emerged from their Chinese culture, which energized the Taipings. The Taiping Movement resulted from a deliberate synthesis of Christian ideas and native Chinese practices.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,Baylor University,Religion,Religious Studies,"Religious history, History, China, Christianity, Hong Xiuquan, Liang Fa, Quanshi liangyan, Taiping",1,Waco,Texas,31.5599,-97.1882,United States
4330000072,"Mayfield, Alex R. ","Pentecostal Hong Kong: Mapping Mission in Global Pentecostal Discourse, 1907-1942",Contemporary,"This dissertation utilizes archival research and digital methodologies to examine the birth and development of pentecostal mission in Hong Kong between the years 1907 and 1942. Current attention to Hong Kong has tended to focus on the first few years of pentecostal activity in the colony, the growth of early Chinese leadership, and the ways in which pentecostals were different from their evangelical peers. This study takes a longitudinal approach to the pentecostal movement in the colony by viewing it as a form of transnational discourse uniquely related to the local and regional contexts of Hong Kong and southern China. As such, this study is not interested in simply recovering the story of who went where. Instead, it is focused on tracing the changes of pentecostal mission in Hong Kong and understanding how those changes were entangled with the development of global pentecostal self-perception. The dissertation relies upon a broad survey of over six thousand pentecostal periodicals and the creation of a database that enables a meta-level analysis of trends in pentecostal mission. Particular attention is given to five themes: the spatial relationship between pentecostals and the colony, the structural dimensions of the pentecostal movement, common missionary practices, pentecostal spirituality, and pentecostal approaches to gender. By tracing these five themes, the dissertation shows that pentecostal missionary discourse changed dramatically during the first thirty-five-year period in the colony and that changes in missionary ideas, perception, and practices grew from pentecostals’ dialogue with their local environment, global context, and evangelical heritage. This study of pentecostal mission in Hong Kong is divided into three main time periods. From 1907 to 1913, pentecostal missionaries fit the mold of faith missionaries, arriving in China with no formal system of financial support. These missionaries embraced a Sino-Western leadership model and transformed Hong Kong into a transurban center of global missionary outreach. From 1914 to 1928, however, the unified model broke apart, and pentecostal mission, like the broader pentecostal movement, became denominational. As denominational frameworks took hold, missionaries began emulating larger evangelical missionary organizations as they sought to expand their influence into the “interior” of China. From 1929 to 1942, however, the political unrest on the mainland forced pentecostals back to Hong Kong, where they discovered a bevy of new opportunities for mission. Throughout these organizational and spatial changes, pentecostals in Hong Kong were also adapting to the religious marketplace of Hong Kong, negotiating evangelical conceptions of gender and mission and reformulating their place in the global pentecostal movement.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,Boston University,Theology STH,Religious Studies,"Charismatic, China, Pentecostalism, Transnational history, 1907-1942,",5,Boston,Massachusetts,42.3188,-71.0852,United States
1846106323,"Fredman, Zach Simcha","From allies to occupiers: Living with the U.S. military in wartime China, 1941-1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation investigates the U.S. military presence in World War II-era China, Americans’ first attempt to forge a nominally equal military alliance with a non-Western nation. Drawing on overlooked Chinese and English-language sources from archives in six countries, it recasts how we view that relationship. Other studies attribute the wartime deterioration of Chinese-American relations to the contentious relationship between Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. General Joseph Stilwell, or to conflicting wartime and postwar strategic aims. This study, by contrast, shows how the success and failures of the alliance turned upon the actions of a far larger cast of characters: GIs and Chinese soldiers, ordinary civilians, interpreters, hostel workers, farmers, prostitutes, thieves, bandits, and smugglers. It argues that the power asymmetries between these various actors permeated all levels of Sino-American interaction, undermining the Guomindang government, stoking American feelings of superiority, exacerbating Chinese sensitivities about unequal treatment, and making these allies into adversaries even after Stilwell left China but also long before Cold War animosities solidified. A military occupation, friendly or otherwise, required a daunting set of arrangements that are rarely examined in detail. Beginning in 1941, as some 70,000 U.S. troops trickled into China, American commanders and their Chinese hosts set about solving knotty problems of alliance management related to providing food, lodging, and interpreters. Interactions between GIs and Chinese civilians nevertheless proved fraught, particularly in relation to issues of money, legal privileges, cultural norms, and sex. As theft, misconduct, and violent encounters snowballed, military-to-military relations also deteriorated. From Chinese perspectives, the alliance became an occupation. From American perspectives, the Chinese became impediments—rather than partners. The wartime alliance marked a key turning point in how the United States projected power around the world as well as a seminal moment for modern Chinese perceptions of Americans. After Japan’s surrender, Chinese Communists would exploit local resentment against American servicemen to attack the Chinese Nationalists and seize and consolidate power. Meanwhile, the U.S. military’s legal, cultural, economic, political, and sexual impact on China set recurring patterns of American military behavior that have complicated U.S. policy down to the present day.",2016,2016,Ph.D.,United States,Boston University,History,History,"History, American history, History, China, Military alliance, Occupation, U.S.-China relations, United States, World War II",5,Boston,Massachusetts,42.3188,-71.0852,United States
1500435563,"He, Yanchiuan","The materiality, style, and culture of calligraphy in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127)",Medieval,"The cultural accomplishments of the Northern Song dynasty are unrivalled in Chinese history. Song literati were particularly enthusiastic about calligraphy and writing materials, and the scale of their engagement in the art of writing exceeded that of both former and later dynasties, leaving plentiful legacies of calligraphic culture for later generations to study and appreciate. However, most modern studies emphasize the transmission of calligraphic culture from the Tang to Song and neglect the dynamics of disconnection and transformation between these two dynasties. By demonstrating how the technologies of brush, paper, ink cake, ink stone, and chair and desk (the materiality of calligraphy) shaped the look of calligraphy, this dissertation proposes an alternative understanding of the nature of Song innovations in the art of writing. Insofar as these innovations reconfigured the subsequent history of Sinitic calligraphy (calligraphic traditions based on Chinese characters), this dissertation argues that we cannot understand the art of writing without exploring the technology of writing. Through this study, I present the processes by which the literati of Northern Song traced, received, and modified the calligraphic culture of the past in creating their own Northern Song culture. Because of cultural discontinuity and transformation, what they ultimately reconstructed served as the foundation for their own culture, and has become the basis for how we think of the pre-Song past.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,Boston University,"Art and Architecture, History of GRS",Art and Architecture,"History, Art history, Calligraphic style, China, Chinese calligraphy, Literari culture, Northern song, Writing materials",5,Boston,Massachusetts,42.3188,-71.0852,United States
304691045,"Li, Dan",Three essays on the economic history of modern China,Contemporary,"This dissertation comprises three chapters on the economic history of Modern China. The first chapter investigates the effects of civil wars on railroad development in pre-communist China. Chapters Two and Three (joint work with Chun-Yu Ho) explore the pattern of the unequal regional development in contemporaneous China. In Chapter One, I analyze the economic effects of civil wars on the Chinese railroad industry development in later Qing Dynasty and so-called “Warlord Period” (1906-1923), during which China suffered from numerous violent internal conflicts, or “civil wars”. I construct a new panel data set linking archival data for railroads to detailed information on civil wars. I show that conflicts had negative effects on business transportation flows, operating revenue, and investment. These effects occurred during the same period as the conflict, but also persisted after the fighting had stopped. My findings suggest that, in the absence of internal strife, China would have experienced more rapid growth during a crucial phase of its modern economic history. Chapter Two analyzes the time series property of the various Chinese regional inequality measures from 1952 to 2000 by employing unit root techniques. We find that the inequality measures are trend stationary with structural breaks rather than following a random walk. moreover, the break points coincide with key events in the contemporary Chinese history (e.g. the Cultural Revolution and economic reforms). Our results imply that some policies have been influential enough to alter the trend of the evolution of regional inequality. In Chapter Three, we analyze the evolution of urban output per capita across Chinese large cities in the post-reform era. Our results suggest no evidence of convergence across these cities from 1984 to 2003. However, we find that cities with comparable output per capita are likely to be located in the same region. further, cities tend to mirror the mobility of their counterparts located in the same province, but not the same region. The divergence in urban output per capita across the nation will continue if the current economic growth pattern persists in the future.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Boston University,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, China, Civil war, Civil wars, Economic history, Qing dynasty, Railroad, Railroad industry, Warlord",5,Boston,Massachusetts,42.3188,-71.0852,United States
304898137,"Li, Mingjiang",Turbulent years: Mao's China and Sino -Soviet split,Contemporary,"The Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s was an earthquake in Cold War international politics. This study, taking advantage of newly available materials, explores the sources of the rupture from a fresh perspective. The central argument is that the Beijing-Moscow fissure and confrontations were closely related to Mao's intention of using Sino-Soviet ideological differences for his domestic political purposes, including pushing for his radical domestic agenda, steering China towards an ideological path of his own visions, and striking down political power challenges. In the first half of 1958, Mao tried hard to diminish Soviet influence in China in order to launch the Great Leap Forward program, which contributed to the emergence of disputes with the Soviets, apparently on the Soviet proposals of military cooperation. The catastrophic failure of the Great Leap produced significant political challenges in the CCP leadership against Mao. Khrushchev and his cohorts also openly disagreed with and criticized Mao's domestic radicalism. An enraged Mao declared a political war against his opponents at home and abroad, which drastically shook the foundation of Sino-Soviet alliance in 1959 and 1960. The retreat policies adopted by other leaders in the aftermath of the disastrous Great Leap were soon accused by Mao as ill-designed moves to lead China to a revisionist road as Khrushchev had done in his country. Starting from the end of 1962, Mao began to initiate massive political campaigns to prevent revisionism from happening in China. Opposing the Soviet revisionism became an integral part of Mao's grand scheme of exterminating sources of revisionism in China. During the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese media systematically demonized the Soviet leadership and Sino-Soviet relations reached open hostility and even military confrontations.

304586414,"Young, Matthew Scott","When your enemy hungers: The Kennedy administration, public opinion, and the famine in China, 1961–1962",Contemporary,"In late 1960, as President-elect John F. Kennedy prepared to take office, the People's Republic of China suffered in the throes of a terrible famine which resulted from the failed Great Leap Forward campaign. Although the exact scope of this disaster (which claimed some thirty million lives) is still not entirely known, media and intelligence sources began to disseminate news of widespread suffering on the mainland through a variety of channels in early 1961. This study attempts to analyze the ways that the American public and policymakers responded to the crisis. Given the considerable obstacles involved in assessing the scope of the famine, the American media conveyed an accurate sense of the suffering on the mainland. Based on editorials in major newspapers and magazine, polls, and the efforts of various national and grassroots organizations, the public responded willingly to an overture of American food for the Chinese people. Judging from the reaction the famine received in scholarly journals, China experts were more skeptical regarding its significance. Through the fortuitous acquisition of a series of secret Chinese documents, the Kennedy administration had a much better picture of the crisis on the mainland than did the general public or China experts. More fearful of a Congressional (rather than public) backlash, the Kennedy administration remained open to an overture, and made delicate attempts to probe Chinese willingness to accept American food. These attempts were later publicly rebuffed by the Chinese. the outbreak of hostilities with India in October 1962 ended administration interest in moderation toward Beijing. In contrast to earlier scholarship, this study reveals that the administration took the crisis seriously and made several careful attempts to extend a moderate overture to Beijing. Policymakers did not fear a negative public reaction from such a move. instead, they believed a food overture would find support in a tradition of American humanitarianism. Still, a number of other factors made the administration understandably cautious. An unequivocal rejection from Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi in May 1962 finally shelved the question of food for China.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Bowling Green State University,NA,NA,"American history, History, International law, International relations, China, Famine, Kennedy administration, Public opinion",2,Bowling Green,Kentucky,36.9716,-86.4378,United States

While Congress debates every year whether to extend the MFN status to China, it was the United States which in 1844 eagerly sought the same privilege from China. The much heralded Open Door policy was a diplomatic arm of the U.S. trade policy, designed to insure the American citizens in China that none of their foreign commercial competitors had unfair commercial advantages. Historically and today, the United States has entertained a great optimism regarding the potentiality of the China market as the place to export America's industrial products. The analysis of trade data, however, has conclusively proved that such an optimism is unwarranted. The China market was, and is still today, more important as an import, rather than an export, market. In the past and present, the United States has recorded persistent, and ever-increasing, trade deficit, a core of the current Congressional debate. Nevertheless, while tariff occupies the heart of the MFN status, its actual impact upon the trade volume, historically, has been negligible. What impacted on the rise and fall of the Sino-American trade volume has been the domestic economic conditions of the two countries and factors external to them, e.g., wars, invasions, and Great Depression. Moreover, the China trade has occupied a rather insignificant place in the worldwide trade of the United States. In the past it represented a mere 2% of the U.S. overall trade. Even after substantial increase in the trade volume in the recent years, the share of the China trade still stands at approximately 6% of the U.S. overall trade.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,Bowling Green State University,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, Economic history, China, Most-favored nation, Politics, Trade policy",2,Bowling Green,Kentucky,36.9716,-86.4378,United States
2120000000,"She, Gangzheng",The Dragon behind the Curtain: China and the Arab-Israeli Conflict during the Cold War,Contemporary,"This work explores the role which China played in the Arab-Israeli conflict during the Cold War (1948–1992). By investigating Beijing’s changing relations with both the Arabs and the Israelis, the study situates the transformation of China’s involvement in this conflict within the broader context of a “global Cold War”. This dissertation also presents a new interpretation of the relationship between domestic politics and diplomacy in Beijing’s interactions with Israel, the Arabs states, and the Palestinians over more than four decades. After the People’s Republic was proclaimed by Mao Zedong as well as the first war between Israel and the Arab states ended with the signing of armistice agreements, both Communist China and Israel became new actors in the international arena and respectively confronted new strategic, political, and economic realities in the context of an emerging Cold War. Although the Jewish state was the first country in the Middle East to recognize the People’s Republic of China, the attempts from both sides at establishing diplomatic relations were doomed due to the outbreak of the Korean War. Following the 1955 Bandung Conference Beijing achieved breakthroughs in the Arab world, but the relations with the so-called “revolutionary” Arab states were never easy because of the latter’s recurring ruthless crackdowns on Arab communists as well as China’s own zeal for political movements such as the Great Leap Forward. As its split with Moscow seemed irreversible, China became increasingly inclined to support militant groups according to the Maoist idea of aiding national liberation movements across the Third World, attempting both to differentiate from Soviet revisionism abroad and to act in concert with the leftist fever at home. Starting from the mid-1960s, Beijing’s utopian pursuit of world revolution, together with the Sino-Soviet competition for the Third World leadership, helped transform the Arab-Israeli conflict from largely a confrontation between Israel and the Arab states into a national liberation struggle between Israel and the Palestinian people and thereby support for the Palestinians became a consensus for many Third World countries. However, with the Sino-US rapprochement and the ebb of Cultural Revolution, Beijing gradually worked together with Washington to curb Moscow’s expansion of influence in the Middle East and began to embrace a more favorable attitude toward a peace process. During the new era of “Reform and Opening Up”, the change of Beijing’s approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict not only became an integral part of China’s fundamental transformation in its overall diplomacy but also greatly promoted exchanges and understanding between China and the Middle Eastern countries. As the collapse of the Soviet Union marked the end of the Cold War, Israel and China formally established diplomatic relations in early 1992, a milestone in the latter’s diplomatic history since Beijing finally had formal relations with all the countries in the Middle East. At the same time China was also about to become a net importer of petroleum due to its tremendous economic growth, thus its relations with both the Israelis and the Arabs were ready for the beginning of a new chapter. Based on newly declassified archives, extensive memoirs and media reports, and interviews with key actors and witnesses, this dissertation addresses lacunae in the existing literature in particular China’s attempts at perceiving and influencing the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the lack of attention given to how the historical trajectory of Arab-Israeli conflict helped transform the understanding of both decision-makers and ordinary people of China toward the Middle East and the larger international system.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Brandeis University,Near Eastern and Judaic Studies,Near Eastern and Judaic Studies,"Social sciences, Arab-Israeli conflict, China, Cold War, Beijing, Zedong, Mao, Great Leap Forward,",3,Waltham,Massachusetts,42.3889,-71.2423,United States
2050000005,"Linton, Matthew D.","Understanding the Mighty Empire: Chinese Area Studies and the Construction of Liberal Consensus, 1928–1979",Contemporary,"Chinese area studies was formed in the late 1920s by a coalition of foundation officers, academic administrators, internationalists, European scholars, and graduate students. This group believed that China was on the brink of a cultural and political renaissance that would restore it to global prominence. The United States had an opportunity to work with a rising China to create a new world order based in the Pacific Ocean; leaving petty European rivalries behind in the process. The United States was ill-equipped to seize this opportunity, however. American politicians and the public were poorly informed about China. Furthermore, there were few credible public experts to educate Americans about their opportunity in China. This dissertation explores how this coalition created Chinese area studies and how the field navigated the travails of mid-20th century domestic and foreign politics. Chinese area studies was an interdisciplinary method whereby insights from across the humanities and social sciences were integrated to provide a holistic picture of Chinese civilization. This method was born out of a new progressive liberal confidence that collaboration between disciplinary specialists would give special insight into particularly large or thorny problems. Furthermore, the area method allowed administrators like the American Council of Learned Societies’ Mortimer Graves and the Institute of Pacific Relations’ Edward C. Carter to concentrate and maximize scarce resources. Though Chinese area specialists achieved early success through their work in intelligence and training during World War II, their long-term efficacy was beset by political controversy and scholarly infighting. The “loss” of China to communism in 1949 simultaneously made China specialists national security assets and targets for anticommunist critics of Democratic liberalism. McCarthyism painted liberal China specialists as unduly sympathetic to communism; damaging the careers of leading specialists like Owen Lattimore and John Fairbank in the process. Anticommunists specialists fared little better when, after McCarthyism subsided, they were ostracized from the profession for their collaboration with Congressional investigators. Political controversy and professional animosity stunted China studies’ development during the 1950s and the field nearly collapsed. The field was rescued by a new liberal coalition of China specialists and Ford Foundation officers who rebuilt the field around the Joint Committee on Contemporary China (JCCC). The Joint Committee was organized by John Fairbank and provided a space for scholars to air their political grievances in private. Ford used JCCC to infuse millions of dollars into the field; facilitating its expansion during the 1960s and alleviating tensions between competing specialists in the humanities and social sciences. With financial stability came political rehabilitation. China specialists returned to public political advocacy in 1966 by presenting their opinions on contemporary China before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Trouble was looming on the horizon, however. As liberal China specialists sought to increase their influence in Washington by forming an official lobbying organization called the National Committee on US-China Relations, young radical experts were upset by the close ties between their older peers and government officials promulgating an unjust war in Vietnam. They formed their own body, the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars (CCAS), to criticize mainstream Asian studies and question the role of the intellectual in modern society. While mainstream China specialists saw government as a vehicle to turn their ideas into policies, radicals argued that this instrumental view of ideas sacrificed ethics at the altar of political expedience. Mainstream China specialists were able to accomplish much of their political agenda during the 1970s – the resumption of a formal diplomatic relationship with communist China, in particular – but the break between older and younger specialists never fully healed and the field would never again be united as it was during the early 1960s. Intellectual disagreement was compounded by a changing institutional environment. Ford began shrinking its financial commitment to the field in 1968. The Nixon Administration did the same with federal funding in the early 1970s. Universities also started hiring fewer China specialists; making it difficult for young scholars to find employment. In the midst of this crisis, leading programs like Harvard University tried pivoting to a new sponsor: multinational corporations. Fairbank and others reasoned that as corporations expanded into East Asia, they would need to be guided by regional experts. While these partnerships had some early success, disagreement about the purpose of higher education and the utility of expert knowledge for corporations, ultimately led to its demise. Fortunately, the resumption of formal diplomatic relations between the United States and communist China led to new opportunities abroad for American China experts. This diffuse scholarship persists to today, but in a globally integrated academic community, there is little public engagement and there is little that it distinctly American about it.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Brandeis University,History,History,"Social sciences, Area studies, China, Intellectual history, Liberalism, Philanthropy, United States, Carter, Edward C., McCarthyism, Lattimore, Owen, Fairbank, John, Joint Committee on Contemorary Cina, JCCC, Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars, CCAS, Graves, Mortimer, Institute of Pacific Relations, American Council of Learned Societies',",3,Waltham,Massachusetts,42.3889,-71.2423,United States

It asks: Who were the major political players and forces behind policymaking? What were their motives, philosophies, stated objectives, manifested practices, and hidden interests in controlling women's fertility? What were the inducement mechanisms for radical birth control? And what were the results in terms of better lives for the people and improvement in women's status? In response to the questions, this study investigates the genesis of global population control, the influence of foreign and national forces, the role of key political figures, and the dominant discourses, policies and programs relevant to global fertility control. It also analyzes the dynamics and interactions between major political players (identified here as: the state, global capital , and technocrats ) in intruding on women's reproductive function in both nations. As stakeholders, those three parties exercised significant dominance over poor women's reproductive autonomy, while women —the targets of the policies—were completely excluded and silenced. in the process of policy making, implementation, and measurement of the results. Dynamics of the policy implementation in the ROK and the ROC included: (1)&#xa0.the intervention of foreign forces through global capital —characterized as commercialization, disempowerment, oppression, and objectification of women. (2)&#xa0.the roles played by the male elite, specifically technocrats , in exercising significant dominance over women's reproductive autonomy. (3)&#xa0.passivity, silence, and women's internalization of the newly perceived need for birth control. and (4)&#xa0.social marketing through mass media, leading to drastic reductions in family size norms. The findings identify significant policy failures in projecting short-term and long-term plans for reaching the replacement level of fertility rate (2.1) in the ROK and the ROC. Both nations now face the issue of a seriously low fertility rate (1.4 in the ROK and 1.5 in the ROC in the year of 2000) that urgently requires a policy correction. Other side effects of the policies include an unbalanced sex ratio, a lack of blue-collar workers, and a rapidly aging population. The study demonstrates that the political economy of fertility control in both nations during the period from 1961 to 1992 was a manifestation of the intervention of capital from the industrialized West into poor women's reproduction. It also provides a new understanding of the forces behind the birth control movements in South Korea and Taiwan. In essence, global capital 's intervention into poor women's fertility in developing nations, starting in the early 1950s, was an important aspect of the globalization of the labor force and the creation of a new international division of labor on a global scale.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Brandeis University,NA,NA,"Welfare, Public health, Womens studies, History, China, Fertility reduction, Korea, Population control, Taiwan",3,Waltham,Massachusetts,42.3889,-71.2423,United States

The movement in turn inspired a publishing boom that changed the Chinese cultural landscape. This dissertation explores publishing as a nexus of cultural politics, intellectual sociability, cultural economy, and the reading public. It does so through an exploration of the history of Kaiming Press (1926-1953), the most successful publishing house launched by May Fourth intellectuals. Founded by a large network of May Fourth intellectuals initially as an avant-garde press, it grew into the fifth largest publisher in Republican-era China and exerted a profound influence on the generation of middle-school students who constituted the bulk of its readership. This study challenges both the classic interpretation of the May Fourth movement as an enlightenment movement and the revisionist view of it as a hegemonic cultural project. Instead, it establishes how the modernizing market required writers of the era to transform themselves into publishing professionals and their presses into profit-earning ventures. To meet this challenge, my study demonstrates that the May Fourth writers associated with Kaiming Press reached out to a broader readership, which then created an open and interactive cultural space in the post-May Fourth decades. In this new cultural space, intellectuals and their student readers each articulated their collective sentiments and transformed their identities based on the parallel experience of being prophets and vanguards of the Chinese revolution as well as members of a petty-bourgeoisie in decline. Their identity crisis ultimately contributed to creating a social and cultural environment that made communist revolution conceivable and eventually welcomed by many educated people in urban centers. This dissertation also reveals the distinctive May Fourth pattern of intellectual sociability that transcended the dichotomy of tradition and modernity. The social and cultural networks reconfigured during the May Fourth era with help from the modern press, functioned as historical agents of ideological formation and historical change. Ultimately, however, it was the dynamics of traditional literati sociability marked by personal networks that germinated and spread new ideas, initiated modern organizations, and made the May Fourth business of enlightenment possible.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Brown University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Journalism, China, Kaiming Press, Printing, Reading, Republican",9,Providence,Rhode Island,41.823,-71.4187,United States
304832076,"Gu, Yi","Scientizing vision in China: Photography, outdoor sketching, and the reinvention of landscape perception, 1912–1949",Contemporary,"In China's Republican era (1912-1937), there arose a number of novel artistic approaches to the depiction of landscape. While some artists responded to the nation's new global orientation by adopting Western styles, others found within their own history the basis for a redefinition of landscape. These traditional style painters developed an idiosyncratic understanding of perception, acknowledging the optical rules underlying Western perspectival pictures while not entirely accepting them as universally applicable. This dissertation examines how, by anchoring their landscape painting in outdoor sketching, these artists altered the ways painters depicted nature. My aim is to restore to this group their role as agents of change, and to provide an alternative account of modern Chinese art history and culture. The new priority that traditional style painting granted perception is found to resonate with a contemporary emphasis on observation that the New Culture Movement promoted as the basis for modern scientific knowledge. Chapter One traces the development of Chinese designations for photography in the late Qing and early Republican period, and argues that, via conceptualizations of this technology, the credibility of visual representation came to be founded on the notion of a physical encounter between the image-maker and the object of representation. Chapter Two contextualizes the engagement of traditional style painters with outdoor sketching ( xiesheng ) as part of the prioritization of perception in New Culture Movement. Chapter Three discusses the traditional style painters simultaneous appropriation and rejection of formerly alien ideas such as framing and linear perspective, which resulted in a reshaping of optical knowledge as well as the Chinese painting tradition. The final chapter demonstrates the transformation of texture stroke ( cun ), a key component of Chinese landscape painting, from self-referential marks of style to a specialized knowledge necessary for an accurate perception of nature. These activities enabled traditional style painters not only to claim epistemological expertise but also to define a new role for themselves in society.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Brown University,NA,NA,"History, Art history, Art and science, China, Chinese painting, Epistemology, Landscape, Modern Chinese art, Perception, Photography, Sketching",9,Providence,Rhode Island,41.823,-71.4187,United States
305347248,"Rothschild, Norman Harry","Rhetoric, ritual, and support constituencies in the political authority of Wu Zhao, woman emperor of China",Pre-modern,"Unique in China's long history as the sole female emperor, Wu Zhao (r. 690–705), often called Wu Zetian or Empress Wu, deposed her two sons, Zhongzong and Ruizong, established Luoyang as her Divine Capital in place of Chang'an, and changed the dynastic name from Tang to Zhou. To legitimize her sovereignty, she necessarily devised a creative series of persuasive strategies. This dissertation analyzes the construction of Wu Zhao's imperial power and legitimation through examining her manipulation of language, her appropriation of traditional political concepts, her public performance of rituals, and the contributions of different constituencies to her authority. With an aesthetic flair, Wu Zhao deftly manipulated language, creating a series of ornate new characters, frequently changing reign eras, revising bureaucratic titles, and altering place names. Texts like Regulations for Ministers created a culture of loyalty among the bureaucrats in her court. Rhetoricians cast her as a Sage Mother, to whom the common people gravitated as sons. In the cosmopolitan late 7th century, she assembled a diverse array of political supporters, humble and eminent, Chinese and non-Chinese, Buddhist, Daoist and Confucian. With tremendous fanfare and publicity, ceremonies like the sacrosanct feng and shan sacrifices and ritual monuments from Confucian tradition were brought to life. In her capable hands, tradition was a plastic medium: Her rites and monuments were not Confucian, but ideological hybrids. She invested language and ritual with her own character, molding flamboyant carnival and a garish aesthetic into an artistic mandate that centralized power must be revered. Wu Zhao's true ideological affiliation remained opaque. This ideological blankness enabled her to cover more symbolic and ideological space, a vital political skill administering the diverse, multi-ethnic empire.

It seeks to account for the factors that enabled a handful of Europeans—no more than 35 at one time—to scale formidable cultural barriers to create a Chinese Church with more than 200,000 adherents in little more than a century. On the basis of extensive research in little used archival collections in Lisbon and Rome, this study presents a new vision of the Society of Jesus' Vice-Province of China that eschews the traditional themes of its historiography: the well-known “accommodation” policy, the Chinese Rites Controversy, or the science of the Peking Jesuits. Focusing instead on the mission's practical religious dimensions, it reveals Jesuits' motivations, challenges, and strategies when faced with their missionary task. It also describes many of the responses they provoked in their efforts to bring Christianity to those who were disposed to receive it, whether rich or poor, city-dwellers or peasants. This dissertation first provides a new chronological narrative of the Jesuits' Chinese endeavor, presenting the growth of a Mission Church centered on the Jiangnan region, with significant Christian communities spread throughout the Ming, and later Qing Empire. Here, the history of the mission reveals a continually expanding enterprise fatally overextended by the very effectiveness of its missionary methods, and whose vitality was sustained by two groups: the missionaries and their Chinese followers. Following the narrative, a set of four chapters discusses the aspects of missionary formation—from their training in standard Jesuit organizational techniques, to their spiritual and pastoral formation, to their systematic study of Chinese language and philosophy—that enabled these men to provide the first impulse to the spread of “the Law of God.” Another set of four chapters then discusses how the missionaries created and structured their Chinese Church, from the techniques of persuasion they used to claim conversions, to the “parish” system they administered through a set of trained Chinese auxiliaries, to the elaborate forms of contemporary Catholic practice they promoted among their devout Christians.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Brown University,NA,NA,"History, European history, History, Religion, Catholic, China, Jesuit, Missionary, Portugal, Society of Jesus",9,Providence,Rhode Island,41.823,-71.4187,United States

The philosopher Zhang Dongsun was a leader in what has been called “the third force in China,” a group of minority parties and groups that rejected the Guomindang military dictatorship in office and the CCP “people's dictatorship” in contention, and offered a democratic, non-Communist alternative of social and political organization. As a professor, journalist, third-party founder and defiant guardian of democratic aspirations, Zhang described a vision of the nation's possibilities that differed dramatically from those of the two opposing parties in its reliance upon mass participation, democratic institutions, and absolute intellectual freedom. The work of these third-force activists during the Nationalist period of China's history illuminates the existence of an urgent and committed search for solutions to China's grave dilemma apart from the GMD/CCP structure, as it reveals the true source of a democratic movement that has since struggled to establish its place in contemporary Chinese society. Zhang Dongsun's unique and enduring contribution to that endeavor was his presentation of the vast corpus of the Western intellectual tradition as a variety of human thought that could be considered separately from its historical context of domination and cultural destruction.

304683379,"Fang, Cheng-Hua",Power structures and cultural identities in imperial China: Civil and military power from late Tang to early Song dynasties (A.D. 875–1063),Medieval,"This dissertation explores the evolution of civil and military power in China during the Tang and Song dynasties. Shifts in the loci of power between civil and military officials directly contributed to the formation of their distinctive identities. When the civil power reached its apex in the eleventh century, I argue, civil and military officials formed two distinct groups with different cultural identities, political privileges and personnel regulations. At this time, boundary between these two groups ceased to be permeable, in sharp contrast to their fluid identity in the early seventh century. The trend of civil-military segregation started in the mid-seventh century, as military service became increasingly professionalized. The balance of power between civil and military officials in the Tang government, I argue, imposed limits on the widening gap between these two camps. The decline of the central authority after 875, however, suddenly caused an expansion of military power at the expense of the civil elite. Sixty years of military dominance in North China ensued as professional soldiers controlled decision-making and gave their regimes a military orientation. While relegated to symbolic roles in the government, civil officials still struggled to continue civil and bureaucratic traditions by convincing military magnates of the value of Confucianism. After managing the civil administration, some military officials began to realize the necessity of literary learning for effectively governing a state. As military officials were to acculturate Confucian principles and practices after 951, the government's orientation shifted from the military to the civilian side. To recover their power, civil officials actively promoted civil and literary expertise over military interests. Their efforts saw triumph after 1004, as the Song court decided against warfare by appeasing neighboring states with money. Barred from showing their talents in the military arena, military officials dramatically lost influence. To strengthen their own identity and sense of cultural superiority, civil officials stigmatized military men as immoral and ignorant. With this cultural bias, civil officials confronted military officials as potential rivals rather than colleagues. This distrust between civil and military officials remained an unsolved dilemma for the rest of the Song dynasty.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Brown University,NA,NA,"History, Political science, China, Civil, Cultural identities, Imperial, Military, Power, Song dynasty, Tang dynasty",9,Providence,Rhode Island,41.823,-71.4187,United States

In what sense did Mainlander immigrants of 1949 contribute to Taiwan's unique identity in its modernization process? By dissecting a New Confucian's legendary life and thought, this dissertation explores the Chinese heritage that exiles brought to Taiwan after the KMT's exodus from Mainland China. Once a confidant of Chiang Kai-shek with socialist vision, Xu Fuguan (1904-1982) the non-conformist turned into a devout democratic Confucian only after the trauma of 1949. Facing the challenges of American hegemony, lingering Japanese influences and two other Chinese-processed importation, the KMT's Leninist ideology and Hu Shi's liberalism, Xu's crusade for New Confucianism in Taiwan did not succeed. First of all, his cultural conservative colleagues were divided due to conflicting interpretations of Confucianism. He did not win over the Taiwanese public, whose trust in traditional Chinese culture had crumbled after the February 28 Incident of 1947. nor did he convince the iconoclastic liberals of the compatibility between Confucianism and democracy, because the KMT demonstrated more powerfully a dictatorship in the guise of traditionalism. Moreover, his hostility to modern art antagonized the alienated, Americanized literary youth. his confrontation to the Protestant-sponsored Tunghai University eventually forced him to leave Taiwan in 1969. In fact, not just the New Confucian cause blundered, even liberalism failed, too, witnessing the KMT's suppression of the democratic movement in 1960 and the self-destructive aftermath of the Controversy over China and the West throughout the 1960s. Nevertheless, Xu's pugnacious dialogues with his fellow exiles proved that Taiwan under the white terror was not as sterile as the label cultural desert suggested. the seeds they sowed anticipated the growth of pluralism of the island in the 1990s. The revival of many May Fourth contentions during this period familiarized Taiwan with Chinese conservative and liberal legacy of the Republic period, yet other cultural forces outside the exile community still distinguished Taiwan from pre-1949 China, let alone the China after 1949.

I begin the dissertation with an analysis of two peasant uprisings of the 1860s, to explore interactions between local officials and the local community before the emergence of a strong Western presence in the region. The dissertation then identifies a local political reconfiguration triggered by the rapid penetration of foreign religions, especially Catholicism and Protestantism, on the heels of Wenzhou’s acquisition of treaty port status in 1877. Having characterized the nature of what I found to be an unparalleled reconfiguration of local politics, the project turns to the changing policies of local officials toward the area’s most important non-Christian religious event, the Dragon Boat Race, which had been held annually at Wenzhou since the thirteenth century. The dissertation closes with an examination of the policies of the Nationalist regime (1928-1949), focusing in particular on its concerns with indigenous local religious practice. My overall objective is to flesh out the extent to which the Nationalist Party-State apparatus succeeded in molding the common people’s daily life by combining old and new religious systems.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Brown University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Modern history, China, Local religion, Popular politics, Religion, Wenzhou",9,Providence,Rhode Island,41.823,-71.4187,United States

By focusing on a type of hydraulic structure in the Jianghan plain, the yuan (a diked enclosure), and analyzing the yuan communities' interactions with the state, I shall argue that the yuan became an arena for the state, society and ecology to interact. I also emphasize that the ecological exhaustion in late imperial and modern China was not caused principally by the state or the society, but by the interactions – the collaboration, negotiation, and competition – between the state and the hydraulic communities. It highlights various dynamisms of the triad interactions including minimal governance of the early Qing, the proto-conservationist efforts that were shadowed by the Manchu-Han tensions in the eighteenth century, the militarization agenda during the first half of the nineteenth century, and the unification efforts made by the early Republican and the Nationalist governments in the early twentieth century.

304787814,"Littell-Lamb, Elizabeth A.","Going public: The YWCA, “new” women, and social feminism in Republican China",Contemporary,"This dissertation is a study of how Chinese women used the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) to lead public lives in Republican China. I examine a group of women who shared elite backgrounds, Western-style educations and became involved with the YWCA either as lay leaders or professional executives or “secretaries” as they were called. These women reveal the complexity of the social group “new” women ( xin funü ) because, while they shared many characteristics, they did not necessarily share motivations, aspirations, or sociopolitical ideologies. The YWCA was one of several Sino-Western institutions that formed an “intercultural zone” which mediated exchanges between China and the West. It mediated institutional, professional and interpersonal relationships that provided women with the means to work out new conceptions of womanhood, experiment with new adaptive behaviors, negotiate new social roles, and to “go public,” the most visible way women defined themselves as “new.” Central to the question of why these women used the YWCA to “go public” is an understanding of how the Association indigenized to become a Chinese Association. Indigenization included two parallel processes, institution-building and devolution, or the transfer of power and authority from Western to Chinese women. Both processes were fraught with difficulties involving ongoing negotiations between Western and Chinese women as well as between successive generations of Chinese social feminists over issues of power and influence. The public lives of YWCA lay leaders and secretaries suggest the importance of social feminism among middle class urban women. Many scholars of “new” women in turn-of-the-century Europe and America point out that the majority of middle class women never subscribed to radical ideologies nor sought gender equality. However, neither did they accept social marginalization. They engaged in causes like child welfare and world peace that they could claim as their own because of their natural inclinations to be nurturers and humanitarians.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Carnegie Mellon University,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, China, Feminism, Women, YWCA",2,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States
2690000000,"Liu, Yuan","We Are Ginling: Chinese and Western Women Transform a Women's Mission College into an International Community, 1915-1987",Contemporary,"This dissertation will explore the short history of Ginling College, a women’s college established by American missionaries in Nanjing, China, lasting from 1915 to 1951. Ginling aimed to provide higher education to Chinese women and train women leaders for the advancement of Chinese Christianity. Between 1927 and 1928, the surging appeal of the Chinese to regain control over educational institutions in China pressed Ginling to Sinicize its administration. Under the Chinese leadership, Ginling continued to be managed cooperatively by an international body of women. During World War II, the college earned public acclaim for its service to Chinese refugees during the Nanjing Massacre of 1937 and its relief work for China’s government on its wartime campus at Chengdu, West China. After the war, Ginling navigated the furious political complexities of the Nationalist-Communist conflict. In 1951, it was combined with the University of Nanking. All its Western faculty went back to their home countries. However, through local alumnae associations all around the world, Ginling’s former Western faculty and overseas alumnae continued to sustain an active women’s community. After the economic reform of China in 1978, Ginling’s overseas alumnae and faculty reestablished contact with mainland China members. In 1987, through alumnae efforts, Ginling was rebuilt within Nanjing Normal University on its old campus. The Ginling Alumnae Association is still active today. Previous studies often accused the missionary project for overlooking the agency of local people and thus for deepening international misunderstanding. Taking Ginling as an example, this study shows that Western missionaries and Chinese people could have deep and effective communication. Ginling’s Western faculty and administrators cared about Chinese needs and respected Chinese agency. Meanwhile, Chinese agency in defending and facilitating the nationalistic cause of sovereignty, independence, and autonomy for China, was not necessarily an obstruction to the missionary movement, but smoothed the indigenization of a Western, Christian institution like Ginling. The long-lasting and rewarding international community created and sustained by Ginling women also demonstrated the positive function of “separate spheres” in encouraging women to pursue advanced education and jobs, and to define and strive for a common goal.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Case Western Reserve University,History,History,"Ginling College, Christian colleges and universities, Missions, Women missionaries, Collegiate women, Women colleges,",1,Cleveland,Ohio,41.4764,-81.6805,United States
304061191,"Skoggard, Ian Arvid",Dependency and rural industrialization in Taiwan: The history and organization of Taiwan's shoe industry,Contemporary,"Research was carried out in Taipei and central Taiwan during three visits between the summer of 1988 and the winter of 1990 for a total time of ten months. Methodology included surveys and interviews of entrepreneurs and workers in shoe factories, workshops and trading companies and in households. The dissertation also relied on extensive surveys and reports made by the Taiwan Footwear Manufacturing Association and the Department of Industry, Ministry of Economics. The dissertation looks at the factors which have influenced the decentralized organization of the shoe industry, Taiwan's third largest export industry. These factors include (i) the labor-intensive production process itself in which economy of scale provides no cost savings, (ii) the marketing-dependent relationship to the world market, (iii) the need for rural labor which is partly committed to domestic and farm work, (iv) the entrepreneurial behavior of local agents who want to realize a larger share of industry profits through ownership, and (v) the reliance on a culture of place to mediate labor relations. The dissertation counters the oversimplified conceptions of Taiwan's rural industry as an aggregation of mom and pop shops and instead reveals the complexity of the subcontracting system in which a three-level manufacturing process--factory, workshop and household production--is linked to large domestic petrochemical firms at one end and large foreign marketing and retail firms at the other end. The study also refutes the notion of compatibility between rural industry and agriculture and domestic work. The insatiable demand for rural labor spawned by export industry has pulled labor away from both farm and household, which has resulted in the degradation of agriculture and the traditional patterns of family reproduction.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,City University of New York,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, Social structure, China, rural development",1,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

304674517,"Ni, Huiliang",Sinicizing Jesus in the first half of the twentieth century—How Chinese Christians understood Jesus,Contemporary,"Before the Jesuits went to China in the seventeenth century, Christianity had already come and gone in China twice. Although the Jesuits deliberately adapted many Christian ideas to Chinese culture, which made them easier for the Chinese to accept, the idea of a crucified God remained alien to the Chinese and they continued to struggle with the image and work of Jesus over the next three hundred years. Nineteenth century missionaries were associated with the Western imperialism and cultural superiority, which gave Jesus imperialist overtones. Nonetheless, in the first half of the twentieth century Chinese Christians redefined Jesus across a wide spectrum from a radical social reformer to an extremely conservative personal savior. The controversy over the image of Jesus reflects the interaction between Chinese and the Western cultures, and Christianity as a world religion. This dissertation will examine the Chinese Christian understanding of Jesus and salvation in the first half of the twentieth-century by exploring the thought of three representative Chinese Christian theologians. I will argue that the Chinese Christian understanding is the fruit of the encounter between Chinese and Western cultures. Chinese Christians actively sought their own understandings based on their cultural and socio-political context as well as the needs of the Chinese church. The differences of the three Chinese Christian theologians in their philosophical and educational backgrounds and in their approaches to the Christian Scriptures differentiated their understandings of Jesus and salvation. They redefined Jesus and his work by casting Jesus or meaning of salvation or both in Chinese terms and in relation to Chinese tradition to solve their contemporary problems and answer the questions of their age, namely, how to save China as a nation, how to defend Christianity in the face of nationalism and communism, how to answer the challenge from science and rationalism, how to reconcile Christianity with Chinese culture and tradition, and how to meet the needs of Chinese church and root it into Chinese soil.

From 1963, a steady trickle of Chinese doctors and nurses arrived in Algeria, providing health care for rural and suburban communities, before expanding their care throughout the continent of Africa. This dissertation explores the experiences of the medical mission workers in Algeria during the first two decades of China’s medical aid program. It documents the rise of a globalizing China in the post-colonial world through the highly significant, yet heretofore overlooked, medical and humanitarian networks between Chinese provincial health institutions and Algerian medical facilities. It shows that the exchange of medical technology, drugs, and practices between China and Algeria crossed not only physical borders, but also boundaries between different systems of medicine and visions of development. Amidst the geopolitics of the Cold War, Chinese medical aid formed an alternative model of postcolonial international health care intervention in Third World countries. Central to this model was what I call “Chinese socialist medicine,” a body of hybrid medical knowledge and socialized health care delivery. Chinese socialist medicine not only challenged medical elitism by devising new, egalitarian approaches and ethical models, but also heavily relied on improvised medical technology and “scientized” acupuncture, which crossed epistemological boundaries between Western and Chinese medicines. Using a combination of Chinese, Arabic, and French textual and video sources, oral interviews, and clinical observations, this study analyzes the mobilization of human resources to Algeria, the application of mixed technologies of biomedicine and Chinese medicine, efforts to build medical supply infrastructure to manage local health problems, and China’s ambitions to transplant Chinese socialist healthcare ethics and ideals to Algerian communities. During this process, China’s socialist medicine emerged as a hybrid and flexible product of Maoist ideals for social welfare and internationalism. It constantly redrew its boundaries in Algeria by competing with medical missions from other socialist countries and recruiting local health actors to its enterprise. The dissertation argues that China’s medical aid in the form of socialist medicine was a channel for the projection of China’s soft power in global health governance. It demonstrates that medicine and internationalism were integral to China’s political history in the Mao period. Mao’s China was hardly “xenophobic” or inwardly focused, but rather tangibly connected with the rest of the world by flows of people, ideas, materials, and technologies. Socialist China during this era was in fact committed to building its global presence through networks of soft power, including humanitarian aid and medicine. Resting at the intersection of Cold War politics, the history of medicine, and global humanitarianism, the dissertation shows that China’s medical missions served as an ideological and methodological alternative in postcolonial health management within the global South.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Algeria, China, Cold War, Humanitarianism, Medical mission, Socialist medicine,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

For the Western Zhou state, Shandong was the “Far East” and it was a vast region of diverse landscape and complex cultural traditions during the Late Bronze-Age (1000–500 BCE). In this research, the developmental trajectories of three different types of secondary states are examined. The first type is the regional states established by the Zhou court. the second type is the indigenous Non-Zhou states with Dong Yi origins. the third type is the states that may have been formerly Shang polities and accepted Zhou rule after the Zhou conquest of Shang. On the one hand, this dissertation examines the dynamic social and cultural process in the eastern periphery in relation to the expansion and colonization of the Western Zhou state. on the other hand, it emphasizes the agency of the periphery during the formation of secondary states by examining how the polities in the periphery responded to the advances of the Western Zhou state and how local traditions impacted the composition of the local material assemblage which lay the foundation for the future prosperity of the regional culture. By utilizing the rich archaeological data, epigraphic evidence and textual sources, the dissertation focuses on two research questions: First, how did cultural interactions play out in the region through possible processes of cultural adaption, assimilation, persistence, and resistance, and what are their material manifestations in the archaeological record? Second, how did the political relationship between the peripheral states and the dynastic center change in variable degrees of dependency or autonomy?

304500192,"Yuen, Aida Yuen","Inventing Eastern art in Japan and China, ca. 1890s to ca. 1930s",Contemporary,"The concept of the East as a unified cultural entity that emerged in late-nineteenth-century Japan had profound effects on the understanding of art in modern Japan and China. It inspired new trends in painting, historiography, and art theory, and prompted explorations of the relationship between regional identity and cultural practices. Paintings that combine fragments of Asian history drawn from classical tales with Western pictorial techniques, and works that synthesized native and foreign styles enjoyed widespread popularity. Painters influenced by the nationalistic art activist Okakura Tenshin were major producers of these works. The concept of the East, which was founded upon the idea of intercultural bonds, also provided an impetus for extensive interchange between the Japanese and Chinese art worlds. A series of joint exhibitions held during the interwar years exemplified this interaction. During this period changing patterns of collecting Chinese art in Japan transformed Japanese knowledge of Chinese painting history. Naitō Konan's ground-breaking History of Chinese Painting (1922–1923) was based almost entirely on works imported into Japan since the 1910s. It reflected a new commitment to keep Eastern cultural artifacts in the East. The ideal of individualism prevalent in the Taishō period became associated with traditional forms of Eastern culture and suddenly allowed literati painting to be re-constituted as a symbol of modernity. Komuro Suiun, Taki Seiichi, Ōmura Seigai, and Chen Hengke pointed to precursors of modern individualism in what they portrayed as the Eastern expressions of subjectivism inherent in literati painting.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Art, China, Japan",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2235847174,"Wang, Yijun","From Tin to Pewter: Craft and Statecraft in China, 1700–1844",Modern,"This dissertation examines the transmissions of technology and changes in the culture of statecraft by tracing the itinerary of tin from ore in mines to everyday objects. From the eighteenth century, with the expansion of the Qing empire and global trade, miners migrated from the east coast of China to the southwest frontiers of the Qing empire (1644–1912) and into Southeast Asia, bringing their mining technology with them. The tin from Southeast Asia, in return, inspired Chinese pewter artisans to invent new styles and techniques of metalworking. Furthermore, the knowledge of mining, metalworking, and trade was transferred from miners, artisans, and merchants into the knowledge system of scholar-officials, gradually changing the culture of statecraft in the Qing dynasty. This dissertation explores how imperial expansion and the intensive material exchange brought by global trade affected knowledge production and transmission, gradually changing the culture of statecraft in China. In the Qing dynasty, people used tin, the component of two common alloys, pewter and bronze, to produce objects of daily use as well as copper coins. Thus, tin was not only important to people's everyday lives, but also to the policy-making of the Qing state. In this way, tin offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate artisans and intellectuals' approach to technology, while it also provides a vantage point from which to examine how Qing bureaucrats managed the world, a world of human and non-human resources. My dissertation stands at the intersection of the history of science and technology, art history, intellectual history, and the history of global trade. It broadens the scope of the history of science in China by demonstrating how artisans' practice was crucial to the production of mining treatises. It contributes to the study of science, technology, and society by showing that the transmission of and innovations in technology should be situated in the context of social, cultural, trade, and ecological networks. Finally, I argue that mid-Qing scholars' efforts to collect practical knowledge changed the culture of governance from Confucian moral didacticism to technocratic epistemology. Qing bureaucrats, Manchu and Han alike, utilized practical knowledge from artisans and merchants in their policy-making process. By emphasizing the entanglement of technology and statecraft, my project contributes to intellectual history and enhances our understanding of the logic of bureaucracy of the Qing empire. My dissertation consists of five chapters. Each chapter uses different methodologies and covers different geographical regions. Chapter One engages with the history of science by demonstrating how scholars translated and codified miners' vernacular knowledge of mining into mining treatises. Chapter Two examines the semi-autonomous mining community in Yunnan to illustrate that the social organization of miners, which I define as the social technology of mining, contributed to the formation of the capital- and labor- intensive mining industry. Chapter Three moves to the island of Bangka (in present-day Indonesia) and focuses on the transmission of mining technology from China to Southeast Asia. Through comparison, I show that the miners in Yunnan and Bangka formed similar (semi-)autonomous social organizations. I argue that it was this social technology that enabled the transmission of Chinese mining technology across geographical regions and laid the foundation for the Chinese dominance of the mining industry in Bangka. The cases of Chinese mining technology in Yunnan and Bangka challenge the modern understanding of technology by showing that technology was not just about tools and machines. Before the 1850s, both Qing bureaucrats and European colonizers considered the social organization of mining to be critical to technological progress. Chapter Four moves back to China to study the formation of Guangdong style pewter. Utilizing visual and material sources, I examine how the introduction of tin from Southeast Asia led to innovations in metallurgy, and how European silver and porcelain inspired stylistic changes. I argue that technology and innovations should be understood in the context of social, economic, material and ecological networks. The final chapter moves to Beijing and Jiangnan area to engage with the institutional history of the Qing empire. Through a case study of monetary reform undertaken in 1740, this chapter reveals that Qing bureaucrats acquired and applied practical expertise to their administrative work. Through their close interactions with artisans and merchants, Qing bureaucrats developed a distinctive vision of statecraft (jingshi). Before the late nineteenth century, the sovereignty of the Qing state was not exercised in the extraction and monopoly over natural resources. Instead, the Qing state relied on the market to acquire most of the natural resources they needed.

I explore this history of competition by highlighting two dimensions of economic and intellectual change: the intensification of agrarian labor and the synchronous emergence of new paradigms of economic thought. As tea exports from China and India soared and competition grew fiercer, planters, factory overseers, peasants, and government officials shifted their attention from the wealth-creating possibilities of commerce to the value-creating potential of labor and industrial production. This study also historically situates two older, teleological assumptions in the field of Asian economic history: the inevitability of industrialization and of proletarianization. Both assumptions emerged from social and economic transformations during the nineteenth century. In particular, periodic market crises compelled Chinese and colonial Indian officials to seriously question older Smithian theories premised upon the sphere of circulation. Instead, both regional industries pursued interventionist measures focused on the abode of production. In India, officials passed special laws for indentured labor recruitment. In China, reformers organized tea peasants and workers into agrarian cooperatives. Finally, colonial officials and Bengali reformers in India agreed that they needed to liberate the unfree coolie from the shackles of unfree labor. And in China, reformers articulated a critique of rentier comprador merchants and moneylenders who exploited peasant labor. Thus, although the coolie and comprador became twentieth-century symbols of Asian economic backwardness, they were each, as concepts, produced by profound social and economic changes that were dynamic, eventful, and global in nature.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,History,History,"Asian History, Modern history, South Asian Studies, Capitalism, China, India, Labor, Political economic thought, Tea trade",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1695739770,"Wang, Sixiang","Co-constructing Empire in Early Choson Korea: Knowledge Production and the Culture of Diplomacy, 1392-1592",Modern,"Political, military, and economic power alone cannot explain how empires work, for empire-making is also a matter of theories, narratives, ideas and institutions. To sustain themselves, empires both coerce and persuade. Tools of persuasion, however, were seldom the monopoly of those who sought to dominate, for they could also be contested and appropriated by those who sought to resist. This dissertation on Chosoˇn Korea’s (1392–1910) interactions with Ming China (1368–1644) offers a cultural history of interstate orders and diplomatic institutions in early modern Korea and East Asia. I illustrate how Chosoˇn appropriated the persuasive technologies that sustained Ming empire as a political imaginary to contest Ming imperial claims and ultimately reshape imperial ideology. Chosoˇn-Ming relations have long been described in terms of “tributary relations.” This paradigm, as conceived by John K. Fairbank and others, understands these relations as the logical consequence of a shared Confucian ideology and illustrative of Korea’s historical status as China’s model tributary. These approaches privilege a metropole-centered vantage and have failed to account for Korean agency. They treat Korean envoy missions, ritual performances, and literary production as scripted gestures that can only reflect stable ideology. Meanwhile, they miss how these acts were contesting and transforming ideology in the process. I argue that the Chosoˇn court in fact exercised enormous agency through these ritualized practices. The discourses of the Ming as moral empire and Korea as a loyal vassal, long held to be emblematic features of the tributary system, were a large part reified products of Chosoˇn diplomatic strategy. They did not reflect a pre-existing political order, but constituted its very substance. They were part of the “knowledge of empire” produced by the Chosoˇn court for comprehending the Ming and its institutions and influencing imperial ideology. Facilitated by institutional practices at the Chosoˇn court, this “knowledge of empire” allowed Chosoˇn to manage successfully asymmetrical relations with the Ming and co-construct Ming empire in the process. Chapter 1 examines Korean diplomatic epistles to show how the Korean court used its knowledge of historical precedents, ritual logics, and literary tropes of empire-making to contest symbols of imperial legitimacy. Chapter 2 discusses how Korean emissaries appealed to ideals of moral empire and reified particular understandings of Korea’s relationship with the Ming to achieve their diplomatic ends. Chapter 3 treats Korean envoy missions as a conduit for information on Ming institutions and politics. As a result, the Chosoˇn was able to construct a dynamic of knowledge asymmetry where it knew more about the Ming than vice-versa. Once empire was constructed, its symbols and institutions were subject to appropriation. Chapter 4 looks at one such example, where a Korean prince manipulated diplomacy with the Ming to usurp the Chosoˇn throne. Chapter 5 shows how the practices of envoy poetry associated with the Brilliant Flowers Anthology (Hwanghwajip) became a site where competing narratives of how Chosoˇn’s relationship to empire, civilization, and the imperial past could stand together. Chapter 6 continues the discussion of envoy poetry by turning to its associated spatial practices. Chosoˇn court poets invested the city of P’y?ngyang with symbolic resonances that asserted Korean cultural parity with China, legitimized Korean autonomy and denounced historical imperial claims on Korean territory, all without infringing on Ming claims of universal empire.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Asian literature, Asian History, History, Choson korea, Diplomacy and culture, Early modern diplomacy, Empire, Ming dynasty, Ritual and literature",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304599107,"D'Argenio, Linda","Bureaucrats, gentlemen, poets: The role of poetry in the literati culture of tenth–eleventh century China (960–1022)",Medieval,"This study discusses early Song poetry from the founding of the dynasty (960) through the reign of emperor Zhenzong (998–1022). It focuses on the transition from Tang to Song poetry by highlighting the elements of continuity as well as the main differences in the poetry of these two periods. My discussion is based on the hypothesis that there existed a relationship between the evolution of the shi , identified as the learned elite which formed the pool of potential civil servants, and the changes that intervened in poetry writing as an activity characteristic of this group. This study shows that alongside the rise of the bureaucracy's power vis-à-vis imperial authority, poetry gradually evolved into a medium partially disengaged from imperial patronage and increasingly expressive of the elite's ethical and cultural values. Meanwhile, in the second half of the period under consideration one witnesses an unprecedented rise to literary notoriety by poets who were active outside or at the margins of the elite, such as members of the Buddhist clergy, hermits and recluses, and country gentlemen. This hypothesis has been tested and illustrated through the analysis of three poetic styles, which, according to Song sources, formed the principal poetic trends at the outset of the dynasty. These were: (1)&#xa0.the Bai style or Yuan-Bai style, based on the imitation of Bai Juyi (772–846) and, in particular, on the exchange of poetry between Bai and Yuan Zhen (779–831). (2)&#xa0.the Xikun style, that is, the poetry of Yang Yi (974–1020), Liu Yun (970–1030) and Qian Weiyan (977–1034), who were admirers of the Tang poet Li Shangyin (813–858) and whose work is collected in the anthology of exchange verses titled Xikun chouchangji .

863584239,"Fromm, Martin","Producing History through ‘Wenshi Ziliao’: Personal Memory, Post-Mao Ideology, and Migration to Manchuria",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the intersection of memory, ideology, and migration as it unfolded in the process of wenshi ziliao historical production. It argues that the post-Mao state's project of mobilizing memory for the consolidation of Party-led national re-integration after the chaos of the Cultural Revolution created a unique set of conditions for the articulation and reconciliation of complex individual subjectivities. The multiple positionalities of the different participants in the project, in their roles as editors and narrators, inscribed onto ideological production an inter-subjective creative process that was both integral to and threatened to spill outside of the Party-sponsored national framework. The competing imperatives of the Party's revolutionary legacy, market reform, and nationalism, of continuity and discontinuity, were reflected in and reinforced by fissured collective representations of the pre-1949 historical experience. These simultaneous modes of producing knowledge about the past in turn constituted a discursive lens through which the project's participants, reflecting on their own life histories, made sense out of and reconciled contradictions within their personal experiences as migrants to Manchuria in the early twentieth century. The entangled objectives of state ideology provided a set of resources whereby the former migrants articulated their own competing priorities and ambiguous position at the interstices of empire, nation, market, and family. This conjoining of post-Mao reforms with memories of migration to Manchuria took place in the context of and became the stimulus for other East Asian memory projects. Globalizing market approaches to national development became tied to the emergence of new regional identities and migration strategies rooted in the historical experience and retrospective articulation of Manchuria's contested colonization.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, China, Ideology, Manchuria, Memory, Migration, Personal narrative, Post-Mao",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304860547,"Cook, Alexander C.",Unsettling accounts: The trial of the “Gang of Four”. Narratives of justice and humanity in the aftermath of China's Cultural Revolution,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the struggle to salvage socialist ideals of humanity and justice from the rubble of China's Cultural Revolution. The dramatic trial of top Maoist leaders (the Gang of Four) in the winter of 1980-1981 symbolized a striking historical transition, from violent radicalism to a reformed and revitalized socialism. This new ideology would be focused on modernization, guided by scientific principles, and ordered by the rule of law. The Gang of Four trial is an important example of post-conflict transitional justice, but in a uniquely Chinese, socialist context. This trial wrought transitional justice by appropriating culturally-established, Chinese concepts of justice and reformulating them into socialist terms. Specifically, the trial promised to settle accounts with the Cultural Revolution in three ways: by delivering legal retribution to wrongdoers (expressed as suan zhang ), by providing closure on the collective trauma of the past ( ping minfen ), and by documenting a comprehensive interpretation of history ( zhengyi ). However, this legal project to narrate the post-Cultural Revolution transition had important limitations. A sustained comparison with key literary works reveals themes absent from or repressed by the legal narrative. Liu Binyan's reportage piece Between Man and Monsters provided an alternative indictment, arguing that the illegality of the Cultural Revolution was rooted in its inhumanity, a problem that could only be addressed by the active engagement of individuals outside the state structure. In contrast with the objective fact-finding of the court, Dai Houying's novel Man Ah, Man! used literary testimony to illustrate the necessity of subjective human emotion in history. And unlike the trial's sweeping verdict, Yang Jiang's memoir Six Records of a Cadre School showed the danger and futility of grand interpretations. This study is not only the first history of China's most famous legal trial, it is also a fundamental reinterpretation of law and justice in China's little-studied post-Mao transition. Thus my research links the long history of Chinese justice with major themes of global contemporary history: the trauma of mass violence, skepticism of political modernism as a blueprint for rebuilding, and the search for new ways of knowing and speaking about the past.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Law, China, Cultural Revolution, Gang of Four, Humanity, Justice, Narratives, Rule of law, Trial",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

But the drive to secure autonomous sources of energy to propel economic development and protect national security well predates China’s transition to socialism at midcentury. This dissertation explores the emergence of technocratic state rule in 20th century China by investigating the development of a biofuel industry designed to ensure energy security during war with imperial Japan. During the early to mid-1930s, Chiang Kai-Shek’s KMT government began supporting scientific research on ethanol-based biofuel production as a means of preserving fuel supplies should Japanese forces successfully blockade supply routes into the country during wartime. As exactly this scenario came to pass in the late 1930s, a network of more than 100 private and state-run ethanol plants were constructed along new roadways spanning the country’s southwestern interior. By 1945, millions of gallons a year of ethanol-based “dongli jiujing” fueled the logistical chains of both Chinese and US troops stationed throughout the China theater. The fusion of statecraft and science manifested in the dongli jiujing program both points forward to state-led energy and heavy industrial development in the 1950s and 1960s under Mao’s CCP, and represents one of the top accomplishments of KMT agencies like the National Resources Commission, a powerful technocratic agency which held up the wartime biofuel industry as a paradigmatic example of successful state-led economic development. While scholarship on heavy industry in China often focuses on the latter half of the 20th century, this dissertation demonstrates that by the mid 1930s, the development of the biofuel industry welded political visions for a sovereign, industrially powerful China with the technical expertise of chemists and microbiologists at the National Bureau of Industrial Research (NBIR), a state funded institution for applied science research oriented at developing heavy industries. And it points out that many of the scientists involved in the dongli jiujing program would continue development work in fields like agricultural chemistry and the biochemical industry under the CCP. Engaging with and contributing to recent scholarship on the history of science and technology in Asia, “Mobilizing Microbes” also traces the global circulation of fermentation-related knowledge that informed NBIR attempts to harness microbial life for the industrial production of alcohol. And finally, it explores connections that brought together in unexpected ways the craft knowledge and practices of China’s domestic brewing industry with modernizing visions for a powerful, fully sovereign China propounded by scientists and statesmen as the midpoint of the 20th century drew near.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Biofuel, Chemistry, Microbiology, Renewable energy, Republican China,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

Through the lenses of two treatises authored by Jesuit missionaries serving at the Chinese Imperial Court––one introducing Western music to China, the other introducing Chinese music to France––I investigate how music and the system of knowledge represented by each treatise challenged their audience's worldview: although their interpretation differed, both the Europeans and the Chinese acknowledged China as the origin of the Western civilization. I argue that this construction of a universal history that accommodates all cultures on a single timeline shows there was a common effort across the globe to systematize the diversity of the world's musical cultures into one coherent principle and, more importantly, that the Enlightenment did not originate in Europe but was built on a shared effort of the East and the West to use history to make sense of the expanding globe. My research offers a new model for musicological studies by situating music at the intersection between East Asian Studies, Mission Studies, History of Science, and Global History. Moreover, it challenges the preconceived notion of the Enlightenment as a purely European phenomenon and argues instead that the Enlightenment was global at its inception. In doing so, it moves beyond the framework of dissemination and the comparative approach that characterize much of the past scholarship on global history. Emphasizing simultaneous emergence over successive development and integration over connection, I examine how local societies actively incorporated foreign systems of knowledge in the face of globalizing forces and how this incorporation not only expanded but also transformed their conception of the world.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,Music,Arts,"China, Enlightenment, France, global history, Jesuit, Kangxi,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

I reframe my examination within a broader context of international imperialism and Japanese reception of modern architecture during the first half of the twentieth century and argue that the dynamic interactions among the Japanese, Russian, and Chinese politicians and architects mutually shaped the international cityscapes in Manchuria. Moreover, I examine Japanese architects’ writings and buildings to illustrate how they regulated the indigenous and former colonial spaces and constructed a modern living space in Manchuria through the development of residential houses. In contrast to the conventional understanding of Japanese building activities in Manchuria as architecture propaganda, my dissertation highlights the role of social class and visual representation in shaping the public experience of space in Manchuria. The development of colonial tourism and its visual products, including tourist postcards, commercial photographs, and guidebooks, constructed a controlled spatial experience and selective landscapes that overshadowed the colonial living space. Engaging with previous scholarship, recent historical studies, and new archival materials, I map out multiple urban and social layers—including imperialist and nationalist, public and private, collective and individual, tangible and conceptual spaces—and illustrate how these layers overlapped and intertwined with each other.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,Art History and Archaeology,Art History and Archaeology,"Communication and the arts, Social sciences, Cityscape of prewar changchun, Colonial urban planning, Housing in prewar Dalian, Modernist architecture in colonial Manchuria, Residential architecture in colonial Manchuria, Urban space of colonial Manchuria,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1712386832,"Detwyler, Anatoly","The Aesthetics of Information in Modern Chinese Literary Culture, 1919-1949",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the literary and cultural history of information in modern China from 1919 to 1949. This era witnessed a kind of communications revolution, marked by the rapid proliferation of new ways of transmitting and inscribing information, which joined other revolutions (sociopolitical, linguistic) in ushering in the modern subject. In the form of xiaoxi, xinxi, or tongji, “information” became an essential entity by which to understand and implement modern practices cropping up throughout China—from statistical knowledge to political propaganda, from stock speculation to new virtual communities. This dissertation uses four case studies to revisit familiar writers such as Mao Dun (1896-1981), Ding Ling (1904-1986), and Shen Congwen (1902-1988), while also excavating a number of innovative figures such as the avant-garde psychologist, Zhang Yaoxiang (1893-1964), and the communications critic, Xie Liuyi (1898-1945), to show how the rise of a modern literary culture is inseparable from the rise of this early information era, when writers, critics, and artists collectively developed new modes of literary representation, critical reading, and visualizing information. New fiction did not simply passively reflect the spread of information into everyday life or changes in China’s information order. Rather, as writers and critics integrated forms of information into their work, even envisioning literature itself as a kind of medium of information, they contributed to what I call an emergent “aesthetics of information.” Why did forms like the database or the encyclopedia inspire new modes of literary composition? How could literary forms incorporate or critique forms of data organization such as account books or statistical tables? When did information provide new ways of constructing the real—and when did literary realism seem directly opposed to the abstractive and disembodying qualities of information? The aesthetics of information directly and creatively engaged with information in a variety of ways, sometimes by way of a process of absorption and appropriation, and at other times through a more oppositional logic of resistance in the form of critique, unmasking, or satire. Ultimately the lens of “information” sheds new light on the development of modern Chinese literature, while also contributing a crucial piece to the broader mosaic of modern information’s global history. It thereby historicizes the early foundations of many of the hallmarks of postindustrial life and culture in China today: the spread of abstraction, the rise of white-collar information management, and the increasingly important role of network communications in modulating sociality and politics.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Comparative literature, Asian literature, Asian History, Chinese literature, Communication, Information, New media",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1513242422,"Zhong, Yurou","Script crisis and literary modernity in China, 1916-1958",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the modern Chinese script crisis in twentieth-century China. It situates the Chinese script crisis within the modern phenomenon of phonocentrism - the systematic privileging of speech over writing. It depicts the Chinese experience as an integral part of a worldwide crisis of non-alphabetic scripts in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It places the crisis of Chinese characters at the center of the making of modern Chinese language, literature, and culture. It investigates how the script crisis and the ensuing script revolution intersect with significant historical processes such as the Chinese engagement in the two World Wars, national and international education movements, the Communist revolution, and national salvation. Since the late nineteenth century, the Chinese writing system began to be targeted as the roadblock to literacy, science and democracy. Chinese and foreign scholars took the abolition of Chinese script to be the condition of modernity. A script revolution was launched as the Chinese response to the script crisis. This dissertation traces the beginning of the crisis to 1916, when Chao Yuen Ren published his English article The Problem of the Chinese Language, sweeping away all theoretical oppositions to alphabetizing the Chinese script. This was followed by two major movements dedicated to the task of eradicating Chinese characters: First, the Chinese Romanization Movement spearheaded by a group of Chinese and international scholars which was quickly endorsed by the Guomingdang (GMD) Nationalist government in the 1920s. Second, the dissident Chinese Latinization Movement initiated in the Soviet Union and championed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the 1930s. This crisis was brought to an abrupt end in 1958, when Zhou Enlai, the first premier of the People's Republic of China, relegated the Romanization system pinyin to an official auxiliary status, secondary to Chinese characters, thus concluding the half-century struggle between the Chinese script and the alphabet. The final containment of the script crisis was partly a political decision of the new socialist state, and partly the result of the use of  baihua . The multivalent term baihua --plain speech, vernacular, and a colloquialized written language--enabled an unlikely reconciliation between the phonocentric dreams of a Chinese alphabet and a character-based Chinese national language and literature. This alternative solution to the script crisis, which grew from within the Chinese script, was rehearsed in the first modern Chinese anti-illiteracy program in France during the Great War. The solution was consolidated as a colloquialized written Chinese became the staple of modern Chinese literary writing. The negotiated baihua --imprinted profoundly by the phonocentric-biased discourse--on the one hand registers the historical reality of the modern Chinese writing as a written language. on the other, it keeps alive the phonocentric dreams of modern China.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Comparative literature, Literature, History, Latinization, Modern chinese literature, Phonocentrism, Romanization, Script crisis, Yutiwen",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
750161387,"So, Richard Jean","Coolie democracy: U.S.-China political and literary exchange, 1925-1955",Contemporary,"In the 1930s and 1940s, a group of American and Chinese writers traversed the Pacific in search of an alternative model of Western democracy. A diverse group of intellectuals – white and Asian, male and female, Black and Chinese-American – encountered each other in America and China and worked together to create new forms of politics and literature. A community was born through such reciprocal encounters. In New York City, Pearl Buck and Lin Yutang invented new aesthetic forms, such as synthetic realism, to generate a vision of equality as harmonized across American and Chinese contexts. In Shanghai, Langston Hughes and Lu Xun co-authored a series of manifestos to redefine democracy as an international, rather than purely nation-based, concept. The outcome of such migrations and meetings was a radical new vision of collectivity and human freedom: what Buck dubbed, coolie democracy. Specifically, this group of writers valorized the degraded figure of the coolie, or Chinese laborer, to re-define U.S. democracy at its threshold. They argued that the coolie, in its distance from Western modernity, unexpectedly revealed a potentially more natural state of agency, despite its subjected status. Moreover, they linked this figure to democracy in order to criticize American society's inability to absorb such marginal subjects. In its triple subjection – economic, racial, imperial – the coolie articulated a timely critique of American democracy by linking it to East Asian colonialism. This dissertation examines this idea of coolie democracy to explore interactions between U.S. and Chinese literary systems during the interwar years. Drawing on two years of archival research in China and America and bilingual close readings, I argue that coolie democracy does not model a form of core-periphery cultural exchange, but rather, it engendered an intermediate space between American and Chinese cultures that enabled intellectual reciprocity. Collaboration at the interstices of nations provoked new political and aesthetic concepts, which I argue, served to foment the mutual transformation of post-war American and Chinese cultural systems.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"Comparative literature, Modern literature, Asian literature, History, American history, American literature, International law, Buck, Pearl S., China, Coolie, Lao, She, Lin, Yutang, Smedley, Agnes, Trans-Pacific, United States",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2680000039,"Yi, Yuan","Malfunctioning Machinery: the Global Making of Chinese Cotton Mills, 1877-1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation is a study of the mechanization of cotton spinning in turn-of-the-twentieth-century China. More specifically, it examines efforts made by the Chinese workers to keep imported spinning machines performing at maximum efficiency in their cotton mills. Such efforts ranged from customizing and modifying machines to suit the specific needs of individual cotton mills to repairing broken machines, maintaining aging machines, and sourcing parts locally by copying the originals. It also addresses endeavors made beyond the shop floor such as the cultivation of cotton varieties that better accommodated machine spinning and knowledge production of spinning technology and cotton cultivation in professional journals. The study of industrialization, especially regarding the rise of factory workers as a new social class, was once a popular topic for social historians and feminist scholars in the China field. Previous scholarship investigated the fragmented nature of the Chinese working class in terms of gender, skill, and native places, with detailed accounts of the workers’ daily lives. However, these studies have paid little attention to the actual process of mechanization. Mechanization on the Chinese shop floor was far from smooth, since foreign machines malfunctioned for various reasons at different stages of operation, requiring continuous adjustment, maintenance, and repair. Without an examination of this challenging process, we underestimate the Chinese as passive recipients of machines and technologies, under the assumption that Western machinery was a one-size-fits-all instrument for Chinese industrialization. My dissertation rectifies this neglect by reconstructing the concrete process of mechanization from a technological perspective. It draws upon a variety of technical writings such as machine manufacturers’ manuals, their contracts with client mills, engineering journals, agricultural reports, and factory regulations. It also revisits more conventional sources such as interviews with former factory workers. A critical reading of these sources reveals that Chinese engineers, machinists, and female machine operators strived to solve technological problems specific to their factories, with multiple layers of knowledge obtained through hands-on experience of machines and cotton as well as formal engineering education. All these human efforts to make better use of machines under varying financial, technological, and material conditions of each cotton mill, combined with larger political and social circumstances, determined the course of mechanization in China. The factory system in China was thus a craftwork, locally made on the basis of the global circulation of machines and technologies. By highlighting the process of mechanization, rather than mere importation of machines, this study makes interventions into the discussion of Chinese industrialization and, beyond that, into debates about industrialization and technology transfer more generally. First, in exploring a range of handwork performed by technical experts at different stages of mechanization, it argues for the significance of manual labor in the making of the factory system, thereby complicating the long-held dichotomy between craft and mechanization. Second, by demonstrating how new sets of knowledge were created on the Chinese shop floor in the course of using foreign machines, it challenges the assumption that technology transfer simply emanated from the West to be disseminated to the rest of the world.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Cotton spinning, Craft, Factory system, Industrialization, Mechanization, Technology transfer,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

The “feudal,” oppressive “old society” ( jiushehui ) had to be destroyed, and on its ruins a “new society” ( xinshehui ) was to be built under the party's leadership. This thesis seeks to understand the dynamics of the interplay between the state and society in China during the last four decades of communist rule, or how communist party-state social and political “revolutionary” engineering has articulated with traditional patterns of sociocultural reproduction. This is done by investigating how the state and the most basic unit of Chinese rural society, the family, have interacted at the local level and how this interaction was mediated and negotiated by local human actors and shaped by local socioeconomic and historical forces. As the thesis documents, the social and economic position of the family in rural society was powerfully modified by the various doings and undoings of the Maoist party-state and yet, despite these state-imposed changes, the family has retained many of its traditional dimensions. In view of the resilience of the familial institution along mostly “traditional” lines, including the many “traditional” strategies and values with which it continues to orient its members' lives, the thesis questions finally the ability of the Chinese party-state to challenge the reproduction and sustenance of most of the basic hegemonic assumptions on which rested the traditional sociocultural order, assumptions which the party-state has ceaselessly targeted to establish in their place its own hegemonic meanings and practices.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, China, Communist Party, Family, Party-state, Political reform, Social reform, Society",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304620612,"Koga, Yukiko",The double inheritance: The afterlife of colonial modernity in the cities of former “Manchuria”,Contemporary,"Both China and Japan seek, for their own reasons, to erase traces of Japan's former empire. The region once known as Manchuria has long been consigned to the distant past. Yet now that Northeast China seeks investment and tourism from abroad, the cities of former Manchuria have become key spaces for Chinese and Japanese to encounter their complex history. At times the past erupts violently in the present, as when construction accidentally unearths toxic weapons buried by the Japanese Army at war's end. At other times, the past appears in heated debates over preserving colonial-era architecture and sites of memory. And at others, it lingers surreptitiously in the offices and factories of the fast moving, market-oriented Chinese economy. In all the cases, however, the introduction of the market economy in China has created a new dynamic concerning the past, as the cities seek to turn their colonial inheritance into capital. This dissertation explores the afterlife of colonial modernity in the former site of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo by tracing colonial inheritance in Harbin, Changchun and Dalian, three major cities in Northeast China. In recent years these cities have placed the historical preservation of colonial-era architecture center stage in their efforts to redefine their image as modern. Through ethnographic and historiographic observations, this dissertation illuminates how renewed urban space functions at the juncture of a multitude of posts—post-colonial, post-imperial, post-socialist, post-Cold War, and post-postwar aspirations and anxieties—which have become pronounced as both China and Japan are ever more immersed in the globalized economy. This study illustrates how this conjuncture questions, articulates, and redefines what it means to be modern, and, to that end, what it takes to redress colonial violence. It goes beyond conventional discussions of Japan's war responsibility to locate the question of coming to terms with the past within the daily articulation and pursuit of modernity.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, International law, China, Inheritance, Japan, Manchuria, Political economy, Urban space",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

Strategies of domestic organization, resource allocation, network building, and marriage alliances are analyzed in their symbolic and historical contexts in order to describe loci of cultural continuity and change, and explore patterns of social stratification. The study is based on participant observation fieldwork and 160 semi-structured interviews conducted during eight months of residence with a local family (May-October 1990,) and supplemented by documentary research. After an ecological and historical overview, the family (jia) is examined as structure and process. A literature review considers problems of definition and the difficulties Western theorists have faced in interpreting the habitus which generates and is reproduced by family dynamics. Detailed data on Willow Pond family size, structure, and division/formation practices are examined, revealing periods of demographic stress in the community, particularly small average family size, a long-standing tendency to early family division, a somewhat attenuated patrilineal emphasis, and the resilience of the basic principles of family organization over time. Supra-jia kin groups and processes are examined next. Lineage organization was not strong here, but local agnatic descent groups, zegazei, are recognized, with permeable boundaries that mark bodies of official and practical kin. By manipulation of kinship terminology and fictive kinship (ganqin), matrilateral and affinal kin can be encompassed in a patrilineal idiom, and social differentiation mystified as reciprocal solidarity. Finally, marriage patterns and practices over 60 years are discussed as strategies of social reproduction. Description and analysis of marriage economics and ritual through time reveal signs of assortative pairing, suggesting processes of class formation.

Supplementing modern and classical Chinese sources with multilingual materials in Tibetan, Mongolian, Manchu, Japanese, and a range of European languages, my research diversifies scholarly understanding of China’s development as a nation by emphasizing the significant roles of Inner Asian peoples in building the Qing empire. I argue that, instead of a marginal hinterland, Inner Asia was the contact zone that brought Eurasian cultures and knowledge systems together. Moreover, this work challenges the binary discourse of metropole/periphery in the history of imperialism, colonialism, and globalization by demonstrating that the integration of knowledge systems in modern Eurasia started from Inner Asia. Engaging with the scholarship of comparative world history, I argue for the Great Convergence, a novel term that signifies the information exchange, economic integration, and knowledge formation that mobile communities and intelligence networks in Inner Asia facilitated between China, South Asia, and Europe. My research features interdisciplinary methods that bridge the gap between international history and world philology, among other disciplines. This dissertation analyzes information and economic networks between China and Inner Asia. More broadly, the present study contributes to the literature on imperialism, transnationalism, mobility, ethnicity, and science/knowledge in global and comparative contexts. To be specific, this dissertation investigates how Inner Asian mobile communities, such as Tibetan monks, Mongolian pilgrims, and Ladakhi caravans facilitated Qing understandings of other Eurasian empires, including Tsarist Russia, Ottoman Turkey, Mughal India, Afsharid Iran, and Durrani Afghanistan. Moreover, I argue that Qing information gathering significantly promoted the international integration of information networks and knowledge systems in early modern Eurasia. Finally, this dissertation generalizes historical trends of knowledge exchange to explore the phenomenon of the Qing empire’s knowledge involution caused by political censorship and information non-transparency.

I argue that the commercial expansion and the formation of markets for land, labor, and commodities during China’s early imperial period (221 BCE – 220 CE) can only be understood by considering their origins in the distributive command economy of the late Warring States and imperial Qin. The study focuses on the southern frontier zone of the empire, which is exceptionally well documented in the official and private documents excavated from the Qin and Han sites along the Middle Yangzi and its tributaries. Chapter One “Introduction” outlines historiographical approaches to the study of the relationship between empire-building and economic change, particularly the impact of imperial conquest and extraction on commercial growth. It addresses the importance of frontiers as the sites of economic innovation and change in the ancient empires. I discuss the importance of the recent archaeological discovery of legal and administrative manuscripts from the Warring States (453–221 BCE), Qin (221–206 BCE), and Han (202 BCE – 220 CE) eras for the study of the administrative and economic organization in the early empires. The introduction also outlines the new perspectives on Qin empire-building and economic change made possible by the excavated documentary evidence. Chapter Two “Strategies of conquest and resource extraction in the state and empire of Qin, mid-fourth to late third century BCE” explores the geographical and logistical rationales for the campaigns that brought the Qin armies to the Middle Yangzi and paved the way for further advance to the south of the river. I argue that the Qin developed its fiscal institutions as solutions to the problems of military supply and control over the conquered territories. This system of surplus extraction proved efficient in financing warfare and ensuring the central government’s control over its local agents. However, it faced severe challenges as its operational costs soared in the process of territorial expansion, while the redistributive effects of the fiscal system pitted the principal against the agents. The successes and failings of the Qin model of surplus extraction, and its revision during the subsequent Western Han period profoundly influenced the approaches to economic and territorial management throughout China’s imperial history. Chapter Three “Formation of the imperial frontier: from interaction zone to centralized administration” focuses on the background and the immediate aftermath of the Qin conquest of lands to the south of Middle Yangzi, roughly coinciding with the modern province of Hunan and the southern part of Hubei Province. The chapter examines the longue durée of economic and political integration along the Middle Yangzi from the Late Neolithic period (third millennium BCE) to the dawn of the imperial era. This analysis sheds new light on the background of Qin imperial expansion in this region and the strategies of the “reconstruction of the South” adopted by the Qin emperors and the succeeding Han Empire. I conclude the chapter with detailed analysis of administrative organization and economic management in the Qin county of Qianling in present-day Western Hunan, whose archive was partly recovered during the archaeological excavation of the remains of the Qin town at Liye. Chapter Four “Between command and market: the economy of convict labor” studies the enormous system of unfree labor that incorporated a considerable portion of the Qin Empire’s population and was the key instrument of the Qin command economy. The chapter offers a comparative perspective on the historical regimes of forced labor, which allows identification of economic rationales for such systems and the organizational challenges they faced. It proceeds with an analysis of the legal foundations of penal labor in Qin and the characteristics of the main groups of forced laborers before exploring the organization of the unfree labor economy in Qianling County where detailed data is available concerning the size of the convict population, their economic roles, and the management of their labor. The chapter then discusses changes in the Qin system of unfree labor, its decline after the fall of the Qin Empire, and its impact on the formation of markets for labor in early imperial China. Chapter Five “Conquering distance: transferring goods and people in the Qin Empire” discusses the long-distance transfers of resources, goods, and people. As many other imperial states, the Qin sought to control the physical mobility of its subjects and resources by directing them into desirable channels and restricting unwanted moves. Excavated texts shed light on the previously unknown aspects of the integration of economic and humanitarian space within the empire. Although the imperial connectivity remained fragile and suffered setbacks when the physical and intellectual infrastructures of communication shrank or collapsed with the decline and fall of centralized power, the shared sphere of geographic mobility was essential for the formation of the imperial economy, society, and culture. It tended to regenerate itself after the periods of contraction or disruption and should therefore be considered an important factor in the resilience of centripetal trends in China’s political history. Chapter Six “The state and the private economy” utilizes the materials from Qianling archive to study the relationship between the state and private economies. Although the ideologists of state-strengthening reforms in mid-fourth century BCE Qin cherished the idea that the latter should be completely subsumed under governmental dirigisme, by the times of the Qin Empire, officials recognized the autonomy of private markets and their own inability to substitute for the latter with distributive schemes. In its engagement with private economic actors, the government was guided by considerations of taxation and resource procurement; cost-reduction in the state economy; and maintenance of public order through the delineation of rights and obligations. Transformation of the state economy, its increasing exposure to private markets, and the expansion of the latter, often caused by the state demand for materials and manpower, were powerfully facilitated by the monetization of the frontier region attested in the textual and archaeological evidence. Chapter Seven “Conclusion” summarizes the mutually constitutive relationships between empire-building and economic change in the Qin Empire; traces the development of economic and institutional changes, which become observable during the Qin imperial period, in the subsequent Han era; and formulates some general patterns of the state-economy relationship that may be of use in the comparative study of imperial economic systems.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Economic change, Empire-building, Markets, Qin Empire, Taxation, Territory,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2310000027,"Gerien-Chen, James","Between Empire and Nation: Taiwan Sekimin and the Making of Japanese Empire in South China, 1895–1937",Contemporary,"After the Japanese colonization of Taiwan in 1895, colonial and diplomatic officials sought to encourage, regulate, and surveil the movement of individuals from Taiwan to the south China treaty-ports by conferring upon those who traveled there the legal designation Taiwan sekimin, or “registered Taiwanese.” Japanese officials and sekimin alike fashioned the Taiwan’s inhabitants, their capital, their socio-economic networks, and Taiwan’s colonial institutions as the basis for expanding the Japanese empire’s political and economic influence. This legal status afforded sekimin the extraterritorial protection of local Japanese consulates and subjected them to consular oversight. Over time, the category of Taiwan sekimin was expanded to include local and overseas Chinese whose support Japanese officials sought to garner. This dissertation charts the transformation of Taiwan sekimin as a juridical and social category and argues that it was central to Japanese colonial policy in Taiwan and imperial ambitions in south China. By tracing these changes, this dissertation shows how efforts by Japanese and Chinese officials, as well as by sekimin themselves, drew upon and reshaped the existing social and commercial networks that linked Taiwan to the south China treaty-ports and conditioned Japanese imperial and Chinese imperial and national state formation in south China. Taiwan sekimin ranged from wealthy elites, petty merchants, and doctors and other professionals trained in colonial Taiwan, to young anti-colonial activists drawn to China, criminal elements who formed gangs, and disreputable proprietors of opium and gambling establishments. Diverse though the category was, the status of Taiwan sekimin became, at times, the basis of individuals’ appealing for Japanese consular protection, and at others, the basis of Japanese officials’ laying claim to exercising jurisdiction over individuals considered Japanese subjects. By exploring how Taiwan sekimin individuals both supported and challenged the ideologies and institutions of the Japanese empire at its margins, this dissertation reveals their role in entrenching a Japanese imperial sphere across and beyond the region between 1895 and the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. The legal and spatial bounds of Taiwan sekimin as a juridical and social category were central to intra-imperial and inter-imperial contestations for power in south China. Contention over the Japanese empire’s economic and political ambitions led to contestation over the legal boundaries of Taiwan sekimin between Japanese colonial officials in Taiwan and local consular officials, who sought to regulate the mobility of people, ideas, and capital between Taiwan and the treaty-ports. Over time, Japanese officials also sought to channel the support of sekimin through new institutions. These institutions expanded the spatial scope of jurisdictional contests within and beyond the treaty-ports and thus the scope of imperial power; these institutions also rendered Japanese imperial ambitions more contingent on the support of the sekimin. Chinese local, national, and diplomatic officials also actively challenged the legality of sekimin status and the inclusion of individuals these officials considered Chinese nationals under its purview, particularly after the rise to power of the Chinese Nationalist Party (Guomindang) in the late 1920s. In the 1930s, the concept of Taiwan sekimin was increasingly at odds with Chinese national conceptions of social and economic order. This dissertation shows that, in this context, conflicts involving sekimin were not just local scuffles to be resolved on the interpersonal level but laden with ideological import, leaving the sekimin caught between the logics of empire and nation. This dissertation draws on Japanese- and Chinese-language materials from Japan, Taiwan, and China. It reads official sources “along the grain” to reveal the logic that organized knowledge production about the sekimin and “against the grain” to reconstruct a history largely beyond the purview of bureaucratic institutions. By exploring the competing inter- and intra-imperial claims to authority over Taiwan sekimin, this dissertation argues that jurisdictional contestation had legal and spatial implications in linking Chinese national and Japanese imperial state formation in south China.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,History,History,"Empire and colonialism,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304296027,"Gronewold, Sue Ellen","Encountering hope: The Door of Hope Mission in Shanghai and Taipei, 1900-1976",Contemporary,"This study of the Door of Hope Mission traces its history from its founding in Shanghai, China, in 1900 through its closing there in 1951 and subsequent recreation in Taipei, Taiwan, from 1955-76. Established as a rescue mission for Chinese prostitutes, the Door of Hope quickly evolved into a multi-purpose shelter for women, girls and at times boys who were abandoned, ran away from abuse, were brought by relatives unable or unwilling to care for them, and whom the Mission deemed in need of rescue. The Mission existed in an enclave within an enclave--the semi-colonial world of Shanghai's International Settlement. Its relations with this peculiar Western state within an Asian setting are an integral part of the study, which covers decades in which the state was gradually reclaimed by the Chinese. After exploring the parallel traditions from East and West regarding philanthropy and social welfare, the dissertation situates the Door of Hope within the many worlds of Shanghai that it served: the Western women who controlled, worked at and supported it. the Western men who contributed their expertise. the Chinese male elites who aided and used it for their own purposes. the Chinese women who added their support and labor as helpers. and, lastly, the young women and their families who had their own visions of the uses of this transplanted Anglo-American institution. These alliances shifted over time, and the dissertation traces the major changes that occurred in city and Mission over the course of seven decades. Begun as a broad Sino-Western collaboration, the Mission evolved into an institution dominated by Western evangelicals and Chinese Christians. Yet the setting and the demands of their young charges forced the missionaries to continually renegotiate their views about the Mission's reconstruction of young womanhood. Viewing the Mission as a site for the complex encounter between East and West, the dissertation explores how all those whose paths crossed at the Door of Hope were themselves altered by the experience.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, American history, Religious history, Families & family life, Personal relationships, Sociology, China, Taiwan",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1608998931,"Lawrence, Elizabeth","The Chinese Seal in the Making, 1904-1937",Contemporary,"Seals are hand-held printing blocks inscribed with some pattern, generally text. They were objects of immense power and prestige in imperial China. This dissertation examines the modern afterlife of inscribed seals against the backdrop of the decline and collapse of an imperial era order of knowledge and social status, the rise of modern consumer markets and mass culture, and the local accommodation of modern disciplines that promoted new ways of classifying and engaging the material world. In late imperial China (ca. 1600s-1800s), seals legitimized the rule of the emperor and his civil servants and marked the taste and erudition of the literati elite. As hand-held printing blocks that replicated in ink small textual signs, they produced authorizing marks of personhood and office and attracted elite collectors as calligraphic compositions of antiquarian interest. In modern China, seals proliferated within the cosmopolitan material culture of cities like Hangzhou and Shanghai. As the seal was transformed following the disintegration the imperial system, its multifaceted meanings and functions were increasingly subsumed under a monolithic category of Chinese seal as art object. The making of the Chinese seal as a representative fine art and marker of a distinctive Chinese culture evolved out of the diverse ways in which the carvers, consumers, scholars, and users of seals defined the object's significance in a modern world. This dissertation is thus structured around the new social venues in which the seal emerged in the first four decades of the twentieth century, from the final years of imperial rule through the period of the Nanjing Decade (1927-1937). The seal in premodern China was not an unchanging part of a traditional material culture. Its uses and significance had already undergone dramatic, historically contingent, transformations before the twentieth century. Chapter one broadly examines the multifaceted functions of the seal through Chinese history, and explains the emergence of the seal as an object of literati fascination in the late imperial period. The relationship between seal carving and the literati way of life would have to be at least partially displaced for seal carving to survive China's transition to a more mass-oriented society. Chapter two demonstrates how members of the Xiling Seal Society (founded 1904), the first-ever specialized institution devoted to seal carving and inscriptions celebrated literati values of amateurism and exclusivity while simultaneously contributing to the commodification, public visibility, and transformation of literati seal carving. The Xiling Seal Society, a heritage institution in Hangzhou, had a commercial counterpart in Shanghai. Chapter three uses catalogues of this business and its offshoots as evidence of the crucial role of the market in transmitting and modifying seal carving and related aspects of elite material culture after the collapse of the imperial order. While the Shanghai Xiling Seal Society positioned itself against a vulgarization of seal carving in contemporary society, it incrementally detached the seal from a broader framework of imperial era knowledge production and ultimately marketed it as a customizable commodity. Chapters 4 and 5 examine the emerging categorization of the seal as a fine art object. Through an examination of how-to manuals published during the Republican period, chapter 4 focuses on the ways in which practitioners characterized their expertise and how their practical instruction aimed at a general reader marked a transformation of the concept of amateurism. Chapter 5 looks at the seal's incorporation into state-sponsored national exhibitions of fine art held in 1929 and 1937 and the tensions produced by the collision of connoisseurship culture with the mass pedagogy of aesthetic education. The categorization of seal carving as fine art can be understood as the grafting of an exogenous classification system onto a local practice. But this new categorization did not only transform the seal, it also transformed the very category of fine arts as it was understood in China. The final chapter examines the seal as an object of scholarly inquiry and the relationship between seals, seal carving, and an indigenous field of metal and stone inscription study ( jinshi ). The second director of the Xiling Seal Society, a scholar named Ma Heng, incorporated seals into his vision of metal and stone inscription study as a sub-discipline of modern historical scholarship. Ma Heng judged seal carving by the integrity of the archaic text as an accurately rendered play upon epigraphic models. His insistence that seal carving be understood as an expression of scholarship serves as a reminder of how awkwardly imperial era practices of connoisseurship and knowledge production mapped onto a modern field of disciplines. As examined in the epilogue, the People's Republic of China has succeeded in having the art of Chinese seal engraving inscribed on the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage of humanity.

304500119,"Stevenson, Miwha Lee",Webs of signification: Representation as social transformation in the muraled tombs of Koguryo,Ancient,"When archaeology was introduced to East Asia at the beginning of the twentieth century, among the first sites to be explored were two large concentrations of tombs and ruins located, respectively, in the vicinity of P'yongyang (North Korea) and the Manchurian town of Fan (Jilin Province, China). The remains were from the outset identified as those of the capitals of the state of Koguryo, mentioned in dynastic records. Of the various tomb-types subsequently excavated at these two sites, stone-chambered tombs bearing polychrome murals have attracted particular attention for their distinctive construction and rich pictorial content. Dubbed “the muraled tombs of Koguryo”, scholars have equated this burial-form with elites of the state of Koguryo and looked to their murals as a means to reconstruct the social and cultural forces at work in this seminal, yet controversial, period of early Korean history. This dissertation addresses two main concerns: One is to review prevailing interpretations of the Koguryo muraled tombs and to offer a critical appraisal of the methodological assumptions and issues that have shaped the idea of the muraled tombs as an historical topos. The second is to attempt to move away from the ramified formalism of traditional stylistic and iconographic analysis and seek to situate the muraled tombs as a symbolic assemblage that was deployed for communicative effect within a historically specific milieu of social and cultural practice. These concerns are pursued through close study of Anak Tomb no. 3 and the Tomb of Zhen/Chin at Tokhungri—two muraled tomb sites that are unique in the fact that they contain inscriptional records of the circumstances and dates of their construction (357 and 409 A.D., respectively). The representational parameters and function of muraled tomb and epigraph are established through broad study of these practices among contemporaneous continental Chinese and regional Northeast Asian elites. Their adoption at fourth century P'yongyang and Ji'an sites is shown to be connected with shifts in symbolic strategy that accompanied the emergence of a new local elite and the generation of a new discursive presence of “Koguryo.”",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, Art History, Archaeology, China, Koguryo, Korea, Murals, Signification, Social transformation, Tombs",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
230986017,"Wang, Min-Ying","The historicization of Chinese architecture: The making of architectural historiography in China, from the late nineteenth century to 1953",Contemporary,"The Confucian metaphysical philosophy devalued material artifacts. As a result, architecture was not traditionally seen as a scholarly field. Architectural study as a formal academic discipline began only in the last decades of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) when it was introduced as a field of study by Westerners. Since then, Chinese scholars have produced a significant body of architectural history that has helped shape the way that Chinese people think of architecture. The objective of this analytical study is to provide a history of the writings of the most important architectural historians who worked during the first stage of the discipline's development in China from both within China and abroad. Noting that the belated modernization was an unspoken factor that influenced all of these architectural histories, this dissertation examines the existing architectural texts with a specific interest in the nationalistic ideology underpinning their interpretations of architectural images both traditional and modern. Five groups of architectural historians who were involved in the formation of this discipline are examined. They are (1) Western Sinologists, including John Calvin Ferguson (1866–1945), Walter Perceval Yetts (1878–1957), Osvald Sirén (1879–1966), Carroll Brown Malone (1886–1973), Paul Demiéville (1894–1979), and Gustav Ecke (1896–1971), among others. (2) progressive Chinese intellectuals such as Yue Jiazao (1868–1944), Zhu Qiqian (1872–1964) and the fellows of the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture (1930–1945). (3) culturally conservative architectural professionals trained abroad, represented by Liang Sicheng (1901–1972) and Lin Huiyin (1904–1955). (4) architectural modernists, of whom, the most insightful was probably Tong Jun (1900–1983). and (5) socialist writers Hu Man (1904–1986) and Feng Zikai (1898–1975). The Chinese historians listed above exemplified a confident local response to foreign input. They interwove Confucian collectivism with Western architectural history to fulfill the need for a national identity caused by the asynchronous modernization. This is particularly embodied in the methodologies and historical styles that they remodeled.

304692160,"Field, Andrew David","A night in Shanghai: Nightlife and modernity in semicolonial China, 1919–1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the influence of nightlife and related mass culture phenomena such as jazz music and social dancing on Chinese politics and social life in the city of Shanghai between the two world wars. In the early twentieth century, the Victorian Age formalism of the ball and tea dance dominated the leisure culture of Westerners in Shanghai, while Chinese nightlife consisted of age-old establishments such as brothels, teahouses, and opera houses. Following the Great War, informal establishments such as cafes, night clubs, and dance halls catering to Westerners arose in the city's settlements. In the late 1920s, Chinese artists, intellectuals, and entrepreneurs introduced native elements into the foreign culture of the cabaret. The Chinese dance hostess (wunu) became a popular profession and an icon of feminine modernity, pioneering patterns of leisure, consumption, fashionability, and social mobility. Under severe economic and political pressures resulting from the onset of the world depression in 1931 and the Zhabei war in 1932, previously exclusive cabarets and ballrooms opened their doors to the Chinese masses. As dance halls gained in size, popularity, and number, they became the stomping grounds for an increasingly diverse set of patrons drawn from the city's native elite and petty bourgeois population. Despite efforts at regulation by municipal authorities, the infiltration of gangsters, prostitutes, nude reviews, and other “low life” elements contributed to their general degradation in the public mind, while social campaigns portrayed cabarets as dissolute spaces that corrupted urban youth. The cabaret was also an important space for imagining modernity in Chinese literature. Popular and avant-garde writers such as Bao Tianxiao and Mu Shiying incorporated cabarets into their narratives of the modern city, perceiving them as spaces that initiated people into the sophisticated pleasures and dangers of life in the semicolonial city.

858861710,"LaCouture, Elizabeth","Modern Homes for Modern Families in Tianjin, China, 1860–1949",Contemporary,"This dissertation writes the history of the home into the history of modern China. Focusing on the Chinese concept of jiating , which integrates family, house, and home, this dissertation examines how the urban home became the center of individual identity for a growing group of Chinese cosmopolitans in treaty-port Tianjin in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As urban populations surged, and the home increasingly became a site of consumption, reformers, architects, municipal governments, and urban residents all began to formulate new ideas about family, housing, and home. This dissertation looks at discussions on family reform alongside family population statistics, architectural evidence, and the material culture of everyday life in Tianjin, a city where nine foreign countries established extra-territorial concessions alongside a Chinese city. Concentrating on life at home, this dissertation argues that changes in everyday life were just as significant as reformers' public calls to change the Chinese family to save the nation when it came to forging the new cosmopolitans' concepts of gender, ethnicity, and status. In fact, new evidence on family size from Tianjin archives suggests that the family as practiced did not always reflect the family of nationalist ideology. In the end, between reformist rhetoric, popular print culture ideals, and the concrete conditions of urban life, modern Chinese families formed their own identities and created their own spaces — making their homes and families modern.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, Architecture, China, Home, Tianjin, Urban families, Women",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1752116904,"Wu, Lan",Refuge from Empire: Religion and Qing China's Imperial Formation in the Eighteenth Century,Modern,"Following several successful military expeditions against the Mongols in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Manchu rulers of Qing China (1644-1911) met an unprecedented challenge as they incorporated culturally different subjects into their growing empire. After doubling in territory and tripling in population, how did the multicultural Qing operate? How did the new imperial subjects receive and reinterpret Qing state policies? What have been the ramifications of the eighteenth-century political innovations in modern China? In this dissertation, I address these questions by examining the encounters of the expanding Qing empire with Tibetans and Mongols in Inner Asia. Central to the analysis is Tibetan Buddhism, to which Mongols and Tibetans have adhered for centuries. Recent decades have seen a growing volume of research attending to Tibetan Buddhism within the context of the Qing’s imperial policies, but key questions still remain with regards to the perspective of these Inner Asian communities and the reasons for their participation in the imperial enterprise. The inadequate understanding of the Qing’s interaction with Tibetan Buddhism is predicated upon the assumption that Qing emperors propitiated the belligerent Mongols by patronizing their religion. While this premise acknowledges Tibetan Buddhism’s importance in the Qing’s imperial formation, it simultaneously deprives those practicing the religion of agency. The purpose of this dissertation is to analyze how the empire was ruled from the viewpoint of the governed. The project draws evidence from Tibetan-language biographies and monastic chronicles, letters in the Mongolian language, as well as local gazetteers, artisanal manuals, and court statutes in Chinese and Manchu, the two official languages in the Qing era. These textual sources are supplemented by Tibetan Buddhist artifacts housed in museums and libraries in North America and Asia. Through an examination of the wide array of source materials, I argue that the Qing imperial rulers capitalized on the religious culture of Inner Asian communities, which in turn gave rise to a transnational religious network that was centered on Tibetan Buddhist epistemology. The religious knowledge system remained strong well past the formative eighteenth century. Its enduring impact on Qing political and social history was felt even as the empire worked towards creating a distinctive cosmopolitan Qing culture. The dissertation consists of four chapters, each of which locates a space within the context of the symbiotic growth of the Qing and the Tibetan Buddhist knowledge network. This dissertation revolves around Tibetan Buddhist scholars, institutions, rituals, and objects, as they traveled from Tibet to Qing China’s capital and eastern Mongolia, and finally entered the literary realm of intellectuals in eighteenth-century China. Chapter One brings into focus Tibetan Buddhist reincarnation—a dynamic practice that redefined the institutional genealogy of individual prestige—as the Qing imperial power increased its contact with Inner Asian communities from the 1720s in the strategic border region of Amdo between Tibet and Qing China. I discuss how local hereditary headmen refashioned themselves into religious leaders whose enduring influence could transcend even death so as to preserve their prestige. Yet, their impact reached beyond the imperial margin. Chapter Two traces the role of these religious leaders in transforming an imperial private space into the largest Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the Qing’s imperial capital. This monastery—Beijing’s Lama Temple (Yonghegong [special characters omitted])—not only became a site that manifested Qing imperial devotion to Tibetan Buddhism, but also served as an institutional outpost for the increasingly transnational Tibetan Buddhist network to the east. The Lama Temple was not the only outpost of the growing religious network, and Chapter Three explores another major nodal point within this network at a contact zone in southern Mongolia. It was here that two massive Tibetan Buddhist monasteries were constructed, owing to the mutual efforts undertaken by the imperial household and Tibetan Buddhists from Inner Asia. The final chapter returns to the imperial center but shifts its focus to a discursive space formed by Tibetan Buddhist laity who also occupied official posts in the imperial court. Two Manchu princes and one Mongolian Buddhist composed or were commissioned to compile texts in multiple languages on Tibetan Buddhist epistemology. Their writings reveal the fluidity and extent of the religious network, as well as its symbiotic growth with the imperial enterprise as the Qing empire took shape territorially and culturally. This dissertation concludes by addressing the nature of the Qing’s governance and that of the transnational power of the Tibetan Buddhist network, and it aims to deconstruct the dominant discourse associated with imperial policies in the Inner Asian frontier. My findings offer insight into how Tibetan Buddhism had a lasting impact on the Qing’s imperial imagination, during and after the formative eighteenth century.",2016,2016,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"History, Asian Studies, China, Eighteenth century, Growing empire, Multicultural, Qing China's imperial formation, Religion",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1435629923,"Chen, BuYun",Dressing for the Times: Fashion in Tang Dynasty China (618–907),Medieval,"During the Tang dynasty, an increased capacity for change created a new value system predicated on the accumulation of wealth and the obsolescence of things that is best understood as fashion. Increased wealth among Tang elites was paralleled by a greater investment in clothes, which imbued clothes with new meaning. Intellectuals, who viewed heightened commercial activity and social mobility as symptomatic of an unstable society, found such profound changes in the vestimentary landscape unsettling. For them, a range of troubling developments, including crisis in the central government, deep suspicion of the newly empowered military and professional class, and anxiety about waste and obsolescence were all subsumed under the trope of fashionable dressing. The clamor of these intellectuals about the widespread desire to be current reveals the significant space fashion inhabited in the empire—a space that was repeatedly gendered female. This dissertation considers fashion as a system of social practices that is governed by material relations—a system that is also embroiled in the politics of the gendered self and the body. I demonstrate that this notion of fashion is the best way to understand the process through which competition for status and self-identification among elites gradually broke away from the imperial court and its system of official ranks. Out of status instability grew a desire for novelty that transformed the dressed body into an object for status display during the late eighth and ninth centuries. Sartorial savvy became a critical arena for the articulation of wealth and power by the old aristocracy and new military or professional elite alike. A foundational aim of my dissertation is to understand how fashion contributed to a new system for ordering the world in Tang dynasty China. By the ninth century, changes in the Tang economic and political structure enabled the rise of a new fashionable elite whose politics of appearance were driven more by the luxury silk economy than by the old symbolic order. I argue that the emergence of fashion was intimately related to developments in the silk industry, which not only reached record production levels during this period, but also manufactured fabrics that were unprecedented in design and complexity. The rise of private silk workshops in the latter half of the dynasty made silk more available to the new military and professional elites. As consumers of novel silks, these elites propelled the silk industry forward and with it, fashion. The new silk economy was personified in a popular literary trope of the ninth century: the impoverished weaving girl slaving away in the silk workshops as an icon of the damages engendered by the excessive consumption of luxury. With this project, I illustrate how the history of Tang fashion serves as an important prism into the workings of the Tang state, the productive lives of premodern women, and the formation of social and cultural identities during a dynamic period of world history. My approach is interdisciplinary, informed by economic history, art history, literature, and textile technology. To my analysis of Tang poetry, sumptuary laws, and economic treatises, I add careful examination of the visual representations of dress and a close study of the corpus of silk artifacts to map the transformations in sartorial practice. By the end of the dynasty, fashion had become a key part of a larger critique of the waning empire's economic landscape, the rise of a new military and professional elite, and the collapse of stable status displays. Involved in a nascent market system, tied to the building of new hierarchies, and implicated in structures of gender and cultural identity, the Tang fashion system was integral to these larger historical processes.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"History, Asian Studies, China, Fashion, Tang dynasty, Textiles, Women",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1667460635,"Van Vleet, Stacey A.","Medicine, Monasteries and Empire: Tibetan Buddhism and the Politics of Learning in Qing China",Modern,"Representing the first comprehensive study of Tibetan medical institutions, this dissertation argues that medicine played a crucial role in the development of Tibetan Buddhism outside of Tibet during the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), while Tibetan Buddhism played a vital role in the governance of the northern and western borderlands of the Qing Empire. During the same period remembered today for the rise of science along mercantile-colonialist sea routes, an inland network of Tibetan Buddhist monastic medical colleges ( gso rig or sman pa grwa tshang ) proliferated in tandem with the expansion of the Qing Empire over Inner Asia. My study examines these developments from a regional rather than an anachronistic nation-state perspective, historicizing both the Tibetan medical system and its community of practitioners within the context of Qing imperial expansion and decline. Combining the approaches of intellectual and institutional history, I argue that the medical colleges of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries bridged the realms of ritual and materiality that we understand as separate today, providing a key site for the display of benevolent governance, and serving as a vital forum for intellectual and material exchange between the Qing court and peoples of the Tibetan Buddhist frontiers. The monastic guidelines ( bca' yig ) of Tibetan medical colleges provide a window into these institutions' ritual and medical curricula, as well as debates over medical orthodoxy that took place within and between them. Historical narratives within monastic guidelines served as frameworks of legitimacy and templates for ritual practice, and the boundaries of medicine as a discipline were negotiated through the selective incorporation of various medical lineages and traditions. I explore the relationship between ritual debates, doctrinal debates, and ideas about how to both encourage and circumscribe experience within the monastic guidelines of medical colleges. One of the major issues at stake was the relationship between innovation and revelation, as physicians could claim a special insight into the experience of their predecessors in a medical lineage. While innovation was necessary for expertise in healing, revelation was potentially dangerous to the state. Such medical debates give us insight into ideas about the relationship between social and epistemic order taught within Tibetan Buddhist institutions as they spread within the Qing Empire. With the advent of new ways of defining territorial and disciplinary boundaries in the early twentieth century, ritual technologies for defining social and epistemic order were replaced by new institutional structures. I consider why the greater circulation of medical knowledge within the Qing Empire was followed by a fragmentation of medical nationalisms. While Han Chinese nationalists embraced the culture of science as a defensive strategy against Western powers and as a political strategy to distance themselves from the Qing formation, Tibetan Buddhists did not seek such a radical break. Similar and connected medical reforms in Lhasa, Eastern Tibet, Mongolia, and Buryatia reveal the continuity of Tibetan Buddhist knowledge networks and early cooperation among their separate nationalist projects. In the broader context of the history of science, the example of Tibetan Buddhist medical institutions points to the centrality of early modern networks of knowledge in determining modern political configurations.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"History, Asian Studies, Science history, Buddhism, China, Medicine, Mongolia, Qing dynasty, Tibet",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

I argue that political engagement was not only unavoidable during the formative years of building the Bank of China, but could be beneficial to the bank's development. As the officially designated central bank from 1912 to 1928, the bank had little alternative to participate in the turbulent politics of early Republican China. This participation was, however, not always as unwilling as the bankers themselves later claimed. Behind the rhetoric of reform that they skillfully employed in the popular press of the day to contest government encroachment and to campaign for shareholder rights—rhetoric that has perpetuated a narrative that valorizes the separation of the Bank of China from politics—the bank's officials and shareholders became adept at using national political events and political alliances to mobilize support for their reformist objectives. Reform was thus inextricably connected with contestations of power. In this often messy process, the Chinese modern bankers laid the foundations for what became the republic's premier banking institution and devised ways to create a mature banking sector despite the lack of consistent governmental policies, a regulatory framework, and effective enforcement.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, Banking, Bank of China, China, Politics, Reform, Republican period, Shareholders",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304027767,"Neskar, Ellen G.",The cult of worthies: A study of shrines honoring local Confucian worthies in the Sung Dynasty (960-1279),Medieval,"This thesis examines the dramatic spread of local shrines honoring recently deceased, exemplary men. Founded in government and private schools and Buddhist monasteries, they were distinct from ancestral temples and the state-sponsored Temples to Confucius and represent a new level of communal and individual religion in Confucianism. Worthies' shrines had no place in the classical Confucian tradition. To legitimize them, Sung Confucians reinterpreted canonical ritual texts and established informal criteria for enshrinement. This thesis argues that changes in these criteria and in the qualities that defined worthies reflect the changing goals and self-conceptions of the Sung elite. As the elite turned its attention from national government to local society, retired literati known for their local activities replaced nationally renowned military heroes and court officials in the shrines. Beginning in the late eleventh century successive elite groups, critical of the government, appropriated the shrines to disseminate their own political views. The shrines soon honored the persecuted members of these groups and became an institutional expression of Confucian martyrology. Up to the thirteenth century, one criterion of enshrinement was a connection between the worthy and the location of his shrine. When the Learning of the Way (Tao-hsueh) movement of Neo-Confucian adopted the local shrines as its own, it broke with this criterion and developed an empire-wide network of shrines honoring five of its founders as national, not local, worthies who had succeeded to the transmission of the true Confucian Way (tao-t'ung). By 1241, the success of this movement convinced the emperor to enshrine these five men in the imperial Temple to Confucius, the symbolic locus of state orthodoxy. The court thus signalled its acceptance of a Neo-Confucian ideology that had long been established in local elite society. This work examines 115 years of court debates leading to this momentous decision, which we now see as the first step in the rise of the state orthodoxy that would last until 1905.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, China",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

Political theorists and practitioners employed distinctive vocabularies to delineate the legitimate boundaries of the political community, as did official historians long after the fact. In Chapter Two, I reveal how the official historiography of the factional conflict was severely compromised by Northern and Southern Song court politics. Official historiography provided a retroactive means of pronouncing or denying the political legitimacy of a ministerial regime. These official histories articulated a political and ideological agenda. their compilers incorporated source materials that suited their interpretation of history, and excluded those which did not. In Chapter Three, I investigate the textual history of a major historical source, the “Treacherous Minister” biographies of the Song History . The court historiographers of the Yuan dynasty worked by reproducing and assembling fragments of foundation texts to intensify their condemnatory portrayal of biographical subjects. They constructed a narrative representation of the factional conflict that suppressed political and ideological ambiguity, creating villains for posterity. In Chapter Four, I examine the historical and intellectual evolution of the term “faction,” as it functioned in Northern Song political theory. Manipulating classical and historical discourse, political theorists bifurcated the political community into ethical and unethical political practitioners. By engaging in a close reading of Northern Song “Essays on Faction,” I demonstrate the intellectual context that influenced theorists' efforts to delineate the boundaries of legitimate politics. In Chapter Five, I scrutinize the language of Northern Song politics, which constructed ethical oppositions between political allies and adversaries. By reading a sample of political language drawn from the various phases of the factional conflict, I illustrate that political rhetoric was a shared language, even as political practices escalated in brutality. Analyzing both historical and political discourse and practice, I illuminate the linkages between the politics of history and the culture of politics to provide a new perspective on factionalism.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, China, Factionalism, Language, Politics, Song dynasty",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304687644,"Khu, Josephine Meihui Tiampo","The making of a frontier: The Qing military in Taiwan, 1684–1783",Modern,"This dissertation focuses on the issues surrounding the stationing of military forces on Taiwan after the Qing state annexed it in 1684, the measures put in place to control the island's officers and troops, and the mechanics of their financing and maintenance. The aim of this dissertation is twofold: to shed light on the process of Han Chinese migration to frontier areas of the empire (a notable development in the eighteenth century), and to contribute to an understanding of the processes of state expansion and control in late imperial China. Aspects of the following intriguing questions are discussed and analyzed: Why did inhabitants from southern coastal Fujian, a heavily populated area from at least the twelfth century and dependent on grain imports, not migrate to a fertile island lying only about 150 kilometers away until the seventeenth century? Why had the Chinese state, heavily reliant on agricultural taxes for its revenues, not actively sought to populate this territory with agricultural settlers and to administer it? Why, when the island was finally incorporated into the Chinese empire in the late seventeenth century, did Qing rulers institute a policy of partial quarantine on the island? And why, despite the quarantine policy, did Han Chinese settlement of Taiwan increase to unprecedented levels? Several conclusions are reached in this dissertation. First, the increasing commercialization of the Ming-Qing period complicated the state's ability to control its maritime frontier. Understanding the nature and cause of these complications is essential to understanding the rationale behind Qing policies on Taiwan. Second, even in the case of a territory situated in close proximity to a highly commercialized region, the state played a crucial role in initiating Han Chinese agricultural settlement to that territory. Finally, the state, in stationing its troops in a frontier area, likewise played a large role in continuing to create the conditions favorable for Chinese immigration to that area, and helped to shape the sub-ethnic composition of the frontier population.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, China, Frontier, Migration, Military, Qing dynasty, Taiwan",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

It is an attempt to integrate intellectual history and social history more closely, to respond to the questions social historians raise while not forsaking the study of ideas. This dissertation attempts to reconstruct the magnitude of Hedong School's influence in the Ming. and to understand Xue Xuan in his own right. This is achieved in part by studying two central themes of Xue's philosophy: the central issue for Neo-Confucians, the Transmission of the Way. and Xue's philosophical trademark, Restoring Nature. These two themes also help us to understand Xue's attitude towards the teacher-student relation or intellectual lineage, and provide us with part of the background to comprehend his stand towards government schools. His stand on both areas stands in sharp contrast to his southern counterparts. Xue's tendency to locate the state in the center of social and political life is also visible in the way he understood kinship organization. Comparing Xue's ideas on kinship organization to that of his southern counterparts, we see that local concerns, and especially local leadership and positive influences on local societies, are apparently missing in Xue's. Our study of Xue Xuan's clan also reveals that the way it practiced kinship was different from clans of the south. yet not similar either to the model thought to be more dominant in north China by anthropologists, at least not during the Ming. Xue Xuan's importance in Ming intellectual history also rests in the fact that he was the first Ming Neo-Confucian to be enshrined in the Temple to Confucius in the Ming. This dissertation also studies the century long process of the effort to enshrine him. From it, we see how supporters claimed to represent public opinion, and how a new paradigm was formed for the evaluation of Confucians for this honor. We also see how members from the rivaling Wang Yangming School initially supported the effort from their own agenda. Eventually, an interesting mix of factors based on political alliances, philosophical positions, regional pride, and family histories finally succeeded in placing Xue's tablet in the Temple.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, China, Hedong School, Intellectual history, Ming dynasty, Neo-Confucianism, Xue Xuan",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

Before May Fourth 1919, “Beida” and “Beida students” did not exist as stable positions to be occupied but were instead both produced because of and through the practices and the struggles of those years. The premise here is that an understanding of the emergence of student activism can be achieved only if we consider how it challenged the distinctions between the cultural and the political, the intellectual and the quotidian. Political expression during the May Fourth years was located and took shape in different aspects of the realm of students' lived practice in and around Beida: in the daily life in classrooms and dorms, in the reformed curriculum and teaching routines, in the evolving relationship with the city and its people, and finally in allegedly “cultural” student organizations.

It was basically an institution of control which enabled the colonial government to secure control over the island. After the turn of the century, the system developed into an informal organization of local government. it was on this level of local administration that office-holders were preponderantly Taiwanese. Without purporting to be a comprehensive analysis of the hoko system, this study stresses the functional organization, developmental structure, and operational mobilization of this system under the Japanese. I started this study by looking at the system as a political institution. By political institution, I mean that the hoko system was in essence a political mechanism for social control. It had a unique structure and organization. From a control system in the employ of the police, it evolved during peacetime into an administrative base for local governments. It was further used, after 1932, as a vehicle for Japan's wartime mobilization. I conclude, however, that the hoko system should be treated not only as a political institution, but also as a social organization. As a social organization, the hoko functioned largely within a moral society. the organization relied heavily on the mediating role of a local elite, which shared a set of values based on acknowledged status and established trust with the rest of society. As such, the system worked less for social reform than for social control and mobilization. This study is an attempt to provide a basis for future examinations and comparisons of Chinese pao-chia system. In a synchronic approach, I would argue that the hoko system, though conceived as a continuation of a historical reality, generated significant changes by its very implemention. The success story of this system under the Japanese was made possible by a lucky convergence of historical factors. Its experience may not have been repeated elsewhere, because of the unique timing of implementation, the nature of colonial rule, and the manageability of scale.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, History, China",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

In religion, reformers saw laudable systems of ethics degraded by wasteful and unseemly popular practices, and institutions whose influence threatened to impede government control. Thus party and government officials sought to translate a nebulous distinction between acceptable beliefs and harmful superstition into executable ways to regulate religious groups and control practitioners. Meanwhile, by confiscating temple property and attempting to substitute civic rituals for old-style customs, the regime sought to reorder the pattern of power in local society, sometimes to great resistance. This project aims to trace the story of Nationalist policy towards Chinese popular religion and then place it in the context of local history, employing case studies from the capital and Jiangsu province. The result is not simply a case of an “urban intellectual” government seeking to repress a clear-cut set of “traditional” cultural practices.

304039143,"Young, Louise Conrad","Mobilizing for empire: Japan and Manchukuo, 1931--1945",Contemporary,"With the military occupation that began in 1931, the provinces of northeast China, or Manchuria, were transformed from a sphere of influence into the puppet state of Manchukuo. The building of Manchukuo was a tremendous undertaking, involving ongoing military campaigns to crush native resistance, elaborate development plans to integrate the Japanese and Manchurian economies and create a self-sufficient productive sphere, and a grandiose immigration scheme, projecting the transportation of five million Japanese farmers to the Manchurian frontier. These three efforts--military conquest, economic development, and frontier settlement--brought hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers, entrepreneurs, and agricultural immigrants to northeast China in the space of a few years, while at home many times their number labored to build the empire in indirect though no less essential ways. This study looks at the mobilization of domestic society for empire, the war fever that rallied people around the defense of the Manchurian lifeline, the economic boom that convinced businessmen to underwrite Manchurian development, and the immigration fever that impelled farmers to abandon their homeland for a Manchurian paradise. For all the changes wrought on the Manchurian landscape, imperialism entailed a corresponding transformation at home. The standard picture of Manchukuo shows Japan's imperial army running amok, while powerless politicians, unwelcome industrialists and exploited citizens looked on helplessly. Yet it clearly took more than generals and jackboots to make an empire. Thus my work centers on the role played by civil society in the imperial task. Whether it was media promotion of the military hard-line, activities of business organizations to advance corporate interests in Manchukuo, or the enthusiasm of village leadership for the emigration project, civil organizations and private citizens became self-appointed imperial advocates.

In general, scholars of international affairs have concentrated on state-to-state relations and diplomatic history. Two comprehensive problems emerge here. First, while the roles of national perceptions in influencing international relations have received theoretical attention, their more practical manifestations remain largely unexamined. Secondly, bilateral relationships have of ten been defined—too narrowly—in terms of the state alone. Although states have played a crucial role in shaping the institutional framework of international relations, the actual course of relations between states is of ten determined by each nation's perceptions of the other, collectively constructed and maintained within the particular society. These two factors—the official relations pursued by the state, and the perceptions held by society—crucially shaped, in particular, Sino-Japanese-American relations during the Allied Occupation period. Because popular images in Japan, China and America with regard to each other were by no means monolithic, understanding their range and complexity is essential. Toward this objective, the issues examined include the formulation of wartime and postwar U.S. policy toward China, Japanese and Chinese reactions to Japan's defeat in World War II, Japanese residents in China and their repatriation, Japanese reparations, Japanese economic reconstruction and Sino-Japanese trade, and Japan's peace treaty with China.

304862693,"Chen, Li","Law and sensibility of empire in the making of modern China, 1750–1900",Contemporary,"This dissertation studies how modern Western knowledge of Chinese law and society was discursively constructed, strategically circulated, and politically deployed from 1750 through 1900. Moreover, it explores how law and sensibility provided the ideological anchorage and epistemological guidance for British (as well as other Western) imperialism in relation to China during this period. By reexamining the different but related archival, intellectual, popular, and official discourses in this regard, this study historicizes and interrogates the complex dynamics of the intersections between power and knowledge, imperialism and culture, law and sentiments, and identity and international politics. This project challenges some of the centuries-old received wisdom about late imperial Chinese law, politics, and diplomacy, and about the origins of modern Sino-British/Western conflicts. It argues that law and sensibility essentially rationalized and structured British/Western imperialism in the nineteenth century. The inadequate or uncritical attention to these discourses in traditional historiography has caused serious misinterpretations of the two Opium Wars (1839–42, 1856–60) and of the trajectories of Sino-Western relations and Chinese modernity. On the one hand, by constantly reactivating the global spectacle of Chinese (legal) “despotism,” “cruelty,” and “barbarism,” these discourses provided the much-needed moral authority and political justification for Western subjugation of China in the name of the “civilizing mission” and “universal humanity.” On the other hand, they allowed Western powers to establish the institutional infrastructure for their domination through extraterritoriality and unequal treaties in the name of “human rights,” “the rule of law,” and “modern diplomacy.” Simultaneously, these Western discourses of law and sensibility have also profoundly influenced China's efforts to “modernize” its political and legal systems as well as culture and society since the late nineteenth century.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, Law, China, Chinese history, Cultural imperialism, Empire, Law, Law and empire, Sino-Western relations, Sovereignty",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1681636001,"Boyanton, Stephen","The Treatise on Cold Damage and the Formation of Literati Medicine: Social, Epidemiological, and Medical Change in China, 1000–1400",Medieval,"This dissertation explores the profound changes that occurred in literate Chinese medicine during the Song (960–1279), Jin (1115–1234), and Yuan (1276–1368) dynasties—changes which established the pattern of the text-based Chinese medical tradition from that time to the present day. In particular it examines the transformation of the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) text, the Treatise on Cold Damage ( Shanghan lun [special characters omitted]), from one member of a diverse tradition of texts giving instruction on the treatment of cold damage disorders ( shanghan [special characters omitted], a class of potentially epidemic, febrile illnesses) into the preeminent—almost the only—canonical text about such illnesses and a touchstone for medical thinking on all types of illnesses. I argue that a two primary factors account for the Treatise ’s remarkable rise in status: the rise in the frequency of epidemics caused by Chinese society’s crossing of epidemiological frontiers, both in terms of population and in terms of geographic distribution, and a crisis of trust in medicine which was part of a much broader epistemic crisis brought about by the radical changes in social structure, commerce, governance, and material culture during the Song. The increase in epidemics gave added weight to the topic of cold damage, but the decisive factors singling out the Treatise were related to its usefulness in addressing the medical crisis of trust. Medical authors were unanimous in their condemnation of the status quo in medicine. The focus of their criticisms was the figure of the common physician ( shiyi [special characters omitted]). Common physicians, the dominant practitioners of text-based medicine in the Northern Song, belonged to social stratum just below that of the elite. For elite medical authors, common physicians were the primary problem with medicine: they were inadequately or incorrectly educated, failed to appreciate the complexity of illness, and lacked elite ethical values. While elite authors agreed that common physicians were the problem, they disagreed on how to resolve this problem. Three approaches developed a more elite form medicine—which I term “literati medicine.” It was among the proponents of one of these approaches—“literati-physician medicine,” which held that only members of the elite could be proper physicians—that the Treatise on Cold Damage became central to medical thought and practice. Literati physicians found the Treatise useful for a variety of reasons. In terms of their social relations, both within the clinical encounter and in broader society, it was a useful tool for arguing for their own superiority over their common physician competitors. In terms of their clinical doctrines, it provided a model by which to deal with what they saw as the central problem in medicine: the protean nature of illness. As long as that remained the central problematic of their medical tradition, the Treatise retained its central place. By the Yuan, literati physicians dominated all of literati medicine and ultimately all of textually based medicine, making the Treatise a central text for all physicians. The history of the Treatise ’s transformation into one of the most fundamental texts of the Chinese medical tradition is therefore rooted in the formation of literati medicine, and its struggle for both social legitimacy and clinical efficacy. The Treatise ’s continued importance from the Yuan to modern times is the result of the survival of literati medicine for nearly one thousand years. In spite of many changes, modern Chinese medicine remains committed to a vision of illness as irreducibly complex and to an approach to cure—individualization of treatments—first learned from the Treatise on Cold Damage during the Song dynasty.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"History, Medicine, Science history, China, Chinese medicine, Literati, Literati medicine, Shanghan lun, Social change, Song dynasty, Treatise on Cold Damage",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

Employing county-level archival materials, it argues that during the immediate post-Liberation period, Party leaders implicitly understood both the administrative and epistemological obstacles to transforming a vast multiethnic empire into a unitary, socialist nation-state. For much of the 1950s it therefore employed a subimperial strategy, referred to as the United Front, as a means to gradually and voluntarily bridge the gap between empire and nation. However, the United Front ultimately lost out to a revolutionary impatience that demanded immediate national integration and socialist transformation, leading in 1958 to communization, democratic reforms and rebellion. Despite successfully identifying the tensions between empire and nation, and attempting to creatively resolve them, empire was eliminated before the process of de-imperialization and nationalization was completed. This failure occurred at both the level of policy and narrative, leaving Amdo's Tibetan population unevenly absorbed into the modern Chinese nation-state.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,History,History,"History, Modern history, Political science, Social structure, Amdo rebellion, China, Huangnan prefecture, Pastoral collectivization, Qinghai, Tibet, Zeku (Tsekhok) county",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304379535,"Harris, Kristine Marie",Silent speech: Envisioning the nation in early Shanghai cinema,Contemporary,"This dissertation traces the development of cinema in China between 1896 and 1937, with special attention to the active role Shanghai filmmakers played in constructing a discourse of the modern nation. Close study of long-neglected historical sources and detailed analysis of rare extant narrative films--such as the 1927 adaptation of the classic Romance of the Western Chamber and the late silent New Woman of 1935--reveal the process by which cinema became established as a new field of cultural production in early twentieth-century China. Political, economic, artistic, and social concerns, including classical dramatic forms, the evolving technology, and the representation of women, are all examined as prominent factors shaping the exhibition and production of silent and early sound film in China. Careful consideration is given to the local and global contexts for Shanghai cinema, from the first imports in 1896 through the imminent war with Japan and the dispersal of film production companies by 1937. Local filmmaking practices are discussed in relation to trends in Chinese literature and theater, and concurrent developments in the cinemas of Europe, the United States, and Japan. We find that as filmmakers sought to create a national cinema that was distinct from, yet competitive with, Hollywood imports, they vigorously experimented with diverse ways of making film speak to local audiences. Even as this variety of voices and visions was muted by 1920s and 1930s state and political party attempts to unify the nation through censorship and anti-imperialism, Shanghai cinema managed, nonetheless, to accomodate a powerful element of dissent in the form of silent speech.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, Motion Pictures, Asian literature, China, women characters",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304592505,"Kang, Xiaofei",Power on the margins: The cult of the fox in late imperial China,Modern,"The dissertation combines the disciplines of Chinese religious, literary and cultural history to examine the relationship between local cult practices and power in late imperial society. It studies the fox cult, which was regarded as an “illicit” cult by official standards but flourished in north China among a wide range of social classes from the late sixteenth to early twentieth century. Chapter One studies the marginality of fox spirits in early Chinese tradition. Chapter Two discusses how during the Ming and Qing periods (1368–1911) fox cult practices subverted dominant cultural norms yet remained indispensable for practical needs in everyday life. Chapter Three examines the ways in which Ming-Qing people interpreted the fox in relation to ghosts, ancestors, celestial bureaucrats and female deities. Chapter Four charts the interaction among fox spirits, local people and officials. Chapter Five examines the multiple meanings of huxian , a popular term with which people addressed fox deities. The case of the fox cult suggests that in the face of consistent official proscription and suppression, popular cults survived and often thrived precisely because their “illicit” content accommodated socially suppressed voices and culturally repressed desires. The development of the cult was characterized by a dialectical movement of promoting the cult with official and public standards on the one hand and keeping it in line with personal, local and practical demands on the other. Cultural diversity and congruity were simultaneously produced in the practices of worshipping, exorcising, narrating and recording fox spirits at local, regional and national level and by the combined efforts of elite men, officials, and commoners. Shifting between official and unofficial boundaries, the people of late imperial China manipulated the marginal power of the fox to negotiate order out of cultural conflicts and compromises and to come to grips with larger social and political changes. The history of the fox cult illuminates the importance of religious beliefs and practices in today's China and relates the Chinese ways of life and thinking to cultures outside China.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, Religious history, Folklore, China, Cult of the fox, Imperial, Power",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
305345129,"Mullaney, Thomas Shawn","Coming to terms with the nation: Ethnic classification and scientific statecraft in modern China, 1928–1954",Contemporary,"For Chinese revolutionaries at the turn of the century, the collapse of the Qing dynasty was a mixed blessing. Although Han nationalists had achieved their stated objective, the disintegration of the Manchu regime was accompanied by a disintegration of the very Qing universalism which had kept the territories of China together for more than two centuries. Confronting the potential loss of Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and the provinces of the southwest, the empire-turned-nation-state of China ran the risk of being stillborn. Coming to Terms with the Nation examines the production of a new Chinese universalism in the twentieth century, forged through the convergence of two powerful, transnational worldviews: the state socialist worldview, as articulated by the Chinese Communists under Mao, and the social scientific worldview, as articulated by ethnologists operating in southwest China during the Second World War. The basic contours of this new universalism are readily apparent in contemporary China, whether in museums, on television, or even in conversations with taxi drivers in Yunnan. Pose the question of demographic diversity to practically anyone in the People's Republic, and more often than not one's interlocutor will respond, without hesitation or pause for reflection, that there are fifty-six minzu or nationalities in China---fifty-five minorities and the Han majority. Added together, moreover, these fifty-six groups are believed to form one synergistic whole: the unified, multiethnic People's Republic of China. Phrased mathematically, the equation reads 55+1=1. This strange calculus of Chinese nationhood constitutes a new form of universalism which, in both its power and pervasiveness, has surpassed even that of the Manchu regime. Where did this strange calculus come from? How was this equation derived and why in this particular form? The cornerstone of this new universalism was a project known as the Ethnic Classification, or minzu shibie. Through the examination of a wealth of recently declassified archival materials from the early PRC, as well as oral histories with surviving members of the project, this study explores how social scientists and PRC state authorities went about creating the ethnic minorities of China through coordinated processes of categorization and social engineering.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, Science history, Cultural anthropology, China, Ethnic classification, Nation, Scientific statecraft, Statecraft",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

I seek to complicate this picture by investigating women's roles in gender construction. By women's space I mean a constructed and mutable sphere in which women from all social classes experienced their life courses, became socialized, followed or negotiated norms of womanhood (or sometimes simply disregarded them), and transmitted women's culture generation after generation. My dissertation starts with the interpretation of women's legitimate living place the jia (family. home. house). The exploration of house structures and relevant accessories demonstrates how Song women negotiated between inner and outer, endowed private architectures with gendered meanings and public values, while at the same time showcased their dominance in and commitment to the jia. In the open sphere outside the jia, I trace female sojourners' images on the road, and thus reveal their movement and mobility, modes of transportation and redefinition of inner/outer boundary. Furthermore, I also investigate other structured spaces that women encountered—the local government and community. In these domains, women performed their agency through their diversified interactions with local administrative authority as well as their recognition of, participation in and contribution to the construction of local community. In the last part, I analyze women's tombs and burial practices to examine the connections between women's place on earth and in the afterlife. The exhaustive case studies of tomb structures, accessories, and murals in Song Fujian suggest that women's place in the afterlife is not a reflection of the hierarchies on earth but a new construction. In sum, the dissertation shows that women from various classes in Song Fujian established their legitimacy inside the jia on the one hand, while exercised their agency in the outside sphere on the other hand. The boundaries between inner and outer were subordinated to women's manipulation of places and objects, and thus characterized by negotiability and flexibility.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, Gender studies, China, Fujian, Object, Place, Song dynasty, Women's space",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2308668942,"Neubauer, Jack",Adopted by the World: China and the Rise of Global Intimacy,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the histories of international adoption and child sponsorship in China from the 1930s to the 1950s to illustrate China’s crucial but unrecognized role in shaping the politics and practices of global humanitarianism. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Chinese child welfare organizations developed a new form of humanitarian fundraising in which private citizens across the world “adopted” Chinese children by funding their lives at orphanages in China. Under the adoption model, Chinese children and their foreign “foster parents” built personal relationships through the exchange of photographs, gifts, and translated letters that used familial terms of address. The relationships forged between children and their foster parents constituted a new mode of affective and material exchange across national, racial, and cultural boundaries that I call “global intimacy.” At the same time, the adoption plan was also deeply ideological, embedding the relationships between children and their sponsors within the politics of WWII and the Cold War. At once emotional and economic, humanitarian and political, the adoption plan transformed the emotional loyalties of children into a key battleground on the affective terrain of these global conflicts. The emergence of the adoption plan as one of the most successful methods of humanitarian fundraising in China precipitated a broader “intimate turn” in global humanitarian practice. During WWII, Chinese child welfare organizations developed new discursive and material practices—as well as new global administrative structures—that made the adoption of Asian children into a distinct form of humanitarian rescue. After the war, an American organization called China’s Children Fund utilized the rhetoric of Christian love to transform the adoption plan into one of the largest humanitarian programs in Asia, systematizing the transnational flow of gifts and letters to create a paradoxical bureaucracy of global intimacy. When the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, rather than dismiss the adoption plan as a tool of the reactionary Nationalist Party and their American imperialist allies, they instead sought to transform it into a centerpiece of a new form of “revolutionary humanitarianism.” However, during the Korean War the CCP ultimately decided to dismantle all foreign humanitarian institutions in China, leading transnational aid organizations to again remake the adoption plan as a lynchpin of a new “Cold War humanitarianism” across East Asia. “Adopted by the World” sheds light on the global history of humanitarianism, the intertwining of intimate relations and international relations during the WWII and Cold War eras, and the political significance of children in modern Chinese history. By analyzing how Chinese child welfare institutions utilized children’s letters to mold international opinion of China, I show how children were enlisted as key actors within the political campaigns of both the Nationalist and Communist parties. Engaging with recent scholarship that has argued that the provision of global humanitarian aid served the Cold War foreign policy interests of Western powers, this dissertation explores how the recipients and critics of humanitarian aid in China both shaped and challenged the post-WWII global humanitarian order.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,History,History,"History, World History, Asian History, Adoption, Childhood, China, Global, Humanitarianism, Intimacy",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

305007190,"Chiang, Chi Lu",The scale of war in the Warring States period,Ancient,"A comprehensive study of the wars and the scale of war in the Warring States period has seldom been conducted because of the academic training required for the job, the Chinese traditional preference for the “civil” over the “martial,” and the complexity of the job. Traditional scholars were hindered from uncovering the number of inter-state wars fought during subperiods because of the lack of information in these subperiods and the lack of appropriate methods to identify such data. While the former problem has been offset by the archaeological findings in the past several decades, the latter is solved by the application of the statistic method of interpolation. Since there is no systematic theory or hypothesis in the study of the scale of war, the author must set a conceptual framework for the study. After solving the problems of defining, identifying, and counting wars, a comparative study of wars in the Warring States period and those in its predecessor, the Spring and Autumn period, is conducted not only to characterize the Warring States period, but also to present two different Chinese models for dealing with warfare. Hundreds of wars are thus examined and the results are included for the convenience of future study. From the study of the sources on both periods, twelve measurements—seven quantitative and five qualitative—are found for the scale of war of both periods.

A useful handbook for the history and practice of sacrificial rituals, the text is a vehicle for Ch'iu's program of religious reform. He perceived the ritual performance of sacrificial offerings of his time to have strayed from the norms established by the sages of antiquity: the people had forgotten their own spiritual tradition, he claimed, and had turned toward Buddhists, Taoists, and magicians for their religious needs. He prevailed upon the reader to turn away from these traditions and return to the Confucian principles for communicating with the spirits, and to return to what he believed to be the aniconic form of spirituality that valued rites as expressions of inner moral qualities. In the Offerings, Ch'iu presented his views of the spirit world and described the basic principles for conducting sacrificial offerings. In describing the role of prayer, shamanism, and exorcism as means for communicating with spiritual beings, he advocated a revival of the Chou dynasty office of shaman. Regarding the rites offered to the sages of the Confucian tradition, he proposed that the three-dimensional images employed in those rites be destroyed and replaced with spirit tablets, and he advocated the elimination of fictive posthumous titles in lieu of simpler names.

1034278818,"Vogt, Paul Nicholas",Between Kin and King: Social Aspects of Western Zhou Ritual,Ancient,"The Western Zhou period (ca. 1045-771 BCE) saw the dissemination of a particular style of ancestral ritual across North China, as the Zhou royal faction leveraged its familiarity with the ritual techniques of the conquered Shang culture to complement its project of state formation. Looking back on this era as the golden age of governance, Eastern Zhou and Han thinkers sought to codify its ritual in comprehensive textual treatments collectively known as the Sanli and, in particular, the Zhouli, or Rites of Zhou. Later scholarship has consistently drawn on the Sanli as a reference point and assumed standard for the characterization of Western Zhou rites. Current understandings of the formative era of early Chinese ritual are thus informed by the syncretic and classicizing tendencies of the early empires. To redress this issue, the present study explores the ritual practices of the Western Zhou based on their records on inscribed bronzes, the most extensive source of textual information on the period. It characterizes Western Zhou ancestral rites as fluid phenomena subject to continued redefinition, adoption, cooption, and abandonment as warranted by the different interests of Western Zhou elites. Separate discussions consider the role of ancestral rites and inscribed bronzes in materializing the royal presence within the interaction spheres of elite lineages. the evolution of ritual performances of Zhou kingship, and their relationship to the military and political circumstances of the royal house. the emergence of new ritual contexts of patronage, recognition, and reward that differentiated between members of expanding lineages and intensified royal control over key resources. and the combination of multiple ritual techniques with royal hospitality provision to create major ritual event assemblies.

305356842,"Illich, Marina","Selections from the life of a Tibetan Buddhist polymath: Chankya Rolpai Dorje (Lcang skya rol pa'i rdo rje), 1717–1786",Modern,"This dissertation examines the life of Chankya Rolpai Dorje (Lcang skya rol pa'i rdo rje), an 18 th -century Tibetan Buddhist lama who played a pivotal historical role in mid-Qing dynasty Tibetan-Manchu relations. A Tibetanized Mongol from the Kokonor region of today's northwest China, Chankya was brought to Beijing by imperial request as a young boy and groomed to serve in the Manchu court bureaucracy. Under Emperor Yongzheng's supervision, he underwent complete monastic training in the classical curriculum of Tibetan Buddhist arts and sciences while he simultaneously mastered Mongolian, Manchu and Chinese. During his youth at the court, he became close friends with his classmate the prince Hongli, who later took the throne as the illustrious Qianlong Emperor. At the height of his rule, the Qianlong Emperor installed Chankya as the senior-most lama at his court and appointed him to serve as his Tantric Buddhist guru. This little-known facet of the Qianlong Emperor's life positioned the emperor in a radically unorthodox and anti-Confucian position vis-à-vis his subject. As Tantric disciple, Qianlong was required to relinquish his authority over spiritual affairs to Chankya, observe a strict regimen of Buddhist vows and daily meditation practice and pay regular obeisance to his guru in the form of highly formalized ritual protocol. Ruler of the largest Chinese empire in history and Son of Heaven, subordinate to none but the ancestors and Heaven itself, Qianlong lived another life literally prostrate at the feet of his Tibetanized Mongol guru. While historians generally acknowledge that the Manchu Qing emperors cultivated ties with Tibetan Buddhist lamas, they rarely recognize the depth, sophistication and intricacy of these relations. Scholarship on the subject continues to reductively claim that the Manchus patronized Tibetan Buddhism solely to gain the submission of Buddhist Mongols and thus eliminate the perennial threat that a potentially united Mongol military front posed to Manchu hegemony. Though largely unexamined, Tibetan sources offer a different perspective. The contending narratives they contain seriously challenge both older, sinocentric characterizations of Qing emperors as fully Sinicized monarchs as well as the reductive tendency of some New Qing Studies scholars to narrowly conceptualize Tibetan influences at the Qing court as purely religious. This dissertation attempts to redress some of these scholastic oversights by examining selections of the life of Chankya Rolpai Dorje, the prodigious student of the Seventh Dalai Lama---Kalsang Gyatso---and Tantric guru to the Emperor Qianlong, as recorded in his primary Tibetan biography. The dissertation opens with a critique of how western academic constructions of Qing history have radically marginalized and often mischaracterized the influence of Tibetan Buddhism on Qing court culture and imperial policy. It then traces a genealogy of the Tibetan Buddhist system of lama-patron joint-administration, the seminal institution structuring Qing-Tibetan relations. Turning to the biography itself, the study then goes on to spotlight key events of Chankya's life, including his recognition and life as a child prodigy and his career as Tibetan Buddhist scholar, imperial preceptor and Tantric adept. It is my hope that in providing a window onto how one of the most illustrious Tibetan Buddhists at the Manchu court conceptualized the world around him, this study will be of use to scholars in rethinking the history of Qing-Tibetan relations.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Biographies, Buddhism, Chankya Rolpai Dorje, China, Qing dynasty, Tibetan Buddhist",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2050000002,"Kung, Chien Wen","Nationalist China in the Postcolonial Philippines: Diasporic Anticommunism, Shared Sovereignty, and Ideological Chineseness, 1945-1970s",Contemporary,"This dissertation explains how the Republic of China (ROC), overseas Chinese (huaqiao), and the Philippines, sometimes but not always working with each other, produced and opposed the threat of Chinese communism from the end of World War II to the mid-1970s. It is not a history of US-led anticommunist efforts with respect to the Chinese diaspora, but rather an intra-Asian social and cultural history of anticommunism and nation-building that liberates two close US allies from US-centric historiographies and juxtaposes them with each other and the huaqiao community that they claimed. Three principal arguments flow from this focus on intra-Asian anticommunism. First, I challenge narrowly territorialized understandings of Chinese nationalism by arguing that Taiwan engaged in diasporic nation-building in the Philippines. Whether by helping the Philippine military identify Chinese communists or by mobilizing Philippine huaqiao in support of Taiwan, the ROC carved out a semi-sovereign sphere of influence for itself within a foreign country. It did so through institutions such as schools, the Kuomintang (KMT), and the Philippine-Chinese Anti-Communist League, which functioned transnationally and locally to embed the ROC into Chinese society and connect huaqiao to Taiwan. Through these groups, the ROC shaped the experiences of a national community beyond its territorial boundaries and represented itself as the legitimate “China” in the world. Second, drawing upon political theory, I argue that the anticommunist relationship between the ROC, the Philippines, and the Philippine Chinese constituted a form of what I call shared, non-territorial sovereignty. Nationalist China did not secure influence over Chinese in the Philippines by exerting military or economic pressure, as a neocolonial regime might. Vast disparities in power did not obtain between Manila and Taipei, as they did between them and Washington. Rather, for reasons of law, culture, linguistic incapacity, and ideology, the Philippines selectively outsourced the management of its Chinese residents to the ROC. In turn, both depended on the Chinese being able to govern themselves with state support, coercive and otherwise. The Philippine Chinese, as in colonial times, were thus semi-autonomous actors who participated in the construction of shared sovereignty after World War II by forging ties with states to advance their anticommunist agenda. This three-way relationship provides a framework for thinking about postcolonial sovereignty in East Asia that focuses on relations of relative equality between states and the relative autonomy of the Chinese as a minority population, rather than between dominant and dominated or in terms of territory. Nationalist China and the Philippines’ nation-building projects had profound consequences for the Philippine Chinese. While these peoples were in many respects acted upon by the ROC and Philippine states through legal and coercive means, they by no means lacked agency. Rather, they performed their agency as consensual participants in making anticommunism. In focusing on them, the dissertation shifts from international and transnational history to social and cultural history and the history of civic life. Existing scholarship, whether in the social sciences or Sinophone Studies, largely depicts the postcolonial hua subject as a non-ideological businessman or cultural producer. I argue, by contrast, that the overseas Chinese could be eminently ideological and politically active. From informing on suspected Chinese communists to the ROC and Philippine states to proclaiming their loyalties to the ROC and Chiang Kai-shek, anticommunist social practices enabled Philippine huaqiao to come to terms with being legally disadvantaged and ideologically suspect minorities in their country of residence. Unlike racial and cultural Chineseness, which they could or would not give up, they could and did choose to behave ideologically; and in doing so, they legitimized their community to the Philippine state and Filipino society.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,History,History,"Social sciences, Anticommunism, Cold War, Overseas Chinese, Philippines, Taiwan,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2210000022,"Luo, Weiwei",The Common Good: Property and State-Making in Late Imperial China,Modern,"The Common Good offers new perspectives on the early modern global revolution in ideas of economy and the polity. It argues that the modern Chinese state emerged from the disenchantment of a moral economy that had dominated since the sixteenth century. Monetization and commercialization produced both concepts of public goods and institutions pertaining to public properties that drew from medieval prototypes. Having no place within the formal legal system, the governance of these resources relied on supernatural justice, rituals of generosity, and a rhetoric of virtue that brought together popular practice and learned culture. By the nineteenth century, however, these moral and supernatural elements were superseded by new modes of accountability that replaced gods with notions of the public or the people, and by new technologies of public writing and reckoning that privileged numbers and calculations as reliable evidence. This shift in arbiters of trust generated what can be called an “accountable managerial state,” in contrast with the “agrarian legislative state” that persisted throughout the previous centuries in imperial China. At first glance, this trajectory bears a superficial resemblance to that of Europe during the early modern period. My analysis reveals, however, that these were native developments, originating at the level of local societies in China before working their way upward to the state level. In short, my research has brought entirely indigenous set of Chinese ideas and institutions into a global history of the state and political economy, as well as opened the way for rich comparative study with other parts of the world.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,History,History,"Social sciences, China, Common Good,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2030000000,"Chen, John Tseh-han","Islamic Modernism in China: Chinese Muslim Elites, Guomindang Nation-Building, and the Limits of the Global Umma, 1900-1960",Contemporary,"Modern Chinese Muslims’ increasing connections with the Islamic world conditioned and were conditioned by their elites’ integrationist politics in China. Chinese Muslims (the “Hui”) faced a predicament during the Qing and Ottoman empire-to-nation transitions, seeking both increased contact with Muslims outside China and greater physical and sociopolitical security within the new Chinese nation-state. On the one hand, new communication and transport technologies allowed them unprecedented opportunities for transnational dialogue after centuries of real and perceived isolation. On the other, the Qing’s violent suppression of Muslim uprisings in the late nineteenth century loomed over them, as did the inescapable Han-centrism of Chinese nationalism, the ongoing intercommunal tensions between Muslims and Han, and the general territorial instability of China’s Republican era (1911–49). As a result, Islamic modernism—a set of positions emphasizing both reason and orthodoxy, and arguing that true or original Islam is compatible with science, education, democracy, women’s rights, and other “modern” norms—took on new meanings in the context of Chinese nation-making. In an emerging dynamic, ethos, and discourse of “transnationalist integrationism,” leading Chinese Muslims transformed Islamic modernism, a supposedly foreign body of thought meant to promote unity and renewal, into a reservoir of concepts and arguments to explain and justify the place of Islam and Muslims in China, and in so doing made it an integral component of Chinese state- and nation-building. “Islamic Modernism in China” argues that Chinese Muslims’ transregional engagement with Islamic modernism did not subvert but enabled the Chinese government’s domestic and foreign policies toward Muslims, and ultimately facilitated the nationalization of Muslim identity in modern China. From Qing collapse through the Second World War, urban coastal Chinese Muslim religious and political elites imported, read, debated, disseminated, and translated classic Islamic texts and modern Muslim print media, while establishing their own modernist schools and publications. Yet those same figures, through those same practices and institutions, increasingly wielded an image of Islamic authority and authenticity in support of the nationalist Guomindang government’s efforts to develop, integrate, and Sinicize China’s frontiers, including the predominantly Sufi Muslim communities of the Northwest. In the 1930s and early 1940s, integrationist Chinese Muslim elites further mobilized modernist narratives of Islam’s rationality, peacefulness, and past and present “contributions” to China. For example, they responded to Islamophobic misperceptions about halal by arguing that Islamic medicine was an important part of Chinese medicine. They also dispatched nationalistic goodwill delegations to the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and China’s own frontiers during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), to pursue cultural cooperation and spread anti-Japanese propaganda. At the same time, in contrast to this instrumentalized Islam, certain Chinese Muslim scholars studying in Cairo instead articulated an expansive, democratized version of the Islamic concept of independent human reason (ijtihad ) as the basis for a more inclusive vision of both Chinese nationalism and the global Islamic community (umma). The opportunity to pursue this or any other alternative to mere integrationism soon evaporated, however, as the renewed Chinese Civil War (1945-49) split the Chinese Muslim elites across the Mainland, Taiwan, and a variety of Muslim and non-Muslim countries. Thereafter, the Chinese Muslim elites largely became marginalized from high politics in the era of Cold-War and decolonization. Many of their once-contingent narratives of history and identity, however, have nevertheless been normalized as the canonical truth of Chinese Islam to this day, quietly informing China’s minority policies, foreign relations, and rhetoric of the “New Silk Road.” “Islamic Modernism in China” is a history of the subsumption of modern forms of mobility by modern structures of power. It narrates an assertion of difference in the context of multiple, partially overlapping integrations: the integration of a Han-centric idea of the Chinese nation-state, of an Arabo-centric idea of the Islamic world, and of a Eurocentric system of global infrastructures, institutions, networks, and knowledge. It de-parochializes the modern history of Chinese Muslims, showing how they epitomized aspirations and challenges common to Muslim minorities across many large non-Muslim societies and, to an extent, to modern Muslims everywhere. Using a wide range of new or under-studied archival and published sources in Chinese and Arabic, it connects questions of the meaning and scope of Islam, Islamic community, and Islamic modernism (scholarship on which tends to prioritize the Arab Middle East and relations with the West) to questions of religion and state in modern China (scholarship on which tends to prioritize popular spirituality and the official Confucian system, as well as relations with the West).

2050000003,"Kuzuoglu, Ulug",Codes of Modernity: Infrastructures of Language and Chinese Scripts in an Age of Global Information Revolution,Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the global history of Chinese script reforms—the effort to phoneticize Chinese language and/or simplify the writing system—from its inception in the 1890s to its demise in the 1980s. These reforms took place at the intersection of industrialization, colonialism, and new information technologies, such as alphabet-based telegraphy and breakthroughs in printing technologies. As these social and technological transformations put unprecedented pressure on knowledge management and the use of mental and clerical labor, many Chinese intellectuals claimed that learning Chinese characters consumed too much time and mental energy. Chinese script reforms, this dissertation argues, were an effort to increase speed in producing, transmitting, and accessing information, and thus meet the demands of the industrializing knowledge economy. The industrializing knowledge economy that this dissertation explores was built on and sustained by a psychological understanding of the human subject as a knowledge machine, and it was part of a global moment in which the optimization of labor in knowledge production was a key concern for all modernizing economies. While Chinese intellectuals were inventing new signs of inscription, American behavioral psychologists, Soviet psycho-economists, and Central Asian and Ottoman technicians were all experimenting with new scripts in order to increase mental efficiency and productivity. This dissertation reveals the intimate connections between the Chinese and non-Chinese script engineering projects that were taking place synchronically across the world. The chapters of this work demonstrate for the first time, for instance, that the simplification of Chinese characters in the 1920s and 1930s was intimately connected to the discipline of behavioral psychology in the US. The first generation of Chinese psychologists employed the American psychologists’ methods to track eye movements, count word-frequencies, and statistically analyze the speed of reading, writing, and memorizing in order to simplify and “rationalize” the Chinese writing system in an effort to discipline and optimize mental labor. Other chapters explore the issue of mental and clerical optimization by finding the origins of the Chinese Latin Alphabet (CLA), the mother of pinyin, in hitherto unknown Eurasian connections. The CLA, the pages of this work shows, was the product of a transnational exchange that involved Ottoman and Transcaucasian typographers as well as Russian engineers and Chinese communists who sought efficiency in knowledge production through inventing new scripts. Situating the Chinese script reforms at this global intersection of psychology, economy, and linguistics, this dissertation examines the global connections and forces that turned the human subject into a knowledge worker who was cognitively managed through education, literacy, propaganda, and other measures of organizing information, all of which had the script at the center. The search for efficiency and productivity—the core values of industrialism—lay at the heart of script reforms in China, but this search was inseparable from linguistic orders and political ambitions. Even if writing, transmitting, and learning a phonetic script could theoretically be easier and more efficient than the Chinese characters, the alphabet opened a veritable Pandora’s Box around the issue of selection: given the complex linguistic landscape in China, which speech was a phonetic script supposed to represent? There were myriad languages spoken throughout the empire and the subsequent nation-state, most of which were mutually incomprehensible. Mandarin as spoken in Beijing was different from that spoken in the south, and “topolects” or regional languages such as Min or Cantonese were to Mandarin what Romanian is to English. As a linguistic life-or-death issue, phonetic scripts stood for the infrastructural possibilities and limitations in the representation of speeches. Some scripts, such as Lao Naixuan’s phonetic script composed of more than a hundred signs, were capable of representing multiple Mandarin and non-Mandarin speeches; whereas others, such as Phonetic Symbols that only has thirty-seven syllabic signs, represented only one speech, i.e., Mandarin. Using Mandarin-oriented scripts to transcribe non-Mandarin speeches was like writing English with fifteen letters, hence the acrimonious disputes that fill the pages of this dissertation. Succinctly put, it was at the level of script invention that Chinese and non-Chinese actors engineered different infrastructures not only for laboring minds but also for the social world of Chinese languages. The history of information technologies and knowledge economy in China was thus inseparable from the world of speech and language, as each script offered a new potential to reassemble the written matter and the speaking mind in a different way. “Codes of Modernity” thus conceptualizes the script itself as an infrastructural medium. A script was not merely a passive carrier of information, but an existential artifact. Building on an expanding literature on infrastructures, it endorses the observation that infrastructures, technologies, and the social world around them work in a recursive loop. An infrastructure is not just the physical object that permits the flow of information, goods, ideas, and people, but a sociotechnical product that enables the experience of culture, while imposing constrains on it at the same time. Like electricity grids, transportation systems, and sewage canals, the experience of scripts as infrastructures is the experience of thought worlds. After a long tradition of structuralism and poststructuralism that sought to understand the world through the semiotic prism of language, “Codes of Modernity” argues that it is time for an infrastructuralism that excavates the indispensable media that enable the production of language and thought.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,History,History,"Social sciences, Language modernization, Mental labor, Romanization and latinization, Russo-ottoman relations, Sino-soviet relations, Writing technologies,",68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2718093484,"Wu, Dongming",The Bronze Economy and the Making of the Southern Borderlands under the Zhou Dynasty (1045–256 BCE),Medieval,"This dissertation examines the vital role of bronze in the political, economic, and cultural interactions in the southern borderlands during the period of the Zhou dynasty (1045–256 BCE) in present-day Hubei province, China. It shows how the bronze economy—the production, exchange, and consumption of bronze goods—transformed the borderlands landscape. It adopts a bottom-up perspective and argues that instead of controlling the redistribution of metal, the Zhou state competed and negotiated with the local powers on the acquisition of metal resources. The regional states and indigenous polities were not passively acculturated to the Zhou center but developed local bronze culture and casting technology. Through the economic perspective, this dissertation examines social interaction not in the traditional binary of center and periphery or the royal domain and regional states but in politico-economic zones transcending political boundaries. Based on textual, archeological, and paleographical evidence, it discusses how the indigenous people in the southeastern Hubei mining region joined a transregional economic network. It also traces metal exchange, bronze production, and technology innovation in the Sui-Zao Corridor, the crossroads connecting north and south throughout the Zhou dynasty. This dissertation uses archaeometallurgical method to examine the circulation of bronze-smelting knowledge between Sujialong and other mining societies. Statistical analysis of the Sifangtang cemetery makes it possible to reconstruct the changing societal organization at the Tonglüshan mines under different political powers. This dissertation argues that the bronze economy led to unique ways of social interaction and created transregional social networks, and thus shaped the southern borderlands of the Zhou dynasty.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,NA,68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

More broadly, it explores how air defense in general became an integral part of the Nationalists’ “war of resistance and reconstruction” (kangzhan jianguo), a fascist project derived from total war, the globally circulating military-political idea holding that modern warfare would enlist entire nations and their economies in war while also subjecting them to comprehensive enemy violence. The Nationalists joined the world in confronting aerial bombing after the Empire of Japan bombed Shanghai in 1932. In response, the government and its military constructed air defense, a political and technological complex combining mass mobilization, through air raid drills and air defense organizations, with material technologies, like searchlights, anti-aircraft guns, and bomb shelters. The Nationalists found in air defense more than a military technology. To them, it also offered a set of tools and resources for fortifying their flailing attempts to unite China in a common national project, and even recasting the substance of that project. Air defense could forge a new society that invested all Chinese people in war as a necessary precondition for overcoming China’s colonial subjection. Where democratic Meanwhile, a group of young architects associated with the journal Xin jianzhu in Canton identified air defense as an organizing problem for the nascent professional field of architecture. Rather than the stale historicism endorsed in Nanjing, and against China’s craft building traditions, the group championed modernist architecture, especially the International Style, whose principles of simplicity, functionalism, and rationality they saw as necessary for building modern, industrial, and hygienic Chinese cities capable of enhancing human life. Moreover, they argued that the technological instrumentality informing modernism made it the only style capable of preserving Chinese cities and people from modern threats like bombing. After the fall of Canton in 1938, members of the group took their mission to Chongqing, where they joined the Nationalist government in building air defenses in the wartime capital. institutions collapsed and appeals to common heritage and customs failed, the Nationalists used air defense to turn survival (shengcun) into the bedrock value of the national community. In particular, this dissertation argues that the air raid shelter and air defense focused contradictions in the Nationalists’ fascist project for uniting and revolutionizing China as it traveled to Chongqing following the Nationalist escape from Japan’s invasion of the coast. Over the course of the war, the principal technology of air defense shifted away from mass mobilization, as the Nationalists came to administer refugees and displaced people they had never governed before, and became located in infrastructure like city plans and air raid shelters. Air defense served to exclude surplus populations like women and the elderly, rendered redundant according to the state’s wartime needs for industrial production and conscripts, by dispersing them in satellite settlements outside the city, from which they constantly returned in search of work or material goods. Shoddy air raid shelters, in the meantime, revealed the fragile biology of real bodies beneath the fascist fantasy of the heroic political subject, as shelters failed to provide for basic needs like respiration. Over time, these two problems collided, as the state closed shelters in the city to dispersed people, exposing surplus populations to bombing, while civilians also languished in shelters that could still kill them. The goal of building national unity through survival collapsed into a confusion of inclusion and exclusion, life and death, with disastrous results, like the asphyxiation of around one thousand people in Chongqing’s largest public air raid shelter in June 1941. In these circumstances, professionals like the Cantonese architects and new state regulatory bodies produced proposals and standards for building better shelters, attempting a technical resolution of air defense’s political contradictions and consolidating the transformation of air defense into a primarily technological discipline.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,Columbia University,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,NA,68,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2360000000,"Ding, Yuhua ",Chamber with Winds and Rains: On the Collecting Practice of Deng Shi and His Contemporaries,Modern,"During the historical transition period from Qing empire to early Republic, China was influenced by two concurrent forces that were reshaping society: the introduction of Western learning and the anti-Manchu Movement. Synthesizing the zeitgeist, the last generation of Qing intellectuals proposed a retrieval of China’s cultural past to correct ineffective Qing policies. Their ambitious efforts ultimately expanded to the preservation, re-collection, and reframing of the totality of China’s ancient arts and antiquities. In this late Qing intellectual trend, promoted by Deng Shi and his fellows within the National Essence Group, Chinese art was for the first time recognized as part of “national learning” and “national essence.” Traditional antiquarian activities were challenged by contemporary issues that emerged from political and educational reform, locality, and concepts of nation-building and modernization. As a national essence man, collector and publisher, Deng Shi differentiated himself from collectors of the past by enlisting his private collection in the broader mission of preserving ancient relics and antiquities. He also advocated for an all-embracing definition of Chinese art that accepted the historically non-traditional as part of a national past. At the same time however, Deng saw the value of literati culture in the framing of Chinese art. His large collection of Ming loyalist art reflected a rising concern among progressive Chinese intellectuals who saw the harm of an absolute monarchy to Chinese society and culture. His promotion of literati cultural practices from painting to rubbing was an indigenous response to the Western collection of Chinese art at the time, an effort that ultimately clarified the boundaries of traditional fine art for later individuals to approach Chinese art more critically.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,"History of Art, Archaeology, and Visual Studies",Art and Archaeology,"Antiquarianism, Art collecting, Shi, Deng, Binhong, Huang, Late Qing, National Essence Group,",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
305206272,"Farris, Johnathan Andrew","Dwelling on the edge of empires: Foreigners and architecture in Guangzhou (Canton), China",Contemporary,"Cross-cultural relations are spatial relations. Foreign neighborhoods of Guangzhou, China, provide good examples of shifting attitudes towards race, class, and cohabitation. The banks of the Pearl River witnessed the earliest and longest settlement of English speaking Westerners in China. From the late 18 th to the early 20 th centuries, a series of structural types housed the Western trading and missionary community in Guangzhou. As foreigners gained increasing access to various parts of the city, and as tourist practices changed, so did foreign views of the Cantonese and their spaces and places. These evolutions represent differing relationships towards the Chinese employees of Western enterprises and different relationships to the inhabitants of the Chinese city at large. A range of visual and documentary resources, collected from repositories across the globe, demonstrates at least three distinct phases of spatial organization of the foreign neighborhoods, illustrating shifting strategies of regulating Chinese/foreign interaction by both the Western inhabitants and the Chinese authorities. The initial phase, represented by the Shisan Hang , consists of Westerners and Chinese employees living in close quarters in structures following closely Cantonese vernacular precedents, but also matching Western conceptions of working/service space versus piano nobile . The second phase includes the post-Arrow War construction of the concession island of Shamian . Its climate-adapted but more Westernized structures represent an increased separation of foreigners in Chinese staff, both spatially and socially. This coincides with the rise of certain racist attitudes and increased regulation of the foreigners' environments. During the 19 th century, foreigners in conjunction with their Chinese hosts developed a range of opinions about what in the city fabric represented the Cantonese as a people. While some of these strategies exist well into the early twentieth century, a re-engagement with the Chinese and their city occurs on the eve of the Westernization of the city at large in the 1920s and 1930s. The final phase of this work addresses the spread of new multi-national corporate enterprises, and architecture highly analogous to the structures of the foreigners' home countries, and the geographical spread of missionary projects, bring the Chinese and Westerners back under the same roof.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"Architecture, Art history, History, Architecture, China, Dwelling, Empires, Foreigners, Guangzhou",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
1732671328,"Huang, Junliang","The politics of storytelling: Schemas of time and space in Japan's traveling imagination of semi-colonial China and beyond, 1920s-1980s",Contemporary,"Centered on the works of three Japanese writers, namely Akutagawa Ryūnosuke (1892-1927), Hayashi Kyōko (1930- ), and Takeda Taijun (1912-1976), and with references to many other writers such as Tanizaki Jun’ichirō, Yokomitsu Riichi, and Takeuchi Yoshimi, in this dissertation I look into those narrative accounts for a changing pattern in their structure of storytelling about semi-colonial China. My project is in many ways indebted to but also fundamentally different from studies of Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges under semicolonialism, in the sense that it is a subtle literary analysis organized around a theoretical problematic, rather than an effort for a comprehensive history. I highlight the politics of storytelling in our texts by examining the temporality and spatiality, narrative devices, linguistic politics, and so on in the writer’s storytelling. I take the literary texts discussed in this dissertation as always socially constructed, and as “narrative accounts” that consist of elements of figuration, rather than considering them as the unmediated reproduction of the historical “truth” about the writers or about the Chinese and Japanese societies they traveled/lived in and between. Chapter One is a careful examination of Akutagawa Ryunosuke’s narrative of prewar China, entitled Travels in China. Chapter Two focuses on the politics of storytelling in Hayashi Kyōko’s autobiographical novel Michelle Lipstick (1980), read together with several other works of hers. Chapter Three is organized around discussions of three major works on China by Takeda, entitled Sima Qian ( Shiba Sen , 1943), The Judgment ( Shinpan , 1947), and Shanghai Firefly ( Shanhai no hotaru , 1976), while referring to several of his essays written between those years as secondary materials. I reach two conclusions. First, I contend that there is an obvious shift in the ways that prewar and postwar Japanese writers construct the time and space of semicolonial China in their works. And secondly, I hold that the allegorical meaning of storytelling lies in the space it opens up for literary critics and literary historians to access the relations between the writer, the narrator, and the surrounding social space, which, in my opinion, are the reality of the past that we have been trying to find in literature.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Asian History, China, Japan, Narrative theory, Postwar Japan, Storytelling, Time and space, Travel writing, War narrative",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
304792150,"Lee, Haiyan Festa","In the name of love: Virtue, identity, and the structure of feeling in modern China",Contemporary,"The word qing (sentiment, feeling, or love) had a ubiquitous presence in early twentieth-century Chinese literature and popular culture. Writers wrote novels of sentiment, essayists expounded on the connection between sentiment and society, reformers lamented the absence of national sympathy, historians compiled histories of romantic love, folklorists searched for spontaneous passion in folk songs and legends, magazine editors put out special issues on love and promoted debates on the rules of love, and revolutionaries strove to legislate the relationship between love and revolution. Why was there such a sustained preoccupation with qing in a period of enlightenment, nationalism, women's liberation, and commercial culture? Previous scholarship in Chinese literature has largely failed to raise this question because “love” has too often been taken for granted as the most natural and universal literary motif. But as a number of cultural and literary historians have recently argued, love has a history and its history is intimately bound up with the experience of modernity. My dissertation examines a family of affective notions ( qing, ai, yu , etc.) in a range of texts that span literary, historical, philosophical, sociological, and popular cultural genres from the late Qing to the mid-Republican period (1900 to 1935). I seek to demonstrate that the diverse discussions and representations of love constituted a literary public sphere where modern notions of interiority, gender, sexuality, family, and the nation were imagined and contested. My dissertation traces the genealogy of love from a technology of modern subjectivity and a democratic rallying cry against patriarchal hierarchies to an instrument of nationalist hegemony and revolutionary mobilization. Through an eclectic methodology that combines literary criticism, history, comparative analysis, and critical social theory, I challenge views of sentimentalism as indulgence in unthinking emotion as well as artificial boundaries between genres, historical periods, and disciplines. Moreover, I engage theoretical debates on the social construction of emotions, the history of sexuality, the rise of the nuclear family, and the triumph of nationalism.

In a finding that contradicts the dominant assertion that Emperor Wu promoted Confucians to power, I demonstrate that they amounted to a tiny minority in the upper levels of the bureaucracy. Socially and politically weak, Confucians painfully navigated officialdom, competing with powerful officials who had enjoyed power and privileges for generations. Sima Qian skillfully reproduced this struggle when he wrote The Collective Biographies of Confucians (Rulin liezhuan) in The Grand Scribe's Records ( Shiji ). Not until Emperor Xuan came to power, approximately twenty years after Emperor Wu's reign, did Confucians gradually become a fairly competitive group in the high levels of officialdom. During the transition between Emperor Wu and Emperor Zhao, membership of the upper-level ruling class had undergone fundamental changes. The most powerful official families who had dominated the court for decades were almost all eradicated during the witchcraft scandal towards the end of Emperor Wu's rule.

My central concern in this study is to show how non-colonizers such as Russians, who were perceived as racially white but were not colonizers, and the offspring of interracial marriages between Chinese and Russians, (Taiwanese) Chinese, and Koreans in Manchukuo simultaneously mapped out and destabilized the boundaries of race and nationality within the processes of nation-building and (de)colonization. This study draws upon historiography, narratology, reader-response criticisms, and various literary and cultural theories to examine one of the central concerns: the use of language in narrative and (oral) history. the systems of signs are not only a primary and powerful means to forge racial, hybrid, and national identities. they are also the very location where boundary making and crossing are simultaneously constituted and deconstructed. The flux of asymmetrical but interrelated racial relations reifies to some degree cultural agents’ changing ideas of race and racial thinking. Yet the employment of their diverse modes of rhetoric and trope to describe changing ideas of race and racial thinking simultaneously yields unexpected disruptive effects on the essentialization and centralization of nationality, so that the construction and accumulation of national capital are hampered by the same processes of articulation in writing, however inconsiderable and limited the articulations are. Cultural agents’ social imagination and creative modes of representing and thinking about boundaries of race and ideas of the social are not strictly confined to building nationality and homogenization and stabilization of space, but rather, they inscribe the possibility of deterritorialization, as well as diverse and discursive historical contingencies that deconstruct race and nationality.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Film studies, China, Cultural production, Hybridity, Manchukuo, Manchuria, Racial harmony, Spatiality",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States

It will make a detailed analysis of how contemporary writers reflect upon the crisis of national cultural identity in their literary reinterpretation of local cultures and national history. Taking the emergence of root-searching literature in the mid-1980s as a departure point, the thesis will delineate the trajectory of an important literary development from root-searching literature into cultural narration of the 1990s. Focusing on the novels and essays by five well known writers: Gao Xingjian, Han Shaogong, Chen Zhongshi, Yu Qiuyu, as well as Jin Yong, the thesis will demonstrate that the search for national cultural identity in narrative literature is a significant phenomenon in contemporary Chinese culture and literature. Their search also shows the interactive relationship between the periphery and the center in a process of cultural transformation. Covering a long national history from pre-modern to modern times, these works vividly display a wide range of cultural diversity, especially the four basic cultural traditions: Ru, Dao, Sao, Shi (Confucianism, Daoism, Chu shaman culture, and Buddhism). Revealing a strong concern about the national future, their unusual popularity indicates not only success in literature but also the ethos of the time, in which we can discover the enduring influence of a cultural nationalist mentality embedded in both elite and popular minds. In addition, the thesis also intends to argue that these writers' critical thinking of tradition and their deconstruction of the official narratives of history have proven that their works should not be viewed as representing conservatism, but rather as creative endeavors to revive literature in a new historical context. Their reinterpretation of history and contemporary life once again reflects the intellectuals' commitment to the nation. a legacy that is associated with the May Fourth spirit as well as the literati tradition of social engagement. In the works discussed or mentioned in the thesis, several common artistic features are prominent in their treatment of local customs and national history. Their innovative narrative structure, such as the mixture of fiction and essay, their creativity in recontextualizing folk artistic traditions, and their strong personal imprints of conception and expression mark the resurrection of a literary self-consciousness. It is this literary self-consciousness that makes their works distinctive from those that serve either political power or commercial interests. Their artistic achievements have significantly contributed to the revival of Chinese literature in the late twentieth century. By taking contemporary literary texts as the concrete objects of cultural analysis, the thesis tries to make the understanding of Chinese culture as specific and tangible as possible. Given the extremely intricate nature of Chinese culture and history, I hope that my thesis will provide some clues for a further understanding of these issues, while refreshing our knowledge of contemporary Chinese literature.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Political science, Chen Zhongshi, China, Cultural identity, Gao Xingjian, Han Shaogong, Jin Yong, Root-searching, Yu Qiuyu",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
2300000023,"Chen, Shiau-Yun",Legitimating and Constraining Womanly Violence in Ming China (1368-1644),Modern,"This dissertation investigates socially-recognized, legally-allowed violence performed by women in positions of authority— mothers, wives, and masters—in fourteenth- to seventeenth-century China. I argue that during this period, changes in family structure both provoked new conflicts and led people to prioritize consanguineal relationships. Examining legal, didactic, and literary texts, this research identifies apparatuses that legitimated—and in certain contexts constrained—womanly violence. Violence by wives at the time had become inseparable from accusations of jealousy. Such violence was constrained when it challenged the premier value of the patriarchal family—having heirs; yet, wifely violence was considered legitimate when it was motivated by the maintenance of hierarchical order between the wife and the concubine. Mothers’ violent disciplining of children was considered to be a moral performance. Whether or not motherly violence was considered to be an appropriate form of discipline or transgressive depended on the relationship between mother and child. In disciplinary violence against consanguineal children, mothers were expected to exhibit the fatherly virtue of strictness. Disciplinary violence against non-consanguineal children was deemed more problematic. Violence by female masters was legitimated as a performance of status rather than gender. Women's expected gender performances could, in certain circumstances, come into conflict with status performances. Ming Literati used the hierarchical metaphor the parent-child relationship to legitimate their control and ownership over servants. Yet, being “parents” constrained masters’ violent abuse of and sexual access to their “children”-servants. My research thus reveals the ways in which women’s violence was integral to the changing structure of Chinese families. I argue that women, far from being passive victims of patriarchy, played essential roles in maintaining, reproducing, and transforming familial order in late imperial China.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,History,History,"Authority, Gender, Law, Ming China, Violence, Women,",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States

It is based on 14 months of fieldwork research in Taiwan and five months at two related pilgrimage centers in Fujian, China. I focus on two interrelated and mutually constitutive mediating processes through which locality is produced: First, the rituals of Beigang's local territorial cult and of visiting pilgrims. and second, culture work, a relatively recent form of explicit cultural production through amateur historical and folklore research and related cultural activities. Ritual and culture work can be analyzed as forms of media which mediate between people and place, and between local and trans-local processes and power. I trace the production of identities anchored in Mazu's temple by examining communal and individual practices and the ways in which their discourses of history, tradition, and piety are framed and deployed. Following an introduction, I describe how ritual mediates local identity in Beigang. The next two chapters map historical transformations in Beigang using a regional systems approach. I examine pilgrimage networks and other hierarchical relationships across Taiwan in order to trace Beigang's transformation into an island-wide pilgrimage center. The following chapters examine the practices and discourses of culture workers. They are co-opted by the state in the construction of an explicitly cultural national narrative, yet also challenge and critique particular local formations of power through their work. Local agents also deploy cultural and ritual practices and discourses through which they gain prestige and other forms of value. Finally, I discuss inter-communal rivalries as expressed through competition between temples and disputes over archaeological artifacts, to reveal local cultural identity practices as forms of boundary making. Religion and culture work have played an important role in Taiwan's largely successful negotiations with pressures of colonialism, modernity and globalization by providing a coherent framework within which the tensions inherent in change are both highlighted and contained.

The villages of eastern Hui'an are known for distinctive marriage customs, women's sartorial styles, gender divisions of labor, and same-sex networks, all of which distinguish the region from other rural Han communities. I examine how these features of local culture have been politicized by the state as markers of cultural backwardness and commodified by the mass media as symbols of exotic, ethnic difference. I argue that these constructions of difference have shaped gender and local-place identities in ways that prevent Hui'an residents from attaining national ideals of socialist modernity and Han-defined civility. After marriage, Hui'an women live apart from their husbands until they bear a child. The post-1949 state strove to abolish postmarital separation and other local customs through repeated reform campaigns, seeking to bring local practices into conformity with its socialist vision of civilized Han culture. I explain the failure of such campaigns by showing how economic collectivization policies worked at cross-purposes to those regulating marriage and family. By contrast, post-Mao era shifts in gender divisions of labor and the growth of mixed-sex workplaces, in conjunction with newly enforced population control policies and emerging ideals of romantic love, have made possible many of the transformations in customary practice earlier sought by the state. Although wage-labor opportunities and new standards for male-female interaction have liberalized marriage and courtship customs, they have also produced new dilemmas for young women subject to conflicting social and moral expectations. This study illustrates women's ambivalent responses to market reforms by examining the everyday domains of individual experience, desire, and interpersonal relations. It reveals the highly contentious nature of subject formation for young rural women in contemporary China, as they struggle with the progressive ideals promoted by state discourses and media representations in formulating their own desires and constructions of self.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, Womens studies, China, Cultural change, Hui'an county, Labor, Marriage",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States

Historians of this migration have recently argued that resettlement was a social engineering project designed to permanently change the human and agricultural geography of the People's Republic, making the border areas of the former Qing empire both modern and Chinese. This dissertation does not treat these two terms as self-evident, but rather asks how they were understood by the individuals participating in the integration of Xinjiang at one new military settlement, Shihezi. In the process of transforming the borderland, they appropriated different ideas about what was modern and what was Chinese. At Shihezi in the 1950s they produced competing ideas of how to build socialism in the borderland, particularly when modern was often understood as Soviet, not Chinese. What model of settlement did they follow, and why? In resettling Xinjiang they made decisions concerning organizational form, labor force, urban planning, and agriculture, and this dissertation investigates each of these four layers of settlement as they were introduced in Shihezi. In this case, several Chinese Party-military men such as Zhang Zhonghan and Tao Zhiyue mediated between Soviet advisors and Chinese Communist Party goals and joined with young men and women under their command to create a New China in Xinjiang that had little to do with the grand ideological directives of either Moscow or Beijing.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"History, Bingtuan, China, Production and Construction Corps, Shihezi, Xinjiang",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
304630154,"Hou, Xiaojia",Jumping the gun: Local agency and early experiments in the socialist transformation of rural society in revolutionary China,Contemporary,"This dissertation studies why in the early 1950s the Chinese Communist Party launched the agricultural cooperative movement, a movement in many crucial ways resembled the collectivization in the Soviet Union. Past research has treated China's cooperative movement as a campaign imposed from above by Mao Zedong. By refocusing the scholarly attention from the center to localities, instead, this dissertation discovers that in its early stage this movement had a measure of strong social support from below. Not denying Mao's dominant role, this dissertation examines the roles of others who were not at the top of the party's hierarchy. It shows how certain provincial and prefecture cadres provided Mao Zedong with inspiration, evidence, even the theories and finally succeeded in convincing Mao to endorse their plans. Refuting the conventional wisdom that takes this movement as a pre-determined one, this dissertation contends that this movement was the outcome of a complex combination of ideology, circumstances, contingencies, domestic politics, and personal ambitions. In addition to highlighting the institutional uncertainty and fluidity, this dissertation also studies the complex interplay between the state's agency and peasants. Peasants were not simply the receptacle of policies formulated at the highest levels of power: they were always seeking to adapt directives sent down from above to local conditions.

It is based on research undertaken at the archives and libraries of Xiamen and Fuzhou in China, and also Taiwan and Singapore. By tracing the history of the overseas Chinese through the archives along the migration routes that emanated from Xiamen. I am able to move beyond an unproblematic focus on the local or national in understanding the Chinese migrants and analyze the intricacies of their relationships with China within the larger framework of a diasporic space that spans China and Southeast Asia. This work thus provides an open and expansive approach to the study of Chinese cities and overseas Chinese and poses questions on the appropriate geographical scope for the conceiving of Chinese history. My central argument is that studies based solely on the conventional nation-state-centered approach or the recently conceptualized transnational approach are inadequate to provide a comprehensive view of the Chinese urban and migration experiences. On the one hand, a nation-state-centered approach assumes that overseas Chinese remain socially, politically, culturally, and even economically part of the Chinese nation-state, and their primordial tie to the homeland explains why they return and devote themselves to causes of China. On the other hand, the transnational approach minimizes the significance of the Chinese borders and focuses on the networks and connections that link overseas Chinese to many other states or communities. Under this interpretation, overseas Chinese are more concerned with the context abroad and are motivated by pragmatic reasons to return to China, if they return at all. All things considered, the two approaches are seemingly antagonistic and produce visions of Chinese cities and migrants that are strikingly contrasting. In this dissertation, I focus on Xiamen, a treaty port that was geo-politically grounded within China's national borders but also embedded in transoceanic migration and trade networks leaving it unbounded. I follow the lead of transnational scholars by considering how diasporic networks, of which Xiamen was an integral part, motivated Chinese communities and individuals from overseas to take initiatives in Xiamen. At the same time, I also follow the example of China-centered scholars in investigating how China, as a political entity or an imaginary homeland, continually pulled overseas Chinese back to China. By combining both perspectives, I unravel the various motivations for overseas Chinese returning to China, and argue that although overseas Chinese flexibly manipulated their identities abroad and in China, they too were constrained by certain structures—real and imagined—that China played a part in constructing. My interpretation has not attempted a systematic reconciliation of the nation-state and transnational approaches but it has shown that the two are not wholly incompatible.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"History, China, Identity, Migration, Overseas Chinese, Treaty ports, Xiamen",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
304879443,"Zhang, Wu",Fiscal stress and political order in rural China: Local government and peasant protest in Hunan in the 1990s and beyond,Contemporary,"Based on more than two years of ethnographic fieldwork in Hunan, the prototype of rural China, this dissertation explains why a predatory state emerged in China at the village, township, and county levels in the 1990s. It also explores patterns of peasant resistance to the predatory state and analyzes the impact of peasant protest on local and national rural policies. The local government in rural China experienced a profound fiscal crisis in the 1990s. Because of internal corruption and competition from the private sector, the public sector collapsed, depriving local governments of their main source of revenue. The tax-sharing system adopted in 1994 and various unfunded central mandates significantly increased local fiscal responsibilities. The fiscal crisis induced local governments to impose ever-increasing taxes and fees on peasants. The rise of the predatory local state led to widespread peasant discontent. In only a few cases, however, did peasants succeed in mounting sustained protest against the local government. This happened when peasants sensed an opening in the political opportunity structure and when peasant leaders emerged. Protests usually started when peasants acquired central documents on lowering peasant burdens, which they used to argue that they had the right to withhold taxes and fees. Peasant leaders were “peasant cadres” and “peasant intellectuals,” who were better-educated than other peasants and who had worked for the party-state at some point in their lives. As a result, they could speak and write well. They also had good knowledge of party polices, which allowed them to challenge the interpretative framework of the local government without appearing to question the legitimacy of the party-state. Finally, they provided a shield of protection for their fellow villagers. The state eventually repressed most protests by jailing protest leaders. However, protestors sometimes obtained economic concessions from the local government. Moreover, in the 2000s, the central government reformed rural public finance and introduced subsidies to peasants and local governments (the ”tax-for-fee reform” and the policy of “constructing the new socialist countryside”). This cycle of revenue maximization, resistance, and reform illuminates the interactive and mutually transformative relationship between the state and society in China.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"History, Economics, Political science, Public policy, Central China, China, Fiscal crisis, Local government, Peasant protest, Protest leadership, Rural taxation, Tax-for-fee reform",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
304501890,"Culp, Robert Joseph","Schooling and the social body: Ideology and the new hegemony in China's lower Yangzi region secondary schools, 1911-1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the roles which secondary schools played in the production of citizens and the transformation of social and political institutions in early Republican China (1911–1937). Schools served as important arenas for efforts to define the Chinese nation and to produce new citizens for it. Using textbooks, school publications, archival documents, and interviews, I reconstruct the ideological and political engagements among educators, state agents, students, and local elites as they developed in the secondary schools of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces. Theoretical tools from anthropology, critical pedagogy, and Gramscian Marxism help me to analyze how varied patterns of ideological contestation contributed to social and political change and cultural production in those schools and their communities. The reformist atmosphere inspired by the New Culture Movement transformed lower Yangzi region schools, as civic education characterized by dialogue over socio-political change introduced many students to democratic politics and a liberal vision of a new society. However, the pluralism of the 1920s generated contentious school politics and lively debates among proponents of competing ideologies that gradually resolved into a focus on producing cohesive communities and well-disciplined citizens. The resulting organic conception of national society found full expression in the curriculum and school activities of the Nanjing Decade (1927–1937). During that period the Nationalist Party dominated discourse on education, using schools to mobilize well-cultivated citizens for progressive development and membership in a harmonious and integrated social body. The Nationalist Party vision of nation and citizen proved most persuasive when it built on the prior ideals, goals, and practices of students and teachers in local schools. This project's effort to understand how schools contributed to processes of social and political change during this dynamic period of Chinese history builds on theories of education that stress the interplay between formal and informal curricula, the cultures of the school and of local society. This study also shows how students have been active agents in educational and social politics, and how engagement in local schools can contribute to broader forms of cultural, social, and political change.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"History, Education history, Cultural anthropology, China, Civic education, Hegemony, Ideology, Moral training, Nationalism, Political ideology, Secondary schools, Social body, Yangzi region",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
1923783574,"Kelly, Jason Michael","Chinese Communists in Global Capitalist Markets: International Commerce and the Rise of New China, 1937-1964",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the overlooked commercial relationships that linked Chinese communism to international capitalism from the early days of the Pacific War to the aftermath of the Great Leap Forward. By exploring the diversity and continuity of these relationships, this dissertation challenges the stark themes of socialist solidarity and capitalist hostility that frame much of the literature on communist China’s international experience under Mao. Instead, what emerges is an adaptive mode of CCP engagement with capitalism that transcended the Cold War ideological divide. Understanding the larger historical significance of this engagement requires thinking about these commercial transactions as more than the transfer of goods, services, and currencies. Business deals also served as sites for the exchange of ideas, habits, and beliefs, and as venues where individuals, institutions, and the logics that guided them underwent subtle but lasting transformations. These latent influences lie at the heart of this dissertation, which is as much a political, diplomatic, social, and cultural history of communist China in the world during the mid-twentieth century as it is an international history of Chinese communist business and trade. These findings contribute to several veins of historical scholarship. They advance debate over the significance of ideology to Cold War international relations by tracing how CCP foreign-policy ideas transformed through sustained contact with foreign capitalists. The project brings Mao's China into the field of transnational history by moving beyond high politics to explore working-level ties between the CCP and foreign firms, smuggling rings, and other nongovernmental organizations. Finally, this dissertation reorients the study of capitalism in China by challenging the longstanding presumption that liberation in 1949 marked China’s withdrawal from global capitalism. As the dissertation shows, China’s ties to capitalism transformed under Mao, but never broke off entirely. The dissertation draws from a variety of sources not typically associated with scholarship on Mao’s China. In addition to fresh documents produced by Chinese officials at the central, provincial, and municipal levels, the project also draws from advertisements, corporate statements, ship manifests, and other materials from commercial and state archives in China, Hong Kong, the United States, Japan, and Great Britain.",2017,2017,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,History,History,"History, History, China, Commerce, Foreign affairs, History, Trade",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
304803021,"McGrath, Thomas Eugene","Provincial militarism and foreign relations in China: Yunnan province and the Western powers, 1910–1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the dynamic relationship between the Yunnan provincial militarists, Cai E, Tang Jiyao, and Long Yun, and the British and French imperialist powers in the late Qing and early Republican periods (1910–1937). By considering several venues for interaction, frontier delimitation, industrial modernization, international trade and transportation, this study highlights Yunnan's provincial autonomy from China's central government and evaluates Yunnan's provincial militarists' effectiveness at conducting foreign relations with the Western powers. This project addresses two aspects of the study of warlordism in Republican China. First, it takes a critical view of militarists' interactions with foreign powers to assess the relationship between warlordism and imperialism in China. Second, it offers a reevaluation of the terms “warlord” and “militarist” giving them a distinct, analytical definition in the context of Sino-Western interaction. This study places the efforts of Yunnan's militarists within a spectrum of warlord foreign relations ranging from cooperative to contentious contingent upon their handling of the Yunnan-Burma undelimited frontier, foreign investments in provincial mining operations, and the Yunnan Railway. Tang Jiyao's willingness to compromise with foreign agents to the detriment of Yunnan and China in order to further his personal, expansionist ambitions comprises one end of the spectrum and Long Yun's long-term commitment to economic development and resistance to any external interference is at the opposite end of the spectrum. Between these two extremes, Cai E represents the many militarists who had minimal contact with foreign powers but showed acute awareness of the potential benefit or harm from foreign interaction. The history of the Yunnan militarists demonstrates Chinese warlords' and militarists' varied experiences with Western imperialism and challenges the prevailing belief that warlordism and imperialism combined to weaken China.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, China, Foreign relations, France, Great Britain, Militarism, Provincial militarism, Yunnan province",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States
1016081123,"Tinn, Hong-Hong","Working with computers, constructing a developing country: Introducing, using, building, and tinkering with computers in Cold War Taiwan, 1959–1984",Contemporary,"This dissertation uses a developing country's appropriation of mainframe computers, minicomputers, and microcomputers as a lens for understanding the historical relationships between the digital electronic computing technology, the development discourse underlying the Cold War, and the international exchanges of scientific and technological expertise in the context of the Cold War. It asks why and how, during the Cold War, Taiwanese scientists, engineers, technocrats, and ordinary users—all in a so-called developing country—introduced digital electronic computing to Taiwan and later built computers there. To answer the why question, I argue that these social groups' perceptions of Taiwan's developmental status shaped their perceptions of the importance of possessing, using, and manufacturing computers. As for the how question, I propose that Taiwanese computer users modeled their practices after the existing successful practices of using mainframe computers and later started to build and tinker with minicomputers and microcomputers. The beginning chapter of this dissertation discusses that a group of Taiwanese engineers, technocrats, and scientists advocated the introduction of ‘electronics science’ and digital electronic computing from the United States to Taiwan for expanding the industrial sector of Taiwan's economy in the late 1950s. Their efforts resulted in a UN technical-aid program, in which National Chiao-Tung University's (NCTU) professors, students, and technicians worked with two US visiting professors to set up a computing center, equipped with an IBM 650 and an IBM 1620 computer, at the NCTU campus from 1962 to 1964 (chapter 3). Chapter 4 analyzes how, in 1964, a Cornell econometrician relied on NCTU's 1620 computer to form an economic-planning project for a Taiwanese government agency. Chapter 5 discusses a project in which a NCTU graduate program planned to build a minicomputer from scratch from 1968 to 1971, despite being able to buy a minicomputer from various US suppliers. Chapter 6 explores two intriguing phenomena that surfaced between 1980 and 1984: why many of Taiwan's computer users preferred to build their own microcomputers and how this preference initiated a series of debates about whether legal institutions allowed Taiwanese companies to make Apple compatibles.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,Cornell University,NA,NA,"History, Modern history, Science history, China, Cold War, Computers, Development discourse, Digital electronic computing, History of technology, Taiwan",21,Ithaca,New York,42.4442,-76.5032,United States

(Volumes I and II),Contemporary,"Based on an analysis of political and socioeconomic structures in pre-Cultural Revolution China (1949-65), this study attempts to account for patterns of political conflicts in the course of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76). Rather than attributing the unprecedented turbulence of the decade merely to Mao Zedong, a charismatic leader, and a handful of his close associates who inhabited the misty regions at the very top of China's political pyramid, it focuses on such questions as why millions of people participated in the movement, why they tended to behave in certain ways rather than in others, and what their relations were with Mao, and how they affected the process of the movement? It concludes that the Cultural Revolution, as one of the most extraordinary and puzzling events of the twentieth century, did not spring full-blown from anyone's brow. Although Mao appears to have fathered it, various groups within the elite, the middle levels of power, and particularly the masses, for their own reasons, contributed to its development and to its consequences. This study is concerned mainly with one city, Wuhan, an industrial city with about 3 million population located in the central China. The materials presented in this study derive from six main sources: the author's own recollection of the ten years of the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. his diary and personal correspondence with friends during the decade. national and local official publications. national and local publications run by mass organizations between 1966 and 1969. local archives. and, finally and most importantly, interview data.

This examination of the American Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) mission in China indicates that before the mid 1920s, even if there were an interest in indigenizing the church in China, there were more forces acting against the process than encouraging it. Among the negative forces were: the lack of any clear-cut MEC indigenization policy, the emphasis on the social gospel in which building institutions and addressing social and health problems overshadowed evangelization goals, the distrust among the leadership of the China Mission that the Chinese were ready to take over the new Church, the emphasis on self-support as the first criterion of indigenization, and a plethora of organizational and other critical ecclesiastical matters that diverted the attention of MEC leaders from the fundamental goal of its mission effort. When funding of the missions dried up beginning in the early 1920s. and anti-westernism and anti-Christianity forced missionaries out of China in the mid to late 1920s. the MEC was forced to hand over the new Church to the Chinese converts who had been seeking control for almost forty years.",2006,2006,D.Litt.,United States,Drew University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, American history, Board of Foreign Missions, China, Indigenization, Methodist Episcopal, Nineteen 20s",2,Madison,New Jersey,40.7586,-74.4169,United States

Concentrating on the first stage of indigenization, the institutional and administrative changes in American Methodist China missions, the time span of this project is from the 1880s, when Chinese Methodists of most regional American Methodist China missions initially practiced the principle of self-support, until the 1920s, when the increase of Chinese Methodist leaders concurred with the decrease of Western missionaries and the first Chinese bishop was elected. Through examining this period of history, this project suggests that viewing the history of foreign missions from the process of indigenization may provide a more inclusive perspective, giving crucial issues, such as modernization and imperialism, the proper places in the formation of autonomous, postcolonial Chinese Christianity. Thus, this dissertation project attempts to provide an alternative interpretation of the indigenization of Chinese Christianity, suggesting that the buildup of selfhood of Chinese Christianity is not the dilemma of one more Christian, one less Chinese, but the Christian interconnectedness of Western and Chinese cultures. For the advancement of indigenization, imperialism and modernization, mainly via education, were both crucial to the progress of ecclesial indigenization. While modern education prepared Chinese Methodist leaders for the day of autonomy, Western imperialism gave the Chinese a reason to arrive at a nationalist consensuses and the formulation of Chinese churches. Therefore, through evaluating the achievements of indigenization, this dissertation articulates that Chinese Methodism is a Chinese Christian community with cultural hybridity, such that the indigenization of American Methodist missions in China paved the way toward a postcolonial Christianity that would continuously interact with Chinese and Western cultures.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Drew University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Modern history, American Methodism, China, Chinese Methodism, Christianity, Imperialism, Indigenization, Methodist, Mission history, Modernization, Postcolonial, Postcolonial Christianity",2,Madison,New Jersey,40.7586,-74.4169,United States
304994269,"Kim, Sunkyung","Decline of the Law, death of the monk: Buddhist texts and images in the Anyang Caves of late sixth-century China",Pre-modern,"This dissertation explores how cave sanctuaries in sixth century China became the center stage for the public assertion of spiritual legitimacy in the age of mofa , the period of the Buddhist temporal scheme known as the Decline of the Law. Constructed during one of the most tumultuous periods in Chinese history, the Anyang Caves operated as a visual memento of the mofa ideology and an embodiment of the monastic ideals of both life and death for such celebrated monastic elites as Daoping (d. 559), Sengchou (480-560) and Lingyu (518-605). As a retreat to return to after declining imperial invitations and as a burial site, the Anyang Caves and their mountainous setting incarnated an idealized notion of monastics, a collective concept recapitulated in the biography of eminent monks. Through the activity of carving not only sutra passages but also the most innovative imagery of the time, the Anyang Caves challenge the prevailing canon of knowledge regarding Chinese Buddhist caves in the field of art history. By analyzing contemporaneous textual documents, visual materials and their interrelationship, this study has shown how these caves stand as a surprisingly complex and layered site of meaning, most specifically as an exemplary case showing how a conventional changuanku or a meditation-visualization cave incorporated a variety of visual experiences, repentance rituals, and mortuary practices while also serving as an efficient device for asserting a rhetorical claim of spiritual and doctrinal orthodoxy.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,Duke University,NA,NA,"Art history, History, Religious history, Anyang Caves, Buddhist, China, Decline of the Law, Meditation caves, Mortuary practice, Sixth century",6,Durham,North Carolina,35.9792,-78.9022,United States
303953874,"Tang, Xiaobing",Writing a history of modernity: A study of the historical consciousness of Liang Ch'i-ch'ao,Contemporary,"The present study of Liang Ch'i-ch'ao (1873-1929), arguably the first modern Chinese historian, bases itself on the theoretical proposition that essential to and symptomatic of the experience of modernity is a primal cognitive diremption, or an encounter with a different other, be it Nature, the New World, the irrational, or the past. While on the one hand this recognized presence of the other gives rise to various discourses of differentiation, such as history, ethnography, and archaeology, on the other hand it inevitably entails a relationship of domination and a constitutive centrism. In the Hegelian--in effect the hegemonic modernist/rationalist--tradition of historical conception, for instance, there is an almost ontological imperative to project a homogeneous chronological flow of time in order to legitimize modernity as both necessary and rational. Temporality first subordinates and then unifies a multidimensional global space. The central problem for Liang Ch'i-ch'ao, situated in the margin of modernity, became how to achieve a historical configuration that would integrate China into the progressive modern world and at the same time maintain an irreducible indigenous identity. These two distinct historiographical urges, the need to accept a universal time vis-a-vis the desire to operate in an authentic regional space, the Enlightenment longing for systematization versus the equally modernist pursuit for individualized articulation, form the driving force behind Liang's historical imagination. Through an interdisciplinary approach and discourse analysis, this dissertation critically examines several major texts produced by the historian over a quarter of a century, in particular his writings on a nationalist historiography, the possibility of a total revolution, and cultural politics and strategies. It intends to show that the modern difficulty of confronting the other was grasped by Liang Ch'i-ch'ao as an intersubjective tension that eventually demanded a reconceptualization of history in terms of a spatialized simultaneity. As a rediscovered experiential dimension, spatiality or historio-geography compelled him to reimagine the project of modernity and for that reason, his reexamination of modern history and his own historiographical methodology remain profoundly pertinent and provocative in our present time.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,Duke University,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, China",6,Durham,North Carolina,35.9792,-78.9022,United States
305324971,"Luo, Xiaoxiang","From imperial city to cosmopolitan metropolis: Culture, politics and state in late Ming Nanjing",Modern,"This study examines the urban life of Nanjing, the southern capital of Ming (1368-1644) China, in the last decades before the Ming-Qing transition. Through close readings of local gazetteers, official documents, private collections, correspondences of missionaries, popular prints, and other visual materials, my research investigates the characteristics of urban culture and politics of Nanjing against the unique socio-political background of late Ming China. Although taking urban culture and politics as the point of departure, this study methodologically differs from previous discussions on the subject. Instead of following the traditional approach of interpreting the link between the late Ming market economy and its consequent impact on the mental and cultural world of contemporary Chinese, this research emphasizes factors of administrative function, ceremonial symbolism, and institutional facilities in shaping the urban life and politics. In general, issues under investigation fall under three major questions: What factors promoted the urban development? What was the nature of urban life and administration? And what was the city's function within the regional urban network? This dissertation demonstrates that, as a major administrative and political center under direct governing of the central government, the city of Nanjing was not a mere administrative tool. Instead, it had a very energetic political culture and played an active role in the state life. Its urban history exposes some basic problems in the relationship between local history and the history of the state. Second, late Ming Nanjing showed strong ability to incorporate new social and political elements of a changing world into its life. To some extent, it was more open to new cultural and political possibilities than were the other provincial and economically-developed towns and cities.

305329636,"Kim, Seonmin","Borders and crossings: Trade, diplomacy and ginseng between Qing China and Choson Korea",Modern,"This dissertation analyzes a 1685 border trespassing case and its outcome in the broad context of the Qing empire building process in Manchuria, examining its impact on the border negotiations with the Choson court and the formation of trading networks in Manchuria involving Korean merchants. It argues that Manchuria and Choson Korea were the two markers of the Qing empire building in the sense that the transition from the Ming to the Qing first began in this vital frontier and was completed here through the transformation of the Manchu relationship to the Choson court. The visible intersection of these two markers is the ginseng that grew in the borderland between China and Korea. As the Manchus became serious contenders for power in Manchuria, they began to enforce Manchu superiority over the Koreans and claim sole ownership of ginseng in the borderland. These two endeavors were all against Korean views, in that the Koreans believed the Manchus were inferior in every sense and the ginseng in the borderland had long been a shared resource. The Changbaishan investigation in 1712 shows that the Qing continually sought to achieve two goals—the imposition of Qing superiority and the making of the territorial boundary—in their relationship to the Choson court even after the two military campaigns. In this sense, Qing empire building was still in progress in the northeast until the early eighteenth century. The significance of Choson Korea to the Qing empire was not limited to its geographical proximity and long neighborly relations. The Korean neighbors also contributed to the development of the regional economy of Manchuria through border markets and private trade followed by tributary missions. While tribute exchanges held at the courts in Beijing and Shengjing signified the Korean submission to Qing power, private trade between Korean traders and their Chinese partners were linking the northeastern frontier into the broader regional economy in East Asia. Ginseng and silver exchanges through the hands of Korean traders also commercially connected Qing Manchuria to Japan via Korea. As long as these Korean traders contributed to the regional economy of Manchuria, the Qing authorities were willing to ignore all the troubles that Korean visitors caused in their territory. Through commercial relations, Choson Korea played a crucial role in the Qing empire building in Manchuria.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Duke University,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, China, Choson, Diplomacy, Ginseng, Korea, Qing dynasty, Trade",6,Durham,North Carolina,35.9792,-78.9022,United States
304502600,"Hwang, Dongyoun","Wang Jingwei, the Nanjing government and the problem of collaboration",Contemporary,"This dissertation seeks to go beyond labels of treachery to examine the ideological motivations of Wang Jingwei's collaboration with Japan during the anti-Japanese War (1937–1945). As a point of departure, I argue that everyone in China at the time was a collaborator—Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) with the United States, the Chinese Communists with the Soviet Union, and Wang with Japan—and that particular collaboration was a product of a particular vision of the nation. Suggesting that Wang needs to be understood as a figure in history, rather than, as he is generally seen, a villain in a morality play, I argue that the label of “ hanjian ” (“traitor”) that is usually applied to him must be seen as a term in the rhetoric of power that legitimates other ideologies. This dissertation shows that Wang's version of nationalism was radically different from that of those who insisted on resistance. First, Wang was concerned more about people and their livelihood as well as the nation than about the state itself (the National Government under Jiang Jieshi) in his decision for collaboration. Second, Wang's nationalism was, according to him, compatible with Greater Asianism ( dayazhou zhuyi ), which had its origins in Sun Zhongshan's Pan-Asian idea that was shared and echoed by both the Chinese and the Japanese at the turn of the century. Third, anti-Communism was a crucial issue in Wang's version of nationalism. Thus in his collaboration, Wang, a major figure of the non-Communist Leftists, placed the Communist issue at the center of his dissatisfaction with the state. Considering the complexities of Chinese nationalism in the 1930s, this study places Wang and his associates in the vortex of the complex and diverse politics of China in the war. As the war with Japan proceeded, their anxieties over national extinction escalated into activism in order to propose and implement their own vision of saving the nation, promoting a new GMD, and creating a new China. They projected their vision into the future of an industrialized and independent nation, and willingly compromised their ideas for saving and reconstructing the nation to meet immediate needs. Collaboration with Japan, rather than resistance, provided Wang and his colleagues with a way to save, reconstruct, develop, and strengthen China in the particular period, when the existing state failed to do so.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Duke University,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, Political science, China, Collaboration, Japan, Nationalism, Soviet Union, Wang Jingwei",6,Durham,North Carolina,35.9792,-78.9022,United States
2679276616,"Sun, Zexi (Jesse)","War, Revolution, and Chinese Protestant Intellectuals: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey",Contemporary,"In keeping with the recent paradigm shift, this dissertation approaches the indigenization of Christianity in China from a different perspective. Rather than conceiving indigenization as the devolution of missionary power to indigenous leaders, the study focuses on the emergence of Chinese Protestant intellectuals and their ability to engage the public space—how they have historically engaged their religious tradition to address the broader public during crises. It does so by examining the lives and works of several Chinese Christian intellectuals as they negotiated with the most transformative events in twentieth-century Chinese history: modernizing reforms in the 1910s and 1920s, prolonged resistance against the Japanese invasion in the 1930s and 1940s, and ideological domestication after 1950. With transnational and indigenous resources, these people created a captivating vision of national salvation for their country. The first three chapters of this work reconstruct the intellectual development among mainstream Chinese Protestants in Republican China by tracing the rise and unraveling of the liberal consensus that integrated three spheres of emphasis in Christianity to lead China in progress. Such endeavor offered an inspiring message of national salvation by individual moral improvement, social implementation of reformist ministries, and transcendence of national boundaries for world solidarity. However, starting in the 1930s, a group of Christian intellectuals’ continued exploration led to increasing ideological affinity to socialism and organizational closeness to the Chinese Communist Party. Meanwhile, another group turned to conservative theology and began to advocate for a national as well as spiritual deliverance that could not be reduced to morality and social service. The last three chapters document these Christian intellectuals’ response to an unprecedented challenge: a centralized and ideologically charged state. During the Civil War, the Christian socialists saw the Communist triumph as an eschatological victory of “light” over “darkness,” while the conservative group struggled to create Christianity’s continuing relevance in China. Despite their adaptability and courage in the early 1950s, the totalitarian regime soon engulfed public space, and these intellectuals found themselves marginalized through either bureaucratization or exile, thwarting their nation-saving longings. Failing to achieve the public intellectual mission haunted them in their last years. It also prompted many to return to the Christian faith as they tried to reorient themselves to China’s unfinished quest for modernization, which seemed yet to reveal its hidden directions. Overall, English monographs on Chinese Protestant intellectuals are few. This dissertation aims to narrate a story of the intellectual odyssey of Chinese Protestantism in the twentieth century, from the birth of Republican China in 1911 through the height of ideological fanaticism in the Cultural Revolution. Using case studies, the dissertation shows that the evolving perspectives of these Christian intellectuals have never escaped the gravitational pull of the grand narrative of national salvation, for which they infused highly transnational influences into active public engagement. Eventually, despite seemingly within the seekers’ grasp, the vision of deliverance proved fleeting as it became co-opted by the power of the state, yet without failing to throw subsequent followers into new cycles of hope and violence propelled by the ever-present pressures for change.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,Duke University,Religion,Religious Studies,NA,6,Durham,North Carolina,35.9792,-78.9022,United States
879787195,"Zhou, Haipeng",Expressions of the Life that is within Us Epistolary Practice of American Women in Republican China,Contemporary,"Reciprocal exchanges, interactions that influence a person's life and development, are the focus of my dissertation on a group of progressive American women. Among them are Ida Pruitt, Helen Snow, and Maud Russell, who stayed in China in the 1920s and 1930s, engaging in various progressive activities as social worker, YWCA secretary and independent journalist respectively. Letter writing and reading was an indispensable part of their life in China. It served as a vital link between their diverse Chinese experience and American homeland, it set up a free stage for these letter writers to create and perform various selves, it served as a key factor to define the letter writers' sense of community, and it provided a unique lens to see a transnational history with emphasis on gender and race. The purpose of this project is to unravel the significance of the discursive epistolary practice of these women. It examines through epistolary representations the internal and external standards in evaluating women's new and traditional roles in this historical period. More specifically, my dissertation will focus on four key themes: progressive American women's community in China, their self-representation of changing personas and selves in reaction to various external values, the influence of their letter writing on the perception of China in the US, and the impact of their epistolary practice on international feminist practices and cross-cultural understanding. To explore these themes, I investigate the foreign community in China and its epistolary culture in general, as well as conduct specific case studies. I argue that the epistolary legacies left by these middle-class American women open new windows to see the past from an enlightening perspective. They demonstrate that individuals' experience can break through ideological barriers and influence imbalance among big territorial powers.

875962580,"Carlson, Joana Renee","Blurring the boundaries of Cold War foreign relations: Popular diplomacy, transnationalism, and U.S. policy toward post-revolutionary China and Cuba",Contemporary,"This study presents a comparison of U.S. policy toward Greater China and Cuba, but more importantly, investigates the epistemology that underlies the development of U.S. Cold War foreign policy. This study illustrates how average people in the United States, Greater China, and Cuba worked with and against the media and their respective governments to actualize changes in U.S. foreign policy between the late 1940s and the late 1970s. By focusing on incremental changes in the American worldview, I will introduce significant events and factors that enabled American citizens and policymakers to take steps toward normalization with Mainland China in 1972 while maintaining the trade embargo against Cuba to the present. The relationship between popular opinion, media representation, and official policymaking is pivotal. Experiences, whether personal or collective, influence decisions—and collective national experiences (which shape or are shaped by the way the media reports a story) coalesce to form popular opinion, which in turn helps to direct national and international policy trends. Rather than emphasizing the roles of diplomats and world leaders, this analysis will show the complex interactions between citizens, media, and government, and the ways in which each group exercises its power differently. By asserting that policymakers were acutely aware of the importance of public opinion and recognized the limitations that popular diplomacy placed on traditional foreign relations, this work underscores the role of average individuals who influenced policymaking—regardless of whether they realized it at the time, or even in retrospect. These citizens, whose ranks include immigrants, soldiers, spies, students, journalists, translators, and protesters, shaped the parameters of international diplomacy within their own nations as well as abroad. This work will highlight the ways in which American, Chinese, and Cuban citizens at home and abroad have conceived of their national and individual roles in 20 th century history, as well as how these preconceptions have had a powerful effect on international diplomacy. Especially noteworthy are the ways in which different groups of citizens participated in and intuited mass mobilizations throughout the 1950s and 1960s and the acceptable role of the individual in different societies. These responses help to explain the degree to which citizens emphasize the agency of individuals over that of the state, as well as the rationale behind these views. By utilizing political psychology, transnationalism, and subaltern studies to examine the power relationships among citizens, media, and political leaders in the U.S., Greater China, and Cuba, this study brings an integrative and personal perspective to Cold War studies. I argue that these lines of theory contribute to the formation of an epistemological structure which historians can implement to examine not only changes that foreign policy has undergone, but also how individuals form their ideas about the world and the ways in which these perspectives form the basis for the creation and transformation of foreign policy. This study contends that cyclical, systematic transformations in individuals’ understanding of the world around them are crucial to understanding foreign policy shifts undertaken at any level of society. By comparing U.S. policy toward Greater China and Cuba and combining several schools of theory to explain multilevel power negotiations in foreign policy, this study makes several important contributions to the existing literature. First, I examine how the collective national memories, shaped by interactions in the century prior to the Cold War, influenced post-Cold War issues in Sino-American (both Nationalist and Communist) and U.S.-Cuban relations. Second, through an assessment of transnational subalterity, I introduce the “pseudo-subaltern” subject, who despite his or her traditionally dominant position, adopts a new role in transnational society and learns to utilize methods of power generally reserved for marginalized groups. Third, I look at Americans’ belief in the “freedom to travel” to Mainland China and Cuba and “freedom of information” about these nations, and how forms of resistance and civil disobedience in countering what some believed were anti-American restrictions resulted in changes in foreign policy. Fourth, I incorporate power negotiations between Chinese and Cuban immigrants and U.S. immigration officials to demonstrate that these ethnic interest groups not only helped to shape immigration policy, but also influenced international relations in a comprehensive way. Fifth, I argue that American veterans and former POWs of the Korean War played a more significant role in the Civil Rights Movement and anti-Vietnam sentiment than existing scholarship shows. Finally, I use political, cultural, and psychological rationale to explain why Americans distanced themselves from Taiwan by the early 1970s, opened dialogue with the Chinese communists, and expected and then avoided normalization of relations with Cuba. I argue that the epistemological structure that shaped the transformation of perspective in foreign relations become imperative in understanding the changing goals of foreign policymaking.

I propose a new definition for censorship by arguing that censorship, as an integral part of hegemony, rules art works not only by repressing, but also by producing its own discourse that influences the authors, artworks and the public opinions. Based on the new definition, I study the scope, efficacy, mechanism of censorship and its impact on the subject being censored. Then the dissertation reviews the changes in Chinese film censorship after the Cultural Revolution. I argue that the Chinese film censorship after 1976 undertakes a new task of defending the CCP's ideological governance and ensuring the development of Chinese film industry. The censorship's new objective determines the outlook of Chinese cinema. After that, the dissertation examines the impact of Chinese film censorship on Chinese cinema with three case studies, including films concerning politically sensitive topics, the state sponsored leitmotif film and the entertainment film exemplified by the Chinese wuxia, or the action film.

Promoting Western ideals and modernity over established Chinese ethics and traditions, the proponents of this movement sought to correct the failures of the 1911 Revolution, which, instead of introducing real political and social reform, had only ushered in an era of chaos under the rule of a defunct central government and powerful provincial warlords. As these New Culture intellectuals grew increasingly more nationalistic, especially following the “May Fourth incident” of 1919, their movement also acquired a strong anti-imperialist stance toward those elements of foreign domination and control which had infiltrated China during the last few decades of the Ch'ing dynasty, and still remained. In particular, Christian educational institutions received strong criticism and opposition as extensions of Western imperialism. This dissertation examines the relationship between American teachers and Chinese students at one of these institutions, Yale-in-China in the province of Hunan, during this pivotal period in modern Chinese history. Though many contemporary historians of the Christian missionary experience in China have tended to portray the relationship between Western educators and their Chinese students at Christian institutions during this period as being increasingly irreconcilable due to the unyielding attitudes and policies of the former in response to the growing consciousness and activism of the latter, this dissertation presents a remarkably different scenario at Yale-in-China. Rather than becoming diametrically opposed to one another, the American faculty and Chinese students at Yale-in-China, especially during the early years of the New Culture movement, developed a relationship of compromise and cooperation. Through looking at the manner in which this positive relationship led the Yale-in-China educational missionaries to respond to their students' calls for change with various enlightened accommodations, this dissertation provides a new perspective on student - teacher relations in Christian institutions in China during this period.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Florida State University,NA,NA,"History, Education history, China, Missionaries, New Culture movement, Student consciousness, Yale-in-China",4,Tallahassee,Florida,30.4551,-84.2527,United States

After World War II, mainland China experienced a successful revolution and change of government, placing the power of the world's most populous nation in the hands of Communist leadership. Region wide, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet bloc necessitated that Hong Kong steer a narrow diplomatic course to insure survival. Conditions arising out of the uncertainty on the mainland posed larger challenges and even greater opportunities for the colony. From 1949 through the first half of 1950, Hong Kong's population doubled and made the Hong Kong government re-examine its basic social and economic structure. This population increase, coupled with the Cold War relationship between China and the West set the colony on a path to determine a definition of citizenship within Hong Kong. By identifying who belonged within the colony, the government recognized that it had a responsibility to its citizens to provide basic services. This represented a gradual abandonment of Hong Kong's overall laissez faire policies. Most notably the government departed from their traditional stance to provide low cost housing for refugees and indigent poor. Hong Kong also created new bureaucratic departments to meet other social welfare needs of its population. While the refugees seemed to give the government a set of problems that could be seen as almost insurmountable, they also provided Hong Kong with its greatest resource. Many of the refugees brought capital for investment in their new home as well as industrial expertise and willingness to gamble and work hard. This became the basis for the transformation of Hong Kong's economy into an industrial and manufacturing power house which became the envy of Asia and the world.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Florida State University,NA,NA,"History, Public administration, China, Colonial government, Hong Kong, Industrial development, Postwar, Social welfare",4,Tallahassee,Florida,30.4551,-84.2527,United States

The Amis tribe is descended from immigrants from China and/or Southeast Asia, dating as far back as 1,500 B.C. Conversion to Christ among members of this community began in 1934 and mushroomed after the end of World War II. In 1982 Fataan Presbyterian Church experienced revitalization through the influence of the Central Full Gospel Church in Seoul, Korea, and the Miaoli Prayer Mountain in Taiwan. This study seeks to trace the historical, sociological, and theological forces which prepared the Amis at Fataan for conversion. Persons who became leaders of the Fataan Church are introduced, together with their successes and failures and the impact they had upon their community and others. Through interviews and library sources this paper traces the events of the sixty year history of this congregation: (1) Persecution during the Japanese period. (2) Conflict with indigenous cultural practices and power encounters which demonstrated Christianity's superiority. (3) Conflict with the Roman Catholic Church. (4) Spread ofthe Gospel among all ages. (5) Industrialization, acculturation, and out-migration of youth. (6) Disillusionment and searching for renewal.

304663170,"Petzholt, Raymond Paul",China's ancient monotheistic religious roots in Shang Ti and its importance for the evangelization of the Chinese,Contemporary,Our thesis is that the worship of Shang Ti or Heaven in ancient China was monotheistic in nature and was indeed their general revelation of the one true God of Christianity and Judiaism. In the past century a large body of research by anthropologists and missiologists has brought to light much exciting information about the worldwide “Sky God” or “High God” phenomena. We show how that research supports our thesis. A foundation is laid for our thesis by documentating how a researcher's worldview often leads to biased conclusions. This helps explain why we find many conflicting views concerning the origin and nature of China's ancient religious beliefs. We give evidence to show that the Judeo-Christian biblical worldview best explains and interprets all the facts. We then chart the attributes of “Sky God” as they are revealed through general revelation around the world. These charts are then compared with the attributes of Jehovah and Jesus as revealed in the special revelation of the Bible. The comparison shows we are dealing with the same God in both revelations. We then document the attributes of Shang Ti from the Chinese classics to understand who they originally believed Shang Ti to be. These attributes are compared with the attributes of God revealed in general and special revelation. It becomes evident that Shang Ti is the same God revealed in the Bible. We strengthen our thesis by documenting the many similarities between the law in the Bible and the law in the Li Ki of China. This demonstrates the similarities in their underlying moral principles and points to a common source in the same God. The defence of the thesis is then concluded with a comparison of blood covenant in China with covenants found in the Bible and around the world. We discover a powerful lesson that will enable the Chinese to understand the spiritual implications of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.

Many firmly believe that God has blessed them through jade business for their faithfulness. Their religious traditional belief in Hpan Wa Ningsang Chye Wa Ningchyang One who creates, One who knows, had been an early factor that prepared them for Christianity. The Kachin Baptist Church emerged out of the selfless commitment of the American missionaries and the Karen pioneer missionary partners who are culturally quite different and yet whose traditional concepts and life style are quite similar to the Kachins. Due to their inspiring evangelistic message, the baptism of seven people formally originated the Kachin Baptist Church. The significant factors that facilitate the growth and maturity of the church are the awareness of the need for transformational change, education, literature, evangelism, the participation of the Karen missionaries, and finally the leadership of the Kachins themselves. Like the Karens, the Kachin Baptist Church has been engaged in an evangelistic outreach among the Kachins residing in Yunan, China since their golden jubilee in 1927. A similar outreach was started among the Palawngs and Nagas in the 1950s. The baptism of 6,214 new converts during the centennial celebration in 1977 was a monumental mark for the Kachins and for the Baptist world. The unforgettable mission campaign, called 300 for 3 years mission, was created and carried out joyfully in gratitude for God's providential care, and its results are immeasurable. To the Kachins, history and traditions are of great importance due to the cohesiveness of the kinship system.

917227634,"Arentz, Jason","The political economy of autocracy: Insights from economic theory, analytical history and the experimental laboratory",Contemporary,"This dissertation coordinates multiple methodologies and lines of research with the goal of understanding power and autocracy. I present here results and insights from theory, experiments, and analytical history. In my first chapter, I construct a public choice model of autocracy inspired by the seminal contributions of Gordon Tullock (1980) and most especially by Ronald Wintrobe (1998). By focusing attention primarily on autocratic expenditures – the actual variables of choice – I uncover internal equilibria that differ, sometimes significantly, from those uncovered by Ronald Wintrobe's four models. I also identify and resolve a few relevant ambiguities. The comparative statics regarding autocratic responses to external economic shocks for the most part qualitatively conform to those identified by Ronald Wintrobe, with the important exception of the tinpot-dictatorship model. This paper should add to the seminal work of Ronald Wintrobe to provide a powerful theoretical basis for empirical research into the behavior of autocratic regimes. My second chapter presents the first direct laboratory test of selectorate theory. Selectorate theory uses the relative size of the minimum winning coalition to predict the behavior of autocrats and other political leaders, based on the logic of political survival. To test this theory, I designed an experiment with two treatments that differed only in the institutional variable of minimum winning coalition size. I report here two main results. First, consistent with the theory, smaller minimum winning coalition systems lead to greater kleptocracy and regime longevity. Second, contrary to the theory, I find no evidence that leaders increased public goods spending when the minimum winning coalition size increased. Since public goods helped secure support from out-group selectors, participant “leaders” viewed public goods as insurance against coalition defectors. However, when minimum coalitions were large, competition from the challenger was fiercer, so the “insurance”, like kleptocracy, was a luxury they could not afford. In chapter three, I introduce selectorate heterogeneity into the model. By doing so, I am able to endogenize the size of the minimum winning coalition on the basis of the distribution of power. Therefore, while a small coalition from the population might exert authority over the majority, it must specifically contain the most powerful individuals to do so. I find that if the assumption of uniform payments is maintained, then the autocrat will prefer the wining coalition with the smallest number of members. If uniformity is relaxed, then the autocrat can manage with many different compositions. However, if information and transaction costs are salient, then the dictator will choose compositions with fewer members. This expansion to the standard selectorate model renders the theory closer to real world examples, and therefore more useful as a tool for critical case studies. In chapter four I apply the theories to case studies in Stalinist USSR, from 1921 to 1956. I find that both theoretical frameworks provide useful tools for deepening our understanding of the key moments under consideration. I find that the dominant factors are the increasing level of productive capacity available to Stalin, and the increasing concentration of his minimum winning coalition. Stalin's personality aligned closely with the utility functions used by the theories. However, the historic implementation of repression and loyalty required more careful consideration and exploration. I find that Stalin's power grew continuously through his reign, becoming tyrannical around 1931 at the onset of the Holodomor, and tipping into totalitarianism in the late thirties with the Great Purge. My fifth chapter repeats the process for case studies in Maoist China. Again, access to productive capacity dominated Mao's political cycle. His power grew after the founding of the People Republic of China until he was surprised by the catastrophic failure of the Great Leap Forward, late in 1959.

2717075778,"Ho, Kaman","The Mongol Conquest, State Capacity, and Historical Stagnation of Imperial China",Medieval,"This dissertation is divided into three chapters about the Mongol conquest of China (1205–1279 AD). The Mongol conquest of China continued to have persistent negative effects on long-term development, even centuries after the war. Using newly assembled war, population, and 16th century county-level agricultural data, I show that regions that were more severely impacted by the conquest are associated with lower granary storage, indicating lower levels of productivity. Regional differences in state capacity are the channels of stagnation. In counties where the conquest lasted longer, the government collected less land tax. The Malthusian mechanism, in contrast to state capacity, does not explain the long-term economic outcomes of China after the Mongol conquest. The first chapter documents the literature and the historical and institutional background of the Mongol Conquest of China. The Mongol conquest was in effect a global conflict launched in the Old World by a single family, that of Genghis Khan. The 13th–16th century was a critical period for the emergence of the West from the rest of the world. A careful investigation of the persistent negative effects of the Mongol Conquest is crucial in explaining comparative development between Asia and Europe. By analyzing the economic, political, and social differences in the Chinese dynasties before and after the Mongol Conquest, the long-term development of Imperial China sheds light on how negative shocks in the past shaped economic and political outcomes. The second chapter studies the effects of the Mongol Conquest and the mechanisms of transition. Using fixed-effects models, I show that an additional year of war is associated with a 1.58–2.8% decrease in granary levels. The Mongols intentionally targeted more developed areas in the conquest. Correcting for potential biases, the results of instrumental variable analyses report that granary storage drop from 18.7% to 56.7% with an additional year of war. In particular, I am able to examine two mechanisms of transition—state capacity and the Malthusian mechanism. If the Malthusian mechanism were applied, the population would have recovered in the 16th century. I discover that a longer war duration in the 13th century was associated with lower agricultural productivity, which was later measured by granary storage in the 16th century. As the transition channel, regional differences in state capacity explains lower productivity centuries after the war; but the Malthusian mechanism does not. The granary system is an important historical infrastructure of China for the relief of famines. Areas that were more negatively affected by the conquest had lower state capacity; that is, the government collected less land tax. With less tax, the granary system was not well maintained. When famines occurred, the population and productivity in these areas decreased substantially compared to other areas. The alignment of evidence from OLS models, fixed effects, and instrumental variable analyses suggests that the relationship between Mongol conquest and long-term development is likely causal. The third chapter explores similarities between Imperial China after the Mongol Conquest and modern China. China has adopted more characteristics of an Inner Asian empire after the Mongol Conquest—that is, a static, inward, and non-competitive state. The Belt and Road Initiative, internal circulation, flexible employment, grid-style social management, and the Hukou system in the People’s Republic of China can all be traced back to the corresponding archetypes in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD). By comparing institution, policy, and social control between the Ming dynasty and modern China, I argue that the negative effects of the Mongol Conquest of China persist to this day.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,George Mason University,Economics,Economics,NA,2,Fairfax,Virginia,38.8531,-77.2997,United States
304185059,"Heer, Paul James",George F. Kennan and U.S. foreign policy in East Asia,Contemporary,"Although widely recognized for his contributions to U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union and Western Europe in the years immediately following World War II, George F. Kennan, during the period that he served as director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff (1947-1950), was also deeply involved in the development of U.S. policy toward the Far East. In China, he was one of the primary architects of the State Department's policy of U.S. disengagement from involvement in the Chinese civil war. In Japan, he was the primary architect of the redirection of U.S. occupation policy away from demilitarization and toward economic and political reconstruction. Kennan had less success in his efforts to influence U.S. policy toward Korea and Indochina, but in both cases the government's neglect of his advice led to disastrous consequences: In the late summer of 1950, he was almost alone in warning against the crossing the 38th Parallel by U.S. forces in Korea, which provoked Chinese intervention in the war there. and, he was one of the first to warn against the U.S. military commitment in Southeast Asia, which ultimately led to the Vietnam War. Kennan's strategic approach to East Asia in the late 1940s was based largely on his judgement that the mainland of Asia was not strategically important to the United States, and thus that his doctrine of containment was not applicable there. Instead, Kennan viewed Japan as the strategic center of the Far East and saw its revitalization as the cornerstone of postwar U.S. policy in the region. His ideas on how to implement this strategic framework, however, were not always consistent, well developed, or politically feasible. In addition, his calculation of the strategic balance of power in Asia was, in some respects, uncharacteristically shortsighted. Kennan was never able to reconcile his assessment that the mainland of Asia was strategically expendable with his belief that the United States could not afford to sacrifice its prestige there. Nevertheless, many of the policies toward East Asia that Kennan personally developed and advocated--especially his focus on Japan--became key elements of Washington's overall approach to the region in the early postwar period. Moreover, even in those cases where his recommendations were rejected, subsequent events often demonstrated his prescience and the validity of his judgments. When viewed in its entirety, Kennan's record in East Asia is striking in the breadth and depth of his involvement, and in his level of success--especially for a policymaker who had virtually no expertise in Asian affairs.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,George Washington University,NA,NA,"American history, History, International law, International relations, Biographies, China, Japan, Kennan, George F.@, Korea, Vietnam",6,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
2031543339,"Yin, Qingfei","Confronting the Communist State: The Sino-Vietnamese Land-Maritime Border during the Cold War, 1949-1979",Contemporary,"This dissertation joins a vibrant conversation that explores Asia’s past from the point of view of its borderlands, which tend to be peripheral to the centers of state power while at the same time a prime locus for the enactment and realization of state authority. Willem Van Schendel’s work on Bengal borderlands (2004) and C. Patterson Giersch’s study of Qing conquest of the Tai domains of China’s Yunnan frontier (2006) both examine the ways that border-making of the central governments shaped the lives of borderlands residents. James C. Scott (2009), by contrast, emphasizes how borderlanders make their own history by evading and resisting the state in his study of Southeast Asian highlands. However, despite excellent works on state institutions and indigenous people at borderlands, scholars have not addressed how the broader international structure shaped boundary-making and border-crossing in Asia. Therefore, existing literature falls short in demonstrating how global trends affected local society at the political margins. This dissertation examines how the Cold War diplomacy and conflicts interplayed with the expansion and consolidation of modern states in the Sino-Vietnamese land-maritime border, which connected two communist countries. It fills the historiographical gap by linking international history, which typically focuses on high-level diplomacy, and borderlands history, which studies local society on the ground. Based on central and local level archival sources in Chinese and Vietnamese as well as western intelligence reports, this project analyzes how the concurrence of the nationalization of people and the internationalization of socialism shaped the boundary-making and state-building by the Chinese and Vietnamese communists at their shared borderlands and the Gulf of Tonkin. Driven by the forces of nation-building and socialist brotherhood, the Chinese and Vietnamese party-states collaborated in reorienting their respective people away from the border toward the central government while seeking to establish and perform a socialist partnership between the two countries at the border. As a result, the cross-border movement of people and goods became more visible, manipulable, and taxable to the communist states. The Indochina Wars, however, reversed the process of consolidation of state at the border by creating increased momentum for the spontaneous cross-border flows of people and goods that the modernizing states had to accommodate. The project makes three interdisciplinary contributions. First, while existing scholarship largely adopts a leadership-centered approach, I offer a border-focused yet transnational narrative of Sino-Vietnamese relations that clarifies the volatile bilateral relationship between the two Communist countries. Second, my project challenges established area studies methods, which typically begin with knowledge of national territories, instead emphasizing a “neighboring” effect on modern state-building. Third, the project contributes to the emerging field of borderlands studies in non-western context. It demonstrates that Communist institutions such as the state-planned economy and internal surveillance regime were effective tools for the political elites in post-colonial countries to nationalize the ethnic frontiers.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,George Washington University,History,History,"Asian History, Asian Studies, History, Border, China, Cold War, Maritime, State-building, Vietnam",6,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
1498550274,"Setzekorn, Eric","Professional hubris: Chinese officers, the United States and a failure of army building, 1942-1955",Contemporary,"The core historical argument presented in this dissertation is that Chinese military officers within the GMD military were able to create a depoliticized military institution, develop foreign partnerships and define a distinct military officer identity to create a true national army for the first time in Chinese history during the years 1942-1955. These normative ideas, expressed most articulately by General Sun Liren, were able to achieve many of the status objectives of military officers. The process by which Chinese military officers selectively adopted ideas that supported their professional claims to jurisdiction over the management of violence strongly supports the conception of normative isomorphism where change is driven by desires for status and respect. Chinese military officers built on fifty years of Chinese military thought and foreign ideas to develop a conception of a Chinese Army that was structured to represent aspirations of China as a world power. The aspirations of Chinese officers align closely with models of organizational theory that highlight enduring patterns of professional development and global military trends. Throughout this process, the Unites States played a key role in introducing concepts and providing support to military officers but was never able to decisively shape the GMD/ROC military. The failure of the Chinese army-building project was not due to a lack of organizational, intellectual or professional development but because of a renewed politicization of military forces and a purge of key military leaders in 1955. Ultimately, the power of ideas, be it ideas of professional competence articulated by Sun Liren or political loyalty developed by Chiang Ching-kuo, and the ability to mobilize supporters of these ideas mattered far more than foreign advice or equipment.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,George Washington University,History,History,"History, History, Military history, Army, China, Chinese officers, Military, Sun lijen, United states",6,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
304880258,"Russell, Matthew William",From imperial soldier to communist general: The early career of Zhu De and his influence on the formation of the Chinese Red Army,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the early career of Zhu De (1886-1976), the commander-in-chief of the Chinese Red Army, to provide a fuller perspective and better understanding of the origin and development of the early Red Army and ultimately why it was so successful. This army was a complex force that reflected an equally complex strategic, operational, and tactical heritage derived from a wide array of sources. Contrary to popular perceptions of the early Communist military operating mainly as guerrillas, the Red Army was, in reality, a hybrid force made up of regular troops, full-time guerrilla units, and local part-time self-defense forces. Its hybrid nature was also reflected in its operational style that combined conventional operations with guerrilla warfare. The military theory and operational concepts on which the Red Army relied were equally complex. While originating in military institutions and military theories that stretch back to the late Qing, they were equally affected by the military transformations of the early Chinese Republic and influenced by wider military developments in the world, especially in Japan, Germany, and Russia. By studying Zhu’s life and military background prior to 1927, this study has identified the varied antecedents to and influences on the Red Army and its operational concepts. The lessons and experiences Zhu derived from his service in the Yunnan Army from 1909 to 1922, clearly showed the influence of traditional Chinese military theory and practice, along with that of Western military models. Zhu was further influenced by his study of the German and Russian armies while he was in Europe from 1922 to 1926. It was Zhu who provided the bridge that spanned these different military traditions. Through his wide ranging and unique military experience and education, he could draw on these different military traditions and models and apply them to the development and operations of the Red Army. In the end, the key to the Red Army’s success was its adaptability and organizational flexibility in the face of different conditions and changing circumstances, where Zhu’s background would have been a great asset.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,George Washington University,History,History,"History, Modern history, Military history, China, Chu, Teh, Military, Red Army, Yunnan, Zhu, De",6,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
885429597,"Xiong, Yan",An Adventure In Cooperation: The Church of Christ in China and Church-State Relations in Nationalist China,Contemporary,"Beginning in the mid-1920s, the Chinese Nationalist Party (Guomindang/GMD), and the central government it established in 1927, were actively involved in anti-Christian activities in many parts of China. In the 1930s, though, the Church of Christ in China (CCC) joined other Chinese Christian organizations in organizing relief programs. Coming to appreciate the efforts of these Christian groups, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the GMD solicited their help more directly, initiating a change toward a more cooperative relationship with the Chinese Christian community. A main example of this new cooperation was the joint CCC-GMD effort, in December 1939, to establish the Border Service Department (BSD) to carry out medical and educational work in the Sichuan-Tibet-Xikang border areas. Funded by the central government but under the direct leadership of the CCC's General Assembly, the greater purpose of the BSD was to construct a solid anti-Japanese rear area in the Southwest, to improve the border peoples' livelihood, and to integrate these border peoples into the nation of China. While the BSD was successful in bringing many benefits to the border peoples, as a cooperative venture it also helped the government to achieve its broader goals for border construction ( bianjiang jianshe ) even as it provided opportunities for the CCC to evangelize among the border peoples. The successful cooperation between the CCC and the GMD in the BSD thus challenges the conventional understanding of the historic relationship between the Chinese state and religion as one of consistent hegemonic state dominance and manipulation.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,George Washington University,History,History,"Religious history, History, China, Christian mission in China, Christianity in China, Church of Christ, Church-state relations in republican China, Mission, Nation-building, State-church relations",6,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States

Its major contribution is that it is the first study to be written in English that draws extensively on Chinese language sources of information. In addition, it offers the most comprehensive knowledge about Chinese space activities, policies, decision-making, and space organization appearing outside of China. This study examines how the space program survived and thrived in these chaotic times, which included the Anti-Rightist campaign (1957), the Great Leap Forward (1958–9), mass starvation (1960–2), the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), and economic reform (after 1979). Two primary sources of success are identified: (1)&#xa0.The space program continually received support from the highest levels of government, no matter who was in charge—Mao Zedong at the outset, Zhou Enlai (the program's single most significant supporter) in 1956–76, Lin Biao in 1969–1971, the Gang of Four in 1971–1976, and Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng in 1983–1989. (2)&#xa0.The engineers, administrators, and workers in the space program—a highly talented and persistent lot consistently rose to whatever challenges they encountered. Chiefs among these were Marshal Nie Rongzhen, the program's political father, and Dr. Qian Xuesen, its technical father. Beyond these two important players, the second tier of leadership comprised primarily of Western-educated engineers, worked relentlessly to make the space program successful. Even rank-and-file engineers and technicians dedicated themselves selflessly to achieving the program's goals during dangerous period. The study is divided into two major parts. The first examines government policy toward the space program during 1956–1986, beginning with Mao Zedong's call to establish Big Science in China through Deng Xiaoping's initiative to reform the defense industry. The second looks at the evolution of the space agency organization during this same time period, highlighting the seminal efforts of key players such as Zhou Enlai, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, and Dr. Qian Xuesen, and emphasizing the responsiveness of the agency to deal with changes in its mission.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,George Washington University,NA,NA,"Science history, Political science, History, China, Policy, Space activities",6,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
2410000000,"Daniels, Joel David ",Does the Wind Bend or Break the Grass? A Comparative Study of Pentecostal Spirituality and Chinese Religious Thought,Contemporary,"The first Pentecostal missionaries arrived in China in 1907, bringing an affective, emotional, and experiential Christian spirituality with them. This small, Holy Spirit focused Christian movement quickly grew into an indigenous Christianity, leading some scholars to suggest that Chinese Christianity is inherently Pentecostal. Pentecostalism, which is the fastest growing religious movement in the world and is projected to reach 800 million members by 2025, appears to have its largest community within China now, claiming as many as one hundred million followers. How can this be? Why has the Chinese context been so receptive to Pentecostal spirituality? What has enabled Pentecostalism to thrive, particularly compared to other religious movements that have entered China? In this dissertation, I argue that two of the primary reasons why Pentecostal spirituality has flourished in China is that it (1) affirmed central values found in Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, while (2) harmonizing with Chinese “popular” religion practices, enabling Pentecostalism to take root in China. In other words, the Pentecostal spirituality propogated by missionaries, though unintentional, supported values embedded in Chinese culture through China’s religious heritage, exemplified in the texts Mengzi, Zhuangzi, and the Platform Sutra. My comparative analysis explores how these different religious values overlapped in important ways, and not how they were identical in the details. These shared values, however, only tell half the story––Pentecostal spiritual practice, which is Spirit (靈/灵) centered, accorded with Chinese religious practice. The congruence is particularly pronounced because Pentecostal missionaries were not educated on a normative expression of Pentecostal spirituality, largely because there is no normative Pentecostalism; thus, they included many supernatural and Spirit-centered practices as “Pentecostal.” Consequently, the Chinese people did not have to abandon their values or religious practices but rather simply reframe and bend them to a “new” source––the Holy Spirit (聖靈/圣灵). The result is a uniquely Chinese Pentecostalism that evades being reduced to “Western” models.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,Theological & Religious Studies,Religious Studies,"Buddhism, Chinese """"Popular"""" religion, Confucianism, Daoism, Pentecostalism,",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States

Particular attention is given to changes in social stratification and how these alterations are visible in the colonial texts about the East Asian colony. Conversely, the way in which Kiautschou was a manifest component in the developing sense of German identity during the Second Empire is emphasized, especially in terms of how texts about this colony both reflect and effect transformation in the period sense of Germanness. In addition, reading these texts with these elements in mind reveals Second Empire Germanness to be a hybrid product of its times, one vitally connected to how it represents and interacts with the Chinese in the Far East.

304870393,"Oyen, Meredith Leigh","Allies, enemies and aliens: Migration and U.S. -Chinese relations, 1940–1965",Contemporary,"Migration has long played a role in the U.S. relationship with China, but international tensions and changes in the 1940s and 1950s demonstrate the importance of this element in how the two nations interacted. Throughout this volatile era, immigration and diaspora policies played two key roles. First, the United States, the Republic of China, and later, the People's Republic of China all used their policies toward overseas Chinese to further their foreign policy goals. The United States used its immigration policies to further the foreign policy goals of promoting U.S. prestige, containing the spread of communism, and promoting the legitimacy of the government of the Republic of China. The Republic of China relied on its overseas citizens and on its management of migration issues to promote its own survival as it faced increasing competition from Chinese communists and declining legitimacy. Although the People's Republic of China made the shift from revolutionary party to governing entity during this period, it too looked to manage the movement of its people abroad and the attitudes of overseas Chinese communities to suit its interests. Second, immigration policies are not merely domestic polices, but can have long-reaching affects on how countries relate to one another. Although the United States repealed its Chinese Exclusion Laws in 1943, it experienced many unintended consequences of that policy in its interaction with the governments of the ROC and the PRC throughout these decades. Similarly, the contest between the ROC and the PRC for the loyalties of Chinese abroad had the sometimes unanticipated effect of damaging relations between the Chinese governments and the host governments of the Chinese abroad. In spite of their formal status as allies, attempts at cooperation between the U.S. and the Republic of China on immigration and diaspora issues had mixed results, as the two governments sometimes had very different views on the role of the Chinese overseas. Nonetheless, during the many conflicts affecting Sino-American relations at mid-century—World War II, the Chinese Civil War, the Korean War and the onset of the Cold War—migration issues had an important role to play.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,NA,NA,"History, American history, China, Chinese exclusion, Foreign policy, Immigration, Migration, Overseas Chinese, Sino-American relations, U.S.-Chienese relations, United States",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States

(Volumes I and II)",Contemporary,"This dissertation is devoted to studying the military weakness of the T'ung-meng-hui, the major revolutionary body in the Chinese 1911 revolution, and the Nanking Republican government of 1912. The period studied most intensively is 1895 to 1916, but it also includes 1916 to 1925. The study first examines the formation of the New Army of the late Ch'ing period which played a major role in the Wuchang Uprising and later became the crucial force in the political power struggle among the republican leaders and the militarists in the early republican era. The focus then shifts to the relationship between the T'ung-meng-hui and the New Army, and the power struggle between Yuan Shih-k'ai's military force and Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary party. In 1912, Sun Yat-sen met more changes than he expected. The establishment of a republican government was more complex than the revolutionary leaders forsaw. In studying the failure of the Nanking Republic and Kuomintang's defeat in the Second Revolution, in that period, its military weakness appears to be the main factor. The above perspective lays the basis for the research of the anti-monarchical movement in 1916 and the reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1923. After the downfall of Yuan Shih-k'ai in 1916 which was caused by the rise of the anti-monarchical forces in Yunnan and Kweichow, Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary party was still a powerless political organization appeasing the warlords to secure military support. The series of military defeats and many years of frustration finally forced Sun Yat-sen to accept help from the Russians in 1923. After the party reorganization and the establishment of a party army, the Kuomintang then became a truly powerful political force ready for accomplishing its revolutionary goal--the reestablishment of the republican government and a unified Chinese state.",1988,1988,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,NA,NA,"History, China",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States

Among the major findings, there were a variety of intellectual developments in North China. The textual scholarship was not yet a national obsession. Until around the end of the 17th century, northern scholars either ignored or denounced southern scholars' thesis that kaozheng was the only path to the truth of Confucian teaching. Second, in 17th-century North China, we see a renewed and increased emphasis on moral cultivation. Northern scholars never negated the moral component in their learning and in applying their academic endeavors to the socio-institutional reality of the time. Third, the state had by and large left many local scholarly activities in the hands of the participants, lacking applicable or effective means to impose the imperial Neo-Confucian orthodoxy on the district level. The three scholars openly disputed and criticized the philosophical and socio-institutional implications of the state orthodoxy. Fourth, northern scholars engaged themselves in active dialogue through a variety of communications networks, inter-personal, intra-regional, and inter-regional, on a level more animated and on a scale more widespread than present-day historians have acknowledged. Finally, a national integration of Qing Confucianism occurred during the 1750s, a new paradigm which was based on the intellectual persuasion and methodology of South China's kaozheng scholarship. To conclude, much of the current historiography of Qing thought must be modified to include the important features of Confucian learning in the northern region.

1720263947,"Wen, Shuang",Mediated imaginations: Chinese-Arab connections in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,Contemporary,"This project investigates the mediating role of western and Japanese powers in the intellectual, commercial, and interpersonal connections between Chinese and Arabic speaking societies during the high tide of global imperialism. Despite their geographic distance, Chinese and Arabs occupied a similar position in the world order as colonized and semi-colonized peoples in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In response to their comparable political and social situations, ideas, commodities, and people were transferred through transnational networks. Different modes of mediations—textual, material, and spatiotemporal—were involved in the processes. This phenomenon shows that the connections in an increasingly globalized modern world were not all about robust reticulation and accelerated interactions and exchanges. Rather, some of those linkages between non-western societies enmeshed in the scaffolding of global imperialism were attenuated and mediated by imperialism itself. Furthermore, the meditation processes were moving and transformative with the mediator and the mediated being in constant state of afflux. These layers of mediations constitute the mechanisms of the entanglements of the world. This new perspective on world history can provide a more nuanced understanding about the larger historical context at the turn of the twentieth century. In addition, by examining Chinese-Arab linkages, the modern histories of the Middle East and East Asia can no longer be understood as separate scholarly domains in isolation from one another. In elaborating the mediating role of imperialism that inadvertently connected the two non-western societies during the high tide of global imperial expansion, this dissertation delves into the topics of the circulation of “western” ideas on modernity and how “eastern” societies responded to them, the development of agriculture know-how, modern industry and consumer society, the travelling pan-Islamic ideas from the Near East to the Far East, the encounters of Arab and Chinese laborers in WWI working for the American Expeditionary Forces in France, the Christian missionary’s efforts to proselyte around the world, and the spread of western medicine to non-western societies.

The fate of Manchuria's forests largely depended on policies determined by the vital state interests of the Manchu, Russian, Japanese, and various Chinese regimes through whose hands the region passed. As state interests changed, so did the policies which affected forests, resulting not only in deforestation and forest transformation, but also in conservation, afforestation, and progress toward sustainable forestry. Variations in policies depended not only on the interests regimes pursued, but also on their strength and stability. The Qing turned from the closure to the development of northern and eastern Manchuria's forests in the face of excess population pressure on resources, fiscal crises, and looming Russian invasion. later, the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo turned from sustainable forestry in its confident first years, to the drawdown of Manchuria's forest resources when Manchukuo was destabilized by Japan's start of the Pacific War in 1941. Nevertheless, the Japanese nurtured forests to a far greater extent than the ROC had, because the ROC lacked the strength to implement its own forestry program. Russian colonizers, by contrast, carried out very limited afforestation efforts, taking no steps to ensure future forest productivity. The early PRC's modest goals of reducing deforestation and ameliorating its effects were undercut by reliance on local officials and undercompensated peasants whose interests lay with agriculture rather than forestry. The state-building leaders of the ROC, Japanese, and PRC regimes sought not only the continuing provision of forest products and the ecological services such as flood control which forests provide, but also the heightened popular support moving towards such goals can elicit.

304595766,"Dale, Melissa S.",With the cut of a knife: A social history of eunuchs during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) and Republican periods (1912–1949),Modern,"As a social history of eunuchs during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) and Republican periods (1912–1949), this study examines a complicated social group whose emasculation and employment located them at the center of the empire yet also subjected them to servile status and marginalization by society. In contrast to previous histories which have focused on the political intrigues and corruption of individual eunuchs, my study examines the life courses of the ordinary eunuch. Specifically, I seek to chronicle Qing eunuch life from the moment of emasculation to a new life within the Forbidden City. I further explore routes eunuchs utilized to leave the palace. Finally, I discuss the fate of eunuchs after the fall of the Qing and into the Republican era. The study finds that eunuchs were gender misfits and social outcasts who served as imperial slaves. “Volunteers” supplied the court with eunuchs. However, emasculation was not always an individual choice. Poverty and a preference for young emasculates often led to the coerced emasculation of minors and the trafficking in male children. Eunuch lifelong tenure reveals the complexity of non-free status during the Qing. Subject to frequent beatings, restricted mobility, and deprived of the freedom to terminate their employment and the right to dispose of their own bodies, eunuchs desperate to leave the system faced two options, flight or suicide. While oppressed, eunuchs were not mere victims but also actively recreated the social bonds that emasculation and employment within the court denied them. Master/apprentice bonds, native place associations, pseudo-familial relationships and even marriage afforded eunuchs some semblance of family life, instilled a sense of esprit de corps , and provided a degree of agency. Upon retirement, financial problems, discrimination, and disassociation from family members complicated eunuch reintegration into society. After the abolition of the eunuch system in 1923, expelled eunuchs, like retirees, formed retirement communities in temples outside of Beijing. Others continued to serve Pu Yi (the last emperor) in Manchuria (Manzhouguo) until 1945. In sum, this study recasts and reclaims the past of this previously silent and often miscast group so vital to the court.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,NA,NA,"History, Cultural anthropology, China, Eunuchs, Qing dynasty, Republican periods, Social history",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
304642819,"Lin, Catherine Kai-Ping",Nationalism in international politics: The Republic of China's sports foreign policy -making and diplomacy from 1972 to 1981,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines Taiwan's diplomatic history since the 1970s with an emphasis on the extent to which nationalism has had an impact on its foreign relations. Since 1971, when the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan lost its United Nations (UN) seat, the country has gradually shifted its foreign policy. While once its focus was on the One-China Policy, that is, conquering the mainland and reunifying China, the current Taiwan government cautiously promotes Taiwan's status as an independent country in the face of continuing non-recognition. Many have argued that this transformation in Taiwan's foreign policy is solely the result of changing international circumstances since the 1970s, when the People's Republic of China (PRC) became important to the US in balancing the weight of Soviet power. Viewed from this Cold War-centric perspective, the ROC government on Taiwan, which used to be the US's staunch ally against Communism, became less significant to the US. Taiwan eventually came to terms with the fact that its dream of retaking the mainland with US help would never come to pass. As more countries switched their recognition from the ROC to the PRC as the legitimate government of China, including the US in 1979, the ROC government had to seek legitimacy within Taiwan. As a result, according to this changed international circumstances school of thought, the ROC government in turn adjusted its foreign policy pragmatically to survive on Taiwan. Through a chronological case study of Taiwan's sports foreign policy-making and diplomacy from 1972 to 1981, this dissertation aims to enrich the current established school of thought by arguing that forces from within the ROC government--especially the Chinese nationalism of its top leadership—also had a significant impact on the conduct of Taiwan's foreign relations during these two decades.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,NA,NA,"History, International law, China, Diplomacy, Foreign policy-making, International politics, Nationalism, Republic of China, Sports, Sports diplomacy, Sports foreign policy-making, Taiwan",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
304600897,"Wall, Michael Clarence",Chinese reaction to the portrayal of China and Chinese in American motion pictures prior to 1949,Contemporary,"As the motion picture industry expanded in the early part of the twentieth century, films soon were recognized as a medium of unparalleled capacity for potentially influencing their audiences. The belief that public opinion could be swayed by on-screen images prompted the rigorous examination of movie content. For China, embroiled in internal upheaval and contending with external prejudice, motion picture characterizations and imagery acquired tremendous importance. Because American productions dominated the world market during this period, Sino-American relations necessarily were influenced by Chinese interest in this area. This dissertation examines the consequences of film depictions some Chinese found to be derogatory and inaccurate to assess not only the nature of the relationship between China and the United States prior to 1949, but also to reveal the intensity of Chinese convictions regarding the status due their nation during this period of history. Chinese evaluations of Hollywood movies felt to insult China and the official steps taken by the Chinese government to punish or persuade the producing studios and others to refrain from making similar motion pictures are discussed to examine the Chinese agenda. The numerous and concentrated attempts to reverse Hollywood's cinematic presentation of the Chinese as sinister and coarse people and China as a backward and lawless nation fundamentally were motivated by a desire to project internationally a positive image of China in a bid to secure respect and equality on the world stage. Critical analysis of these issues serves as a effective next step in the scholarly examination of the American understanding of China and Chinese. Additionally, this dissertation contributes to an improved comprehension of Chinese attitudes and expectations, fueled by intensifying feelings of nationalism during a time of tremendous change in China. This dissertation strives to illustrate the basis for Chinese reactions to the certain images found in American motion pictures. These concerns reflected a natural disdain for what were unquestionably disparaging and fallacious characterizations. Moreover, there existed an intense desire to provide the world with a portrait of the country and its people that would advance, rather than detract from, their status in the international realm.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, Motion Pictures, China, Motion pictures, Portrayal, Stereotypes",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
1701628839,"Hammond, Kelly Anne","The conundrum of collaboration: Japanese involvement with Muslims in North China, 1931-1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation argues that Chinese Muslims living under occupation who collaborated with the Japanese were actively involved in creating an on-going dialogue between the Japanese Empire and the Chinese Nationalists about strategies for managing minority populations on the mainland. The dissertation describes some of the ways which the Japanese transformed the social and political milieu in which Islam operated in North China and argues that the Japanese approach ultimately shaped the minority policies of both Nationalist and later Communist governments in China. More broadly, the dissertation demonstrates that twentieth-century projects of nation and state building in China have shaped (and reshaped) people’s understanding of the place of Islam in Chinese society and the place of Muslims from China in the Islamic world. The dissertation contributes to the scholarship on Modern East Asia in three ways. While the idea of wartime collaboration of Chinese with the Japanese continues to be an important area of research, I draw attention to a historically important minority group in China who made the choice to work with their Japanese occupiers. By showcasing the experience of Muslims living under occupation, my work refutes claims that there was anything resembling a cohesive Muslim resistance during the war. Secondly, the dissertation contributes to the on-going demystification of war in twentieth-century China by bringing to light some of the everyday experiences of Muslims living under occupation. Thirdly, by focusing on Japanese policies, Nationalist responses and Chinese Muslims themselves, the dissertation examines hitherto unconsidered political and social outcomes of WWII on minority populations in China. Taken as a whole, the project adds to both the understanding of the experiences of war in East Asia and to re-thinking the place of Muslims from China in the broader nexus of global Islam in the twentieth- century.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,History,History,"History, Islamic Studies, Modern history, China, China war, Islam, Japan, Nationalism, Wwii",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States

The early twentieth-century Catholic Church faced a crisis of witness in China: Missionary practice maintained the dominance of European powers even as Chinese Catholics sought to join their compatriots to build an independent and modern “New China.” Seeing a clash of interests between lingering foreign imperialism and rising domestic nationalism, Vincent Lebbe worked to indigenize Chinese Catholicism. First, within the Church, Lebbe opposed the French Religious Protectorate and the exclusivity of the European leadership over Chinese clergy. He promoted the case of Chinese ethno-national citizens to become bishops. Second, on the wider national stage, Lebbe promoted Chinese patriotism and rallied Catholics to contribute to the progress and defense their country. Catholics participated in the anti-Confucianism campaign of the 1910s and the Confucian New Life Movement of the Nationalist government in the 1930s. In Lebbe’s war-time service against Japan, he closely aligned the Chinese Church with the domestic ruling party-state. In these efforts to indigenize Chinese Catholicism, a key theological question was the nature of Chinese Catholic citizenship: how might Chinese Catholics might fulfill their civic and spiritual duties as members of both the Chinese nation and of the Kingdom of God? In my analysis, Lebbe’s work is best understood as a project to indigenize the Catholic Church at a time when to make the Church “Chinese” was to make it national. On the one hand, his vision did separate mission from the exercise of foreign power and it crucially secured the support of the Holy See for the indigenous episcopacy. On the other hand, Lebbe’s work did not involve a nuanced theological account of the relationship between mission and the domestic state, leaving largely untreated the question of how a fully indigenous Church might also remain a pilgrim Church seeking the heavenly kingdom of God. Concluding that indigenization must include but transcend nationalization, I suggest that Lebbe’s project partially indigenized Chinese Catholicism and inaugurated an ongoing effort to envision Chinese Catholic citizenship.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,Theological & Religious Studies,Religious Studies,"Philosophy, religion and theology, Catholicism, China, Indigenization, Lei Mingyuan, Republican era, Vincent Lebbe,",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States

This dissertation aims to understand the background to this transition, focussing on the period 1971-1986. Between 1971 and 1986, the political system in Taiwan moved from hard authoritarianism to a more pluralistic form of authoritarianism. the changes of 1971-1986 also laid the foundation for the post-1986 transformation. The study focusses on decisions to alter (or refuse to alter) the political system made by the ruling Kuomintang. These choices are explained in terms of several factors: The KMT party-state had an institutional interest in change to enhance domestic legitimacy and also to improve Taiwan's external relations. The KMT would not have chosen reform, however, except that--under pressure from intellectuals, the democratic opposition, and critics in the US--softliners in the KMT gradually convinced the pragmatic leader (Chiang Ching-kuo) that the hardliner policy of resisting change indefinitely would undermine the KMT's ability to win domestic and international supporters.

The main force behind the conflicts was Qing territorial expansions into Tibetan and Turkic regions and resultant legal implementation and cultural representations of new-subject populations. The location of the Salars at the hub of Chinese-Tibetan-Turkic frontiers put the Salar Muslims into the forefront of Muslim-state conflicts when the Qing annexed Tibetan regions and populations along southwest Gansu. Having first identified the Salars as Tibetan, the Qing implemented the Tibetan Statutes ( fanli ), which were designed for Tibetans in Gansu regions. However, the coming of new Islamic (Sufi) teachings and the subsequent religious lawsuits between Salars quickly revealed the inefficiency of the Tibetan Statutes and open conflict broke out between new-teaching Salars and the state in 1781. The Salar-state conflict revealed problems not only in the Qing's legal practice but also in its cultural representation of the Salars. The Qing re-classified the Salars from Tibetan to Muslim (or from Fan to Hui ) during and after the Salar-state conflict. However, this state re-identification of the Salars as Muslim created a new set of misconceptions regarding Islamic leadership institutions in the Salar as well as interior regions, since the Salars were now incorporated into the Gansu interior regions. The Qing identified the Muslim leadership institution of zhangjiao (teaching-holder, imam) as an invention of the new teaching, which conflicted with the state. Thus the Qing prohibited and physically executed zhangjiao as an institution. The state conflict with new-teaching Salars and extermination of the category of new-teaching zhangjiao alarmed Muslim religious leaders, zhangjiao or ahun (imam, arkund ) leading them seeking vengeance, take flight and rebel in 1784, three years after the Salar-state conflict. The Qing's pacification of the new-teaching Muslims, however, led to the discovery that the new teaching the state envisioned as new and heterodox in interior regions was actually old and orthodox in Xinjiang, newly acquired by the Qing. This state interpretation of and policies towards Islam and Muslims on the basis of region re-legalized the new teaching in interior regions. By linking the Qing's new territories, new subject populations, and new legal practices to new Muslim teachings, this study provides insights into the territorial, administrative, and legal nature of the so-called cultural conflicts between Muslims and the Qing. It also sheds light on the larger consequences of the Qing expansion into Tibetan and Turkic regions to China in general and Muslim cultural practices in particular. This study is specifically aimed at describing the contradictions and conflicts between imperial expansion and administrative-legal practices, on the one hand, and frontier religions and ethnicities, on the other.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,NA,NA,"Religion, History, Law, Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, China, Gansu, Muslims, Qing dynasty, Regulations, Religion",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
2090000012,"Shi, Yue ","The Seven Rivers: Empire and Economy in the Russo-Qing Central Asian Frontier, 1860s-1910s",Contemporary,"I use the comparison of both Russian and Qing imperial rule in their shared Central Asian frontier to investigate the nature of both empires and the concept of empire in general. The Yili- Balkhash region, the geographical focus of this work, was divided between Russia and Qing in the mid-nineteenth century into two contiguous administrative units: the Tsarist Semirech’e Province (1867–1917) and the Qing Yili-Tarbaghatai Circuit (1884–1912). The administrative systems of these two units and their reforms, the imperial education policy and the trans-regional trade in this region between the two empires are the thematic focuses. The Russian Empire exerted direct control over its Yili-Balkhash frontier since its conquest of this region in the 1860s. The administrative system of Semirech’e Province from its beginning extended to the county level and attempted to infiltrate the local communities via native administration based on a supervised electoral system. Waves of reforms further integrated Semirech’e frontier into the imperial administrative system. In contrast, the Qing elite similarly attempted to consolidate its control in Xinjiang by applying the more centralized administrative system of China Proper. Such efforts were obstructed by both the perennial financial constraints and the bureaucratic rivalries between Yili and Urumqi, the power centers of the Bannermen and the Hunanese clique in Xinjiang respectively. By balancing these two elite groups, the Qing court was still able to maintain control over the frontier affairs in the last three decades of the empire. From the financial perspective, both Tsarist Semirech’e and Qing Yili-Tarbaghatai heavily relied upon the subsidies from the central government. The Semirech’e administration was able to extract more local resources to support the frontier government than its counterpart in Yili-Tarbaghatai. But in general, civilian projects such as infrastructure and schooling were poorly funded in contrast to the basic expenditures of the military and the bureaucracy. Despite the limited investment in the education sector, the Semirech’e administration showed astonishingly strong commitment to spreading Russian language among the native communities, as is demonstrated in their efforts to establish schools among Dungans and Taranchis, the Qing immigrants resettled in Semirech’e around the 1880s. Oppositely, in Qing Xinjiang, the shortage of financial resources rendered similar large-scale schooling projects ineffective. Only until mid- 1900s did the Qing frontier elite in both Urumqi and Yili launch a new wave of education campaign. Additionally, the delineation of Yili-Balkhash region and the subsequent diplomatic settlements between Russia and Qing contributed to the re-emergence of trans-regional trade between European Russia and Qing northwestern frontier. The comparatively peaceful environment, the communication and transportation infrastructure and the trans-imperial commercial privileges undergirded by empires facilitated its prosperity, a phenomenon reminiscent of the recent scholarly debates over the Silk Road. In a nutshell, albeit both Russia and Qing maintained the imperial elements such as the limited autonomy for heterogeneous ethnicities on the grassroots level and porous frontier convenient for travel and transportation, the reforms of administration system, the financial management and the education policies on both sides of the border indicated a transition to a more centralized and direct way of frontier administration, and thus I refer to Tsarist Russia and Qing in this process “nationalizing empires.”",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,History,History,"Social sciences, Empire, Frontier, Kazakhstan, Qing, Semirech'e, Tsarist Russia,",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States

It considers political, social, cultural, and environmental aspects of typhoons from the fifth to the twentieth century and argues that successive states and generations of Chinese that occupied the province’s littoral regarded it as a """"typhoon space."""" The real and perceived vulnerability of the Guangdong littoral inspired efforts at community- and state-building that had many consequences. In exploring the deep consciousness of storms and the social structures they inspired in a major part of China, I will contribute to both climate history and Chinese history by reimagining the spatial frameworks within which we study human interactions with the environment. My project takes seriously the constructed nature of the Guangdong littoral as a """"typhoon space"""" and its location in a tropical cyclone basin, arguing that its perceived vulnerability to storms across centuries was as influential in shaping its history as was the destructive force of the storms that so often came ashore. By delineating specific spaces where climatic phenomena have a deep influence on human society and culture, my project facilitates the reimagining of China, and even the world, as consisting of discrete, but at times overlapping, climate spaces. These, crucially, would not be the same as climate regions as understood by climatologists and enshrined in countless maps. Rather, they would be based both on climatic phenomena and social, cultural, and political structures that evolved to cope with climate features. Since climate spaces do not neatly coincide with the nation, province, or other familiar spatial categories, my project invites a rethinking of space in Chinese history and more globally in environmental history. Thinking in terms of climate spaces also eases comparisons by providing a common language for speaking about similar phenomena across the globe. For example, we can think of typhoon spaces in the Western Pacific and hurricane spaces in the Caribbean as comparable """"storm spaces"""" within a transnational history of wind, water, risk, and response. It is my hope that reimagining coastal China as a typhoon space and thinking more broadly in terms of climate spaces may serve as catalysts for advancing both global environmental history and the underdeveloped field of Chinese climate history.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Georgetown University,History,History,"Social sciences, Health and environmental sciences, Chinese history, Climate history, Climate space, Typhoon space,",17,Washington,District of Columbia,38.9047,-77.0163,United States
862348125,"Zhou, Fang","The Wheels that Transformed the City: The Historical Development of Public Transportation Systems in Shanghai, 1843–1937",Contemporary,"The city of Shanghai was transformed from a treaty port of around half a million people when the British first arrived after the end of the Opium War to become the most populous, prosperous, and cosmopolitan metropolis in China by the early 20 th century. The development of public transportation systems contributed significantly to the urban expansion and growth of the city, as well as in reshaping the city's identity. This dissertation examined the impact of public transportation on the urban landscape of Shanghai by focusing on three major issues: “tradition versus modernity”, state and society relations, and the relationship between technology and society. As a divided city governed by three separate political jurisdictions, Shanghai offered a unique perspective in understanding the roles public transportation and urban planning played in changing a city's layout. This dissertation addressed the specific differences in the development of urban infrastructure and its impact on population growth, mobility and accessibility, and economic prosperity of the British controlled International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Chinese city. The first half of the dissertation analyzed the roles in which “traditional” man-powered vehicles such as the wheelbarrow, sedan chair, horse-drawn carriage, and rickshaw played, before delving into the arrival of “modern” machine-powered vehicles such as automobiles, trams, trolleys, and buses in the early 20 th century. Each form of transportation vehicle is discussed for its specific role, and the type of clientele it catered. This dissertation argued that man-powered vehicles and machine-powered vehicles did not necessarily compete with each other for passengers, as each type of vehicle served its specific purposes and clients. Public transportation. just like food, clothing, or housing is a form of material culture where one's socioeconomic or class status is revealed by the type of transport one chooses. Because the different types of vehicles did not directly compete with each other, they all saw significant increases in ridership. The “tradition versus modernity” theme is aimed at addressing the bigger picture of “continuity and change”, where Shanghai was transformed by foreign influences yet at the same time it still retained traditional Chinese characteristics to form a complex identity. The second half of the dissertation dealt with state and society relations, and the relationship of technology and society. The issue of public versus private responsibility is addressed with historical analysis of government orchestrated urban planning and the private sector providing the services to fulfill the people's needs and demands. In focusing on these two themes, this dissertation argued that technology has inherent political agenda attached to it, as government policies specifically created areas of the city which had better public transportation infrastructure, which led to these parts of the city being more commercially prosperous and vibrant than others. Routes, lines, and stops were designated with specific political purposes in mind, and public transportation accessibility contributed to the uneven economic developments across the city. The Greater Shanghai Project of 1927-1937 was a specific attempt by the Chinese government to create a new city center that could shift the population away from the foreign concessions into the Chinese territories. This dissertation argued that this campaign would not have been feasible even without the Japanese attack due to insufficient public funds.

875238796,"Liu, Yinghua",Chinese converts in the Chinese Rites Controversy: Ancestral rites and their identity,Modern,"The Chinese Rites Controversy was not merely European affair centered on missionaries but also a big challenge to Chinese Christian converts. Chinese converts wrote quite a few books, pamphlets and letters related to it. Many of those texts concerned ancestral rites and have not been fully explored. Some scholars, though avoiding being extremely missionary-oriented, still perceive the Christian converts as only a receiving end. Yet, a close examination on the relevant Chinese texts of ancestral rites shows that the Rites Controversy provides the platform for Chinese converts to construct their faith though careful study in Chinese Classics. They made efforts to open up the boundaries between Confucianism and Christianity. They believed in Christianity wholeheartedly but also firmly maintained their Confucian identity. Therefore, assessing the Rites Controversy from their perspective confirms that: the cultural dialogue between the Chinese and missionaries at the time was reciprocal. the Chinese were both presenters and receivers. and Chinese converts were both Confucians and Christians. Their two identities are united without loss of any essential attribute and that they maintained their separate natures though they may share some common elements. However, an issue is still alive: How could Chinese converts' dual identity (Confucian and Christian) be well achieved?

848587648,"Ha, Hee-Jung","The formation of modern womanhood in East Asia, 1880–1920: American evangelical gender ideology and modern nation-building",Contemporary,"In the late nineteenth century, East Asia experienced a pivotal momentum for the development of feminist consciousness. Challenging traditional family systems and social restraints against women, Asian male reformers and Protestant missionaries worked together to improve women's status in pursuit of social progress toward civilization. Both groups advocated women's education and gender equality before Asian women's involvement in the creation of new female subjectivity. Asian nationalist desires for modernizing the country coincided with the evangelical enthusiasm of Protestant missionaries for civilizing Asian societies and their women. However, the Asian formation of gender frameworks does not mean that Asian women had shared experience to define themselves, regardless of geographical variations and political complexities. 'twentieth-century imperialism changed the paradoxical situation of East Asia in which all three societies saw the alliance of Asian male reformers and Protestant missionaries for modernizing women. The successful inauguration of a Japanese empire drove Asian women into diverse forms of patriotism in East Asia. while Japanese women were supported for colonizing Asia, Chinese and Korean women were mobilized to resist Japanese colonization. The new ideal of 'educating mother' was encouraged to support the establishment of a modern nation-state, producing varying meanings and functions in the region. Patriotic motherhood also compelled Protestant missionaries to negotiate with traditional gender ideologies in response to geo-political complexities of East Asia. This research proposes that the development of Asian feminist consciousness has to be understood in a complex dynamic process of national and self re-definition. At the dawn of modern era, Asian women were not simply traditionalists nor were they simply secular modernists. The interdependent relations among Protestant missionaries, Asian male reformers, and female advocates gives a more complex picture of Asian women and their negotiation of modernity in the construction of new gender identity. In negotiations with their male colleagues and Protestant missionaries, Asian women constructed their own structures and framework of understanding themselves in relation to society.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Graduate Theological Union,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Womens studies, American Protestantism and Asian women, Asian nationalism and gender, Asian women and modernity, China, Chinese women and Christian missions, Evangelical, Japan, Japanese women and Christian missions, Korea, Korean women and Christian missions, Modernity, Nationalism, Womanhood",3,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304625138,"Park, Hyung Shin","Presbyterian missionaries in Southern Manchuria, 1867–1931: Religion, society, and politics",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the ways in which the Irish, Scottish, Korean, and American Presbyterian missionaries in Southern Manchuria represented the gospel, discovered the needs of the converts and other people in the area, and transformed their mission methods in the late Qing and the early Republican period of China. The first chapter surveys the home-base of the missionaries from the four different nationalities and suggests that the common theological orientation of the missionaries was orthodox Presbyterianism and Evangelicalism. Some other formative factors from the home-bases were the emphases on education, commerce or development, social responsibility, and the sense of duty in the spread of “civilization.” Those features, in general, shaped the “superiority” of both Christianity and Western civilization in the mind and practice of the Presbyterian missionaries. The second chapter shows that the missionaries pursued unity within the Presbyterian tradition, cooperation and comity along with the churches in other traditions and the missionary societies, and the development of an indigenous Presbytery or Church both in Manchuria and the rest of China. The missionaries, however, also maintained their narrow-mindedness in unity, a reluctance in divesting themselves of the responsibilities for the Church of Manchuria, and a hostile attitude toward the Roman Catholic Church. In encountering Chinese religions, they generally held the position that the Chinese religions were “pagan” or “superstitious” and that Christianity was superior to them. However, a few missionaries tried to understand those religions from an historical point of view and affirm some aspects of their spirituality. They thereby hoped to see the emergence of a Chinese Christianity with Chinese religious and cultural characteristics. The third chapter investigates the ways in which the missionaries worked among immigrants, refugees and the sick. The period that the missionaries worked in Southern Manchuria was also a time in which massive migrations from North China, Korea, and Japan to Manchuria were made. It was also a time when China, Russia, and Japan were competing with one another for the dominance in East Asia. This resulted in a couple of international wars mainly in Southern Manchuria. The missionaries were faced with a considerable number of immigrants and refugees as a result of the wars. The desperate needs of the people in Southern Manchuria helped the missionaries change their mission methods and dedicate themselves to relief, development, and some other types of activities to improve the conditions of the people's life. Whereas the other three nationalities dealt mainly with the marginalized, the American missionaries who worked among the Japanese in the Kwantung Leased Territory in Manchuria had a different context in encountering the (semi)-colonizers. The last chapter analyzes the missionaries' political and ‘politically neutral’ stances made in response to national events. Experiencing the Boxer Uprising of 1900 and the May Thirtieth Incident of 1925, the British missionaries came to be sympathetic to Chinese nationalism and expressed their willingness to abandon the political rights of Christian missions coming out of the unequal treaties. Korean missionaries joined the anti-colonial movement in Manchuria as contributing to nationalistic education. In addition, facing the crisis of the Korean immigrants' survival in the midst of the competing Chinese and Japanese nationalisms in Manchuria, some Korean missionaries participated in the naturalization movement for Chinese citizenship. Some American missionaries saw the bilingual and bicultural ability in many Koreans residing in Manchuria. They hoped to mobilize them for the evangelization of the Chinese. The American missionaries among the Japanese in Manchuria had the attitude of ‘political neutrality.’ However, they were, especially in the early period of their work, considerably dependent on the financial support of the Japanese Kwantung Government. In the conclusion, the author suggests that the direction for the future study of Christianity in Manchuria should be indigenization and contextualization of the Church. He also suggests the direction for trans-nationality in encouraging the study of Christianity among the minority ethnic groups in Manchuria and the study of the transnational expressions between and among the different groups.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Graduate Theological Union,NA,NA,"Religious history, Religious history, History, China, Evangelicalism, Indigenization, Manchuria, Missions, Presbyterian, Presbyterianism, Trans-nationality",3,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States

Although the new administration proposed to liberate the United States from past policies and offer fresh, innovative solutions to problems confronted worldwide, the major issues that characterized and defined the American relationship with both the Chinese Communists on the mainland and the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan posed a challenge for the new President and his foreign policy advisers. This study examines several contending circumstances that offered the opportunity for the Kennedy administration to establish a new direction in U.S. China policy: the Chinese representation issue at the United Nations and related debates with the GRC on alternative strategies. the U.S. position regarding the Nationalist regime's efforts to return to the mainland and the status of the offshore islands. the administration's deliberations surrounding the possibility of U.S. food aid for Communist China. and the growing trend advocating a more flexible American approach toward Peking and the circumstances that militated against the development of such ideas. Rather than pursue alternative approaches, however, the Kennedy administration chose to perpetuate the status quo in the U.S. posture toward both Chinese governments and aimed to maintain the tenuous balance of power existing in East Asia. Despite the lack of a major departure from existing policies, initiatives proposing a reappraisal of U.S. China policy during the Kennedy administration precipitated discussions and debates that significantly contributed to the evolution towards the eventual transformation of Sino-American relations.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"American history, History, History, China, Foreign policy, Kennedy administration, United States",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

Niya),Ancient,"The early history of Inner Asian cultures has until recently tended to neglect documents of everyday life. The present dissertation is a textual and geographical study of aspects of the landscape and culture of the ancient country of Kroraina, which was situated in the southeastern Tarim basin (Chinese central Asia) in about the 3 rd and 4 th centuries C.E. More than a thousand documents in a dialect of the Gāndhārī language have been discovered at the ruins of Krorainic sites, consisting mainly of legal and administrative documents, written in the Kharosthī script on wooden tablets. In the study of these documents as ethnographic sources, a thesis of a fundamental relationship of archaic forms of kinship to the landscape is suggested, through a close comparison of the texts with the archaeological contexts of their discovery. A brief historiography of these documents is given, followed by a situation of their historical study within the natural environment and human geography of the Tarim basin. Contextualizing the documents more closely within the site which where the bulk of them were discovered (the Niya site or ancient Cad´ota), an image of the spatial structure of the oasis landscape is developed. Through the analysis of the residence and kinship relations of individuals known in the documents from this oasis, in comparison with the archaeological contexts of different groups of documents, the affiliation of individuals to particular settlements and territories is established. This reconstruction allows for the analysis in space of marriage exchanges between the territories of different kinship groups. Cross-cousin marriage or generational marriage exchange between territorially localized groups is documented, and in comparison with historical parallels in the region, several aspects of Krorainic culture are seen to display archaic features and historical and geographical relationships with other ancient culture areas in the region.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Ancient languages, Archaeology, History, Archaic, China, Culture, Fourth century, Inner Asian, Landscape, Niya, Oasis, Third century",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
816191604,"Moser, Jeffrey Christopher",Recasting antiquity: Ancient bronzes and ritual hermeneutics in the Song dynasty,Medieval,"This dissertation examines the ways in which the rediscovery of ancient bronzes in the eleventh century changed the ritual hermeneutics of the Northern Song dynasty. In particular, it considers the impact of bronzes on the interpretive strategies used to reconstruct the ceremonial paraphernalia—the vessels, vestments, and vehicles—named in the Book of Ceremony and Rites ( Yili ), the Rites of Zhou ( Zhouli ), and the Record of Rites ( Liji ). Because these classic texts had for centuries been esteemed as guidelines for appropriate imperial and aristocratic conduct, generations of exegetes had endeavored to determine the proper shape and substance of the implements named within. When eleventh century scholars began to decipher the inscriptions on ancient bronzes, they realized that many of them were actual remnants of the very ceremonies that these ritual classics purportedly recorded. Yet the bronzes looked quite different from ceremonial implements reconstructed by earlier exegetes. This discrepancy set off a crisis of confidence in the capacity of existing hermeneutics to reliably recover the normative models of antiquity. The present study explores some of the ways in which Northern Song emperors and literati dealt with that crisis. By approaching the Song rediscovery of ancient bronzes as a catalyst for new intellectual problematics, this dissertation also draws into question modern attempts to collectively situate Song discourses on bronzes under rubrics such as antiquarianism or archaeology. These rubrics, I argue, are anachronistic, in that they suggest a coherent set of concerns and commonality of purpose that is not evidenced in the actual writings of the Song figures in question. By focusing on the arguments internal to the historical texts themselves, rather than the agendas of the later fields that adopted these texts as intellectual forebears, I attempt to narrate a more nuanced story of the various ways in which ancient bronzes informed Song intellectual life.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Art history, Bronzes, China, Collecting, Huizong, Ritual, Son Dynasty",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
878904392,"Miller, Allison Ruth","Patronage, Politics, and the Emergence of Rock-Cut Tombs in Early Han China",Ancient,"For the past thirty years, scholars have largely assumed that the ancient Chinese primarily built tombs for reasons related to the afterlife. Nearly all early Chinese tombs, whether belonging to emperors or petty local officials, are interpreted in this light—as spaces to be inhabited by the deceased after death. This focus on the afterlife, however, is a relatively recent direction in scholarship. Prior to the last few decades, Chinese scholars generally agreed that the ancient Chinese did not have a clear notion of the afterlife until the rise of Buddhism, basing their interpretation on the notorious silence of ancient texts on this issue. This dissertation explores reasons other than the afterlife that so much wealth and labor were expended on monumental tombs in early China. It does so by analyzing the social and political tensions underlying a major shift in tomb architecture that occurred in the Western Han dynasty—the emergence of rock-cut tombs. Rock-cut tombs were meticulously-carved, grotto palaces that bore little resemblance to the mounded, earthen pit tombs that had preceded them. These tombs changed the orientation of elite Chinese burials for the rest of Chinese history. By examining this shift in tomb architecture, my work suggests that by the mid-Western Han, tomb architecture had become a principal means by which rulers marketed new political agendas and elites expressed their social and political identities. Relying on evidence from texts and archaeology, my research traces the history of tomb construction back to the Eastern Zhou to understand why tombs may have assumed this function by the Western Han. It also demonstrates the way that the study of shifts in material culture can lead to significant revisions of Han political history. This study, for example, challenges the typical conflation of the reigns of Emperors Wen (r. 180–157 BC) and Jing (r. 157–141 BC), and argues that Emperor Wen, rather than the founding emperor, ought to be considered as the chief architect of Han political ideology.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Art history, China, Funerary architecture, Gift, Han dynasty, Imperial state formation, Patronage, Rock-cut tombs, Stone funerary architecture, Yi, Jia",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304852864,"Campbell, Roderick Bruce","Blood, flesh and bones: Kinship and violence in the social economy of the Late Shang",Ancient,"The Shang dynasty has occupied a central place in both Chinese history and archaeology of the last century. As the earliest period in China for which there is near unanimous agreement on the presence of state societies, the Shang period has also figured prominently in archaeological discussions of social complexity. However, in framing historical development in terms of movements from kinship to bureaucracy, sacred to secular and religion to philosophy, traditional accounts of Early China have embedded Shang history in Enlightenment teleologies while avoiding the issues of how belief' and authority are produced through historically situated social-economic practices and institutions. Moreover, recent comparative analyses of early polities have tended to shoe-horn the Shang polity(ies) into categories derived from other societies without adequate regard or understanding of the historical particulars of the physical, practical and discursive constitution of Shang society and world. Eschewing backward projected teleologies or content-free generalizations, I argue for a study of the past in terms of the many braided relationships between social practices and the constitution of being and world. After critically reviewing recent theory on early polities and its application to China I present an up-dated account of North China in the 2 nd millennium B.C. and through a synthetic analysis of archaeological, epigraphic and transmitted textual evidence sketch an outline of the socio-political landscape of the Late Shang. Reconstructing Late Shang practices of authority and their material bases, I focus on sacrifice, warfare and burial in their role in the constitution of social identity and hierarchy as intersecting practices of kinship and violence. Based on these analyses I argue that the Late Shang world was ceaselessly ordered through domesticating practices based on communal violence, ancestral construction and sacrifice, recursively (re)producing, through differential participation in these practices a hierarchy of being that stretched from sacrificial victims to deified ancestors and the high god Di. Moreover, with place and identity experienced in terms of hierarchical relationships of kinship and patronage, social obligation and political authority were produced through universal participation and investment in a radically inegalitarian social economy of kinship and violence.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, China, Kinship, Shang dynasty, Social economy, State formation, Violence",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
4530000076,"Lu, Yi ",The Dustbin of History: Making Archives in Modern China,Contemporary,"For nearly a century, scholars of China have used discarded government papers, often peddled at flea markets outside the law, to peel away the country’s secrecy. Even till today, these “garbage materials” have spawned archival collections and academic careers, but little understood is their provenance and circulation, let alone their enduring impact on Chinese history and historiography. This dissertation examines the social history of information in twentieth-century China by focusing on the afterlives of its official archives. From sold-off papers of the Qing Empire to remnants of the Mao era, this study examines bureaucratic governance as a material practice. Through an economy of paper reuse, the most marginalized members of society, such as waste recyclers, were connected to the highest echelon of power. Combining archival research and ethnographic fieldwork, this project highlights the enduring role of grassroots collections in shaping historical knowledge and memory in China. Beyond contributing to intellectual and social histories of modern China, this study is also an ethnography of the state. As much as paperwork was key to the creation of bureaucratic knowledge, it co-existed uneasily with demands of the mass line in Mao’s China. Tracing the Chinese Communist Party’s transformation from an underground organization to a ruling regime, this dissertation explores the tension between bureaucratic governance and mass mobilization. Archival leaks were more than breaches of official secrecy; they constituted informal channels of political communication inside a fragmented organization and allowed for popular participation in state violence. Finally, this project examines China as a key player in the global history of big data. From the Dewey Decimal System to Soviet archival methods to mass digitization, successive Chinese governments have experimented with various information technologies to manage growing volumes of records. In the reverse direction, this study uses computational tools to survey China’s archival landscape and to reverse its algorithms of censorship. Bridging book history, history of science, and digital humanities, it raises urgent questions about the definition of archive, the meaning of preservation and destruction, and the processes and possibilities of historical knowledge production.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,History,History,"Archive, Bureaucracy, Censorship, China, Information, Memory,",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304206012,"Riely, Celia Carrington",Tung Ch'i-ch'ang's life (1555-1636): The interplay of politics and art,Modern,"Acknowledged in his lifetime and ever since as foremost painter, calligrapher, connoisseur, and art theorist of the late Ming period--a towering figure in the history of Chinese art-- Tung Ch'i-ch'ang has been portrayed as a man concentrating his energies on artistic pursuits, whose official career was largely irrelevant, despite its considerable role in his life as he lived it. But a careful scrutiny of his career, in conjunction with his writings and works, suggests a different picture: of a man intensely ambitious to win official honors, and adept at securing--through gifts of his paintings and calligraphies, or the favor of his pronouncement as a connoisseur--the goodwill of those who could advance or safeguard his political fortunes. So successfully did he thread his way through the political maze--forming friendships with officials in the Tung-lin movement, with whom his natural sympathies lay (particularly with the chief Grand Secretary of the period, Yeh Hsiang-kao), but also with their opponents in the eunuch party (including such execrated figures as Feng Ch'uan and Chou Yen-ju)-- that by the end of his life he had won, by sheer perseverance, an appointment as Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent, with a rank of 1b, and an imperial patent awarding his title to three generations of his forebears. This biography--which begins with Tung's family connections and early training, and traces the interaction between his career as an official and his evolution as the artistic arbiter of his day--relies extensively on new evidence from the Ming shih-lu (The Veritable Records of the Ming Dynasty) and the Kuo-ch'ueh (An Evaluation of (Events in our) Dynasty) by T'an Ch'ien (1594-1657), key sources previously untapped by art historians. Together they permit the reconstruction of Tung's official career more precisely than was possible before, with a view towards dating more accurately those of his works with office seals. By due emphasis on his political ambition and by identifying works he executed for political friends and acquaintances, I have attempted to illuminate the hidden springs of Tung's character.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Art History, Biographies, History, China",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304592586,"Hinton, Carmelita",A mountain of anomie: Transformations of the soushan tu genre,Medieval,"This study focuses on a genre of Chinese paintings known as soushan tu , which depict a throng of demon-like men charging through wooded mountains to ferret out noxious spirits in human guises. These images and scenes are among the most violent in Chinese art, radically different from the landscape and figure compositions which embody the harmony and elevated dignity extolled by conventional Chinese aesthetic theory. Artistic interest in depicting the mountain-search persisted for nearly a millennium—from the tenth century, when famous artists were said to have painted soushan tu , to the nineteenth century, the latest era for which an example in this genre has been found. Previous scholarship on the subject has assumed that soushan tu illustrate a preexisting story and conclude that the legends surrounding a deity known as Erlang were their original inspiration. This study shows that during the first one hundred years of the Song dynasty, Erlang was regarded by the imperial court as a deity of yinsi (licentious cults) which were to be suppressed. Yet it was precisely during this period that the earliest written references to soushan tu , as well as to court patronage of such paintings, appeared. Although Erlang was later promoted by the Song court as a powerful guardian of the state, he certainly could not have been the subject of these early soushan tu . Literary, as well as early pictorial, evidence point to a gradual process through which the core artistic repertoire of soushan tu scenes developed. They suggest that Bishamen Tianwang (Vaisravana) was the first among a succession of deities that were portrayed in soushan tu . Furthermore, the identity of the commander of the mountain-search varied according to the changing predilections of the imperial court. Despite such variations, the central theme of the soushan tu images remained the same for a millennium: the forces of order marshal a search to locate and expunge demons and other malign influences that threaten cosmic harmony. This study thus concludes that the soushan tu are not illustrations of an identifiable text, but rather they are pictorial works that are historically aligned with a range of similar endeavors which employed various cultural media and ritual acts to establish and defend symbolic regimes related to the maintenance of political power.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Folklore, Anomie, China, Genre, Mountain-search, Soushan tu",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
275923007,"Tseng, Lan-ying",Picturing heaven: Image and knowledge in Han China,Ancient,"This dissertation examines the act of picturing Heaven in the conventions of Han China by exploring the complex interface of image and knowledge. It establishes that there were three visual modes developed by Han artisans to make Heaven visible: first, Heaven could be delineated as simple as a circle that was part of the favorable diagram of the universe. second, Heaven could be represented as complicated as star groups that were taken from charts of the sky. and third, Heaven could be depicted as fantastic as a wonderland that was mostly inspired by celestial myths. Since picturing Heaven during the Han relied heavily on cosmology, astronomy and mythology, this study further investigates how image can be post-production of knowledge, borrowing intellectual achievements while transforming them into pictorial entities. It seeks to clarify that picturing Heaven is not only an act of denotation but also an act of appropriation and modification, deeply involved in the distribution and consumption of celestial knowledge. It also pays close attention to potential agents, mainly illustrated manuals in wide circulation, that bridged experts and artisans, to see how cosmography, celestial cartography and mythography contributed to the emergence of certain visual modes. Moreover, it notices that Han artisans may have used the three modes separately, but they more often incorporated one with another, neglecting incompatibility among cosmology, astronomy and mythology. Their mixed works show either synthesis or syncretism of the introduced prototypes, which was even comparable to contemporary intellectual trends that either systemized or juxtaposed different branches of celestial knowledge. This dissertation thus argues that losing their unity, the cosmological, astronomical and mythological factors in popular use during the Han served the plain function of signs whose denotation and connotation could be arbitrarily assigned and freely combined. By investigating the interplay between visibility and invisibility as revealed in attempts of picturing Heaven, this dissertation hopes to elucidate the visuality of Han China and to add a stimulative to the current fascination with visual culture.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Science history, China, Cosmology, Han dynasty, Heaven, Image, Knowledge, Picturing",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304341483,"Ning, Qiang","Art, religion and politics: Dunhuang Cave 220",Medieval,"This dissertation proposes that the Dunhuang Caves, which form the largest complex of ancient Buddhist art in China, are mainly made for the public. With a public audience in mind, the patrons show their social status, political ideology and personal desire through the paintings and sculptures in the caves. Based on this proposition, I choose Cave 220, built by the local elite Zhai family in 642 AD, as an example to explore the relationship between Buddhist art and Chinese society, particularly the connections between art, religion and politics, during the Tang and Five Dynasties periods (618-960). The paintings on the four walls of Cave 220 were covered by a layer of clay probably in the 10th century, and remained unexposed until the early 1940s. The original early Tang paintings, therefore, are now still very fresh and colorful in comparison to other early Tang Dunhuang murals. As private property of the Zhai family, Cave 220 serves as an offering shrine for family rituals, a personal paradise for the deceased family members, and a political showcase for the living patrons. The ownership of the cave is clearly indicated by a striking inscription written at the center of the front wall and the portraits of donors depicted at both sides of the inscription. This proprietary identification also functions as social, political, and cultural identities of the Zhais, who continued to renovate and use the cave for many generations. This study examines the meaning and function of the original pictorial program of Cave 220 in the early Tang and deciphers the socio-political implications of its later reconstructions within the local-historical context. The significance of the family cave in the studies of social and cultural histories is extensively evaluated. My approach includes textual and visual sources from varied disciplines such as religion, literature, history, politics and popular culture.

I demonstrate that the efforts of officials following an ideology of domination and transformation rooted in the Chinese Classics changed the ways that people associated with each other and defined themselves and how Muslims understood their place in history and in global space. Chinese power is central to the history of modern Xinjiang and to the Uyghur people, not only because the Chinese center has dominated the area as a periphery, but because of the ways in which that power intervened in society and culture on the local level. The processes and ramifications of the Chinese government in late-Qing and early Republican Xinjiang demonstrates strong parallels with colonialism in the context of European empire. This dissertation does not focus on the question of typology, however, but instead draws on methods from colonial history to explore the dynamics of a linguistically and religiously heterogeneous society. In order to do so, I draw on local archival documents in Chinese and Turkic and place them into dialogue with the broader Turkic-language textual record.

304600345,"Mosca, Matthew William","Qing China's perspectives on India, 1750–1847",Modern,"Concentrating on the case of India, this dissertation examines how Qing rulers, officials, and scholars gathered and interpreted information about the outside world, and how this guided actual or proposed policies. It examines official correspondence and private geographic and statecraft scholarship to outline how India was described in various religious and intellectual traditions of the empire, and in intelligence from the Tibetan, Xinjiang, and maritime frontiers. Based on an analysis of Qing geographic methods, strategic thought and bureaucratic procedures, this dissertation argues that the framework guiding perspectives on India shifted between 1750 and 1847 from a frontier policy to the beginnings of a foreign policy. Frontier policy divided the outside world into discrete units tied to a particular frontier, and analyzed them largely according to local informants and sources. Regional differences in terminology and intelligence made it difficult to commensurate all available information into a single picture. However, by the 1840s Chinese statecraft scholars, particularly Wei Yuan, were able to integrate most available geographic information, and on this basis proposed for the first time a foreign policy that put all imperial frontiers to the service of a single strategic end: the destruction of the British empire in India. Chapter One examines knowledge of India circulating within the empire around 1750. Chapter Two examines the views of India held by the Qianlong emperor and his court, and their influence on private scholarship. Chapter Three examines official cartography and its relationship to Jesuit world maps. Collectively, these chapters argue that Qing scholarship was characterized by 'geographic agnosticism,' considering but not wholly endorsing a range of conflicting geographic conceptions, leading to a great variety of idiosyncratic individual worldviews but no basis for a consensus about the outside world. Chapters Four and Five examine the Qing bureaucracy's response to the rise of British India across several frontiers, paying particular attention to the Macartney embassy and its legacy.

613672316,"Kleutghen, Kristina Renee",The Qianlong emperor's perspective: Illusionistic painting in eighteenth-century China,Modern,"During the golden reign of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736–1795), Chinese and European court artists collaborated to create a new painting genre. Combining imported European pictorial techniques with Chinese subjects and materials, these artists created life-size illusionistic paintings called tongjing hua that offered Qianlong opportunities to connect with the painted scenes. Still hidden inside restricted areas of the Forbidden City, these paintings have received little to no study. But the life-size scale and unsurpassed quality of tongjing hua , produced at the height of Sino-European artistic exchange, offer new insights into the private thoughts of the Qianlong emperor. Through exhaustive research in the imperial archives, original translations of imperial poetry, and studies of other eighteenth-century imperial court paintings, tongjing hua are rediscovered in four case studies. Chapter One provides the historical background of European pictorial presence and illusionistic painting in China. Chapter Two examines the omnipresent theme of illusion in Qianlong's court painting through four versions of his inscribed double portrait One or Two . Chapter Three establishes the conceptual foundations of tongjing hua with the Forbidden City's Juanqin Zhai . Chapter Four examines the Pictures of the European Palaces and Waterworks , an album of twenty engravings that provide a visual record of a now-lost tongjing hua . Chapter Five explores the unstudied Qianlong Watching Peacocks in their Prime , notable for its imperial inscription, and connections to Central Asian tribute relationships and Daoist paradise. Chapter Six presents Portrait of Qianlong's Consort with Yongyan as a Child , an unpublished, unstudied tongjing hua with several unique and unprecedented features. Individually, these works express Qianlong's private thoughts about his family, identity, and legacy that are absent from his public self-presentation. As a genre, however, tongjing hua not only enable his personal self-expression relative to a lifelong obsession with visual illusion, but also reflect eighteenth-century China's widespread fascination with European pictoriality that is found throughout its visual culture.

879090710,"Doran, Rebecca Esther",Insatiable Women and Transgressive Authority: Constructions of Gender and Power in Early Tang China,Medieval,"My research explores conceptualizations of female power in late seventh and early eighth century China. The period spanning the second half of the seventh century through 713 represents a unique political-cultural space in Chinese history. During this time, the government was dominated by powerful female figures. I analyze the self-presentations of these women in contemporary court literature and the ways in which they were interpreted and portrayed in historical, semi-historical, and fictional accounts in the decades and centuries after their deaths. I analyze the nature and constitutive elements of their (re)construction as literary-historical figures, focusing on the development of archetypes of their power as women and the gradual consolidation of their images in the overarching narrative of history. My first chapter traces the development of narrative prototypes of female power through detailed analysis of the ways in which earlier female rulers have been portrayed. My second chapter explores the self-image of these women through analysis of the surviving corpus of prose and poetry attributed to them and their courtiers, who were intent on pleasing them through their literary output of praise pieces. The next three chapters treat retrospective constructions of Tang female power-holders in the decades and centuries after their deaths by historians, compilers, and writers. These chapters are organized by theme and deal, respectively, with accounts of their manipulation and/or misinterpretation of cosmic signs, conspicuous consumption and relationships with male consorts. My study moves beyond the issue of historiographical sexist bias to probe the cultural lenses through which gender roles and expectations become rhetorically codified. I attempt a systematic analysis of the way in which these figures have been negotiated in the literary-historical tradition: what they represent in the moral-cosmic schemas forming various historical and literary narratives. how their legitimacy or de-legitimacy as women rulers is interpreted and appropriated by historians and compilers. and how archetypes of gender and power develop over time and influence their portrayals.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Asian Studies, China, Chinese women, Cultural history, Gender construction, Medieval China, Tang dynasty, Transgressive authority",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
915053921,"Leung, Vincent Sueh Han",The Politics of the Past in Early China,Ancient,"This dissertation studies the different uses of the past under the political transition from the Western Zhou aristocratic feudatories to the Qin-Han bureaucratic empires in the first millennium BC. More specifically, it studies the transformations of the past into political capital, and their subsequent mobilization towards the support and critique of various political positions and ideals, in this protracted period of historical transition. It is divided into four chapters, each focused on a set of primary texts in roughly chronological order. The first chapter begins with both received and paleographic sources from the Western Zhou, and argues for the predominance of the genealogical past in this period. The second half of the chapter turns to sections of the Analects and the Mozi from the sixth- and fifth-century BC, and argues for their common disavowal of the genealogical past, the alternatives that they each came up with, and the politics that each alternative implies. Chapter two turns to the late Warring States in the fourth- and third-century BC, focusing in particular on the complex relationship between the idea of laws and history in the Legalist tradition. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the Qin imperial ideology, which radicalized the Legalist paradigm for a vision of itself as the end of history. Chapter three studies the representations of the past in the writings of two early Han officials, Lu Jia and Jia Yi, from the first few decades of the second-century BC, as responses to the problematic legacy of the Qin empire. Finally, in chapter four, I study the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) by Sima Qian from around the turn of the first-century BC as a work of critical intervention, by way of its complex historical narratives, into what he understood to be the perils of early Han imperialism.

304891347,"Wangling, Jinghua",Singing lips in observation: Ninth-century Chinese poetry on female entertainers,Contemporary,"Ninth-century Chinese poetry on female entertainers (abbreviated to entertainers) not only serves as an important source of our knowledge about entertainers and the entertainment system in pre-modern China, but also provides a new perspective through which to view ninth-century Chinese literature and culture. Due to the limited number of historical records, poetry and anecdotes are the key sources for our knowledge about the entertainment culture of the ninth century. Through a literary, historical, and cultural examination of ninth-century entertainers' attributes, the entertainment system, entertainment culture, and poetry on entertainers, my dissertation investigates the reasons why entertainers became such an important topic in poetry during this period. The matured examination system in the capital, the rising local economic, political, and military power, the special relationship between poets and entertainers all account for ninth-century poets' interest in writing about entertainers. While such poetry functioned as advertisements for entertainers and sometimes even contained economic value, it also helped poets establish and spread their poetic reputation, which could yield them success in the examination system, wealth, promotions, and even women. I argue that by writing about entertainers, ninth-century poets not only exhibited their fengliu (romantically devoted, sentimental, gallant, or humorous) poetic personalities, which were highly valued in romantic culture and helped them achieve literary immortality, but also constructed their self-images as professional poets. Ninth-century poets' skill in dealing with the contradictions between direct experience or true feeling and poetic exhibition, between novel topics and poetic conventions, between immediate expression (simple or even colloquial diction) and deliberate poetic craft (parallelism, metaphors, or allusions) displays a complexity surpassing that of their predecessors. Due to the contingencies and accidents during the process of poem transmission, ninth-century poems about entertainers have encountered many authorship problems. However, ninth-century poetry and ninth-century poets who have been remembered for their fengliu poetic personalities collectively reflect the growing importance of romantic culture during this period and have exerted a far-reaching influence on poetry (including song lyrics), dramas, and novels of subsequent periods.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, China, Du Mu, Entertainers, Ninth century, Poet, Poetry, Tang",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

It is a small collection of 60-67 coloured images paired with heptasyllabic quatrains, which claim to foretell the rises and falls of Chinese dynasties. The work is extraordinarily long-lived and notorious. Since its inception down to the very present, the T'ui-pei-t'u has fascinated readers as diverse as rulers and rebels. attracting a readership among religious sectarians as well as European missionaries, while travelling freely the unschooled fringes of local society as well as the academic worlds of scholars and intellectuals. Despite early classification as a heretical, ch'an-wei text, and repeated efforts of rulers from Sung through Ch'ing to eliminate it, the T'ui-pei-t'u continued to flourish as a secretly produced and disseminated work. This is therefore specifically a study of the T'ui-pei-t'u which traces its formal and substantive roots to the ancient t'ung-yao and ch'an-wei traditions of political prophecy, and its affiliation with the popular yu-yen of today. Its connection with other mantic traditions involving pictures and verses is also considered, as is the historical context which influenced the artistic and substantive choices which went into the compilation of the work. More broadly, this is a study of the culture and particular world view which informed the distinctive shape and form of the T'ui-pei-t'u, and which in turn ensured its popularity over the years. It is a culture whose unique relationship with its written language and regard for its written character manifests in a wide range of linguistic games, riddles, word divination, and rebuses, which the T'ui-pei-t'u combines in a divinational format.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, China, Li Ch'un feng, Y\\""""""""uan T'ien kang",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304240074,"Lowry, Kathryn Anne",The transmission of popular song in the late Ming,Modern,"This work examines the transmission of so-called popular songs (shidiao xiaoqu) from the Wanli reign period (1573-1617) to the end of the Ming dynasty in 1645. It was a time when printing and a vibrant economy which afforded leisure activity made such works accessible to many social levels. The literatus Feng Menglong (1574-1646) played a critical role in articulating the literary value of popular song. The way he advanced that claim demonstrates concerns with genuineness (zhen) and the unselfconscious operation of sentiment that are peculiar to the late Ming. This study joins literary analysis to intellectual history in order to address the debate over the role of the elite in popular culture. Basing myself on song texts in miscellanies printed roughly fifty years before the popular song anthologies edited by Feng Menglong and on analysis of the arrangement and circumstances of production of these books, I contend that highly literate (non-elite) editors and printers collaborated on commercial publications of song that appeal to a cross-section of readers. Comparison of such sources with elite treatments of song texts demonstrates how materials were reproduced for different readerships and uses. The organization of this study, in five chapters, is as follows: the introductory chapter discusses primary sources of popular song, differentiating the level and types of publications and their possible use as songbooks from which to choose works for performance. The second chapter establishes the philosophical and social context for elite treatments of so-called popular forms by examining Feng Menglong's Preface to Shan'ge and other writings on song. Each of the following chapters focuses on a particular song or songs and some aspect of transmission. Chapter Three examines Ming music scholarship and considers how tune names were known and used by looking at the case of two, 'Pipo yu' and 'Guazhi'er,' which are said to be distinct tunes and yet are applied to the same song texts in different books. The final two chapters show how Feng Menglong's revisions and comments on popular song texts in Guazhi'er and Shan'ge reflect late-Ming interests in genuineness and the fascination with authentic language and moral sentiment, as exemplified in the 'Shan'ge' texts in Wu dialect.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Theater, China",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304193096,"Volpp, Sophie Ann Justine",The male queen: Boy actors and literati libertines,Contemporary,"This dissertation, entitled The Male Queen: Boy Actors and Literati Libertines, investigates the relations between actors and literati in seventeenth- century China. This study contributes to our understanding of the lives of the literati of the Ming-Qing transition, the cultural milieu of the theater of this period, and late-imperial conceptions of gender and sexuality. In order to establish a conceptual framework with which to understand the erotic liaisons between actors and literati, I analyze the representation of homoeroticism in seventeenth-century texts. Scholars have argued that in late- imperial China the elite male was bisexual, displaying a blindness to gender in his sexual preference. I argue that although individuals did engage in both homoerotic and heteroerotic behavior without a sense of internal conflict, the two modes were still at odds. The battle was not for the soul or psyche of an individual but in a more abstracted rivalry and mimicry of forms. I suggest that we provisionally adopt the playful description in these sources of sexuality as a Way (Dao) in order to explain the syncretic relationship in this period between homoeroticism and heteroeroticism. The representation of male love both appropriates the conventions of heteroerotic romance and contests them, borrowing these conventions in order to supersede them. The rivalry between the two Ways takes the form of a contest between the sexes in Wang Jide's northern drama (zaju) The Male Queen. The play pits a boy endowed with natural femininity against the palace women of the King of Linchuan. The text engages in complex games with its own theatricality, creating a parallel between the boy's seduction of the King and the actor's seduction of the spectator. The boy outranks the members of the female sex because he, like the actor, has the power to improvise his gender, controlling illusion and representation. I establish a context for The Male Queen by examining poems written in tribute to boy actors, focusing on poems that document the passion between the literatus Chen Weisong and the actor Yunlang. Drawing upon the theoretical models of Rene Girard and Eve Sedgwick, I argue that these poems fashioned bonds among literati by negotiating the transfer of rights to the actor. The literatus's expression of desire for the actor is part flattery and part jest, prompted by the demands of the composition of occasional poetry. These poems follow The Male Queen in portraying the actor as an icon of femininity. The stories of the anonymous collection Hairpins Beneath a Cap extend this argument, claiming that the feminine actor is superior to the female sex not merely because of his erotic charms but because he is more capable of loyalty and chastity than the members of the female sex. In arguing that the actor makes a superior woman, these stories seek to demonstrate that erotic relationships between men are capable of fulfilling the demands of Confucian ethics in a world in which women no longer uphold traditional moral codes.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Theater, China, actors",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304598846,"Aviv, Eyal",Differentiating the pearl from the fish eye: Ouyang Jingwu (1871–1943) and the revival of scholastic Buddhism,Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the rise of Buddhist scholasticism in Republican China (1911-1949) through the career of one of its most outspoken leaders, Ouyang Jingwu (1871-1943). Ouyang Jingwu, a lay Buddhist intellectual, charismatic teacher and polemical writer, is most recognized for his critique of the East Asian Buddhist tradition, a critique that stands at the heart of the dissertation. In addition to presenting this critique, this dissertation will explore one of the most innovative hermeneutical alternatives offered by this influential and creative thinker. To date, the importance of Ouyang for later intellectual developments has been overlooked by scholars. I argue here that understanding Ouyang's critique is crucial for later developments in Chinese intellectual history both within and without Buddhism. The first chapter of this dissertation outlines Ouyang's biography, in order to provide a broader intellectual context. The second and third chapters discuss Ouyang's critique of the East Asian tradition. Chapter three surveys the problems Ouyang identified in the East Asian Buddhist tradition, while Chapter four highlights the core problem, in Ouyang's view, which is the spuriousness of the Awakening of Faith ( Dasheng qixin lun ). Finally, the fifth chapter introduces one of Ouyang's most controversial and idiosyncratic solutions to the problems he identified in the tradition, his Two Paradigms theory. My dissertation concludes that Ouyang's alternatives posed one of the greatest challenges to traditional Chinese thought in the modern period. It offered a systematic critique, based on the medieval Indian Buddhist scholastic tradition. Later attempts to adapt traditional Chinese thought to the modern period, such as those by Buddhist apologists and the rise of the influential New Confucian movement, are closely linked to the scholastic Buddhist movement. It is impossible to understand the former without understanding the latter.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Biographies, Religion, History, Awakening of Faith (Qixin lun), Buddhism, China, Intellectual history, Modern Chinese intellectual history, Ouyang, Jingwu, Taixu, Yogacara (Weishi)",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
612811250,"McKeown, Arthur Philip","From Bodhgayā to Lhasa to Beijing: The life and times of Śāriputra (c.1335–1426), last abbot of Bodhgayā",Modern,"The terminus ante quem for Indian Buddhism is commonly held to be the mid-thirteenth century. This study demonstrates that this position is no longer tenable by providing the first detailed examination of the life of the fifteenth century Indian Buddhist monk, Śāriputra (1335–1426), through biographical, historical, and material evidence of his travels from India through Nepāl and Tibet, and finally to the Ming Imperial court. This dissertation analyzes Śāriputra's Tibetan and Chinese biographies, which portray startlingly different personalities—from the ethically observant abbot of Vajrāsana to the transgressive, nātha -influenced tantrika. In both roles, he reconstituted Buddhist systems of meaning in India, and garnered royal patronage wherever he traveled. One of the major methodological problems with which this study grapples is the possibility of harvesting historical information from literary sources. A close consideration of Śāriputra's life provides a window into fifteenth century Buddhism in India, Nepāl, Tibet, and China, reveals the fascination that Buddhist India still exerted for these countries which had largely stopped traveling there. The site that wielded particular interest for both Indian and non-Indian Buddhists was the locus of the Buddha's Awakening—and the center of the Buddhist world—Vajrāsana. In many respects, Śāriputra's influence derives from his intimate relationship with Vajrāsana. This study therefore demonstrates not only that Indian Buddhism survived into the fifteenth century and beyond, but also reveals what it looked like to one witness and his many interlocutors. Buddhism was unquestionably on the wane, but this decline was punctuated by moments of revival and reconstitution. With records like those pertaining to Śāriputra, new avenues of research are available into Indian Buddhist interactions with their Muslim counterparts, Buddhist exile literature, and more.

3230000050,"Fitzgerald, Devin T. ",The Ming Open Archive and the Global Reading of Early Modern China,Pre-modern,"In this dissertation I demonstrate the entangled relationship between the information practices of the Ming state and the global circulation of information about China in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This dissertation shows that the domestic context for information production and consumption during the Ming influenced how different actors around the globe understood Chinese empire and planted the seeds for the development of a global field of Sinology. Part one of this dissertation, consisting of Chapters One through Four, argues that the Ming information order contributed to the rise of different forms of compilations of state documents written to addresses problems of governance in the Ming empire. In the first two chapters, I demonstrate how the central state established new standards for government compilations. These standards came to be adapted by scholars who imagined themselves as authors who represented the state’s interests. In Chapters Three and Four, I argue that the late Ming publishing boom during a period open factional conflict undermined the ability of scholars to collate and confirm information from different compilations about the state. The inability to confirm information led to the erosion of trust in documentary ‘truth,’ and contributed the emergence of early Qing narratives which blamed factionalism for the end of the empire. Part two of the dissertation demonstrates how texts produced within the Ming about the empire spread around the globe during the sixteenth and seventh centuries to provide some of the majors sources of information about “China.” Chapters Five and Six show how Chinese texts circulated in the early modern world. As these texts circulated, ideas about China gradually converged around contemporary understanding of the Ming empire. Scholars in Korea, Europe, and Japan viewed China as a “Confucian” state which was home to ethnic Chinese who were constantly threatened by steppe invaders. Chapters Seven and Eight describe how these discourses about China informed global reactions to the Manchu invasion of the empire. I show how Ming Sino-centricity created the context for Korean and Japanese rejection of Qing legitimacy, while the Qing use of Ming institutions convinced European scholars that the new dynasty was further evidence of China’s “ancient” institutions persevering in the face of change. The convergences and divergences around the idea of China were the result of the emergence of an early global field of Sinology.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Book history, Global history, Ming history, Sinology, Ming state, Seventeenth century, Sixteenth century,",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
3180000049,"Ying, Lei","Shadows of Karma: Buddhism, Literature, and the Modern Chinese Revolution",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the Buddhist contribution to an overlapping series of revolutions in late nineteenth-century to mid-twentieth-century China, through the lens of literature and thought. Whereas the received narrative of China’s nation building remains a secular story in which few religious figures or undertakings have a part, I argue otherwise. Bridging entrenched disciplinary boundaries, my study probes into the nexus of literature, politics, and religion to bring to light a revolution of the mind that dwells at the core of the Chinese quest for modernity. It attempts a paradigmatic rethinking of “revolution” and “enlightenment,” the two intertwining themes of modern China, by unpacking the variegated hues—secular as well as Buddhist—in the profoundly compelling goal of “enlightenment” to a wide spectrum of Chinese intellectuals. This study illuminates a shared horizon of meaning between Buddhism-inspired progressive intellectuals (such as Liang Qichao and Lu Xun) and reform-minded Buddhists (such as Taixu and Ouyang Jingwu), at a juncture of radical epistemic openness in the midst of escalating momentum for change. The religious concerns of the former, who were not formally affiliated with any religious institution, have so far been overlooked in the study of modern Chinese literary and intellectual history; whereas the latter tend to be positioned in a distinctive heritage running parallel to, but nonetheless separate from, mainstream Chinese culture. This study seeks to dispel the secularist myopia in the existing paradigm that prevents us from seeing the manifold interactions and affinities between the two groups, as they joined hands and sought a cure for what Lu Xun, the iconic writer of modern China, diagnosed as China’s “spiritual disease.” In delineating the Buddhist face of modern Chinese literature, my work unveils at the same time a different, and revolutionary, face of modern Chinese Buddhism.

Using technical print culture and firm archives (William Fairbairn, James Nasmyth, Cockerill, Baldwin Locomotive Works, Pratt & Whitney, William Sellers & Co., Borsig, Gutehoffnungshütte, Ludwig Loewe & Co. Mannesmann, Maschinenfabrik Augsburg- Nürnberg, J.E. Reinecker), the work demonstrates how the shifting locus of control within firms recast the interests and institutions of international trade in capital goods. Whereas British authorities had attempted to police flows of machinery and crafts knowledge embodied in artisans at the beginning of the nineteenth century, German and American capital goods firms would compete to export machine tools globally by its end. Critical to this shift, drafting techniques developed by French Revolutionary mathematician Gaspard Monge spread transnationally via mechanics institutes and military academies, polytechnics and print culture. Before the advent of Taylorism, engineering employers used design techniques to displace control over work processes from the shop-floor to the drafting room starting in the U.S. Civil War. Philadelphia economist Henry Carey and self-styled “industrial publisher” Henry Carey Baird advocated not only tariffs salutary to the engineering industries but also Greenbacks, free banking, and cheap credit to facilitate the expansion of the capital goods manufacturers and enable trade with debtor states in the South and West. In the deflationary crisis of the 1870s to 1890s, engineering works employed techniques of depiction to redefine industrial labor and industrial property toward a “second enclosure” of knowledge. The things in between, drawings and models were valuated in insurance logs and eventually depreciated on firm balance sheets. Looking forward in another sense, firms amortized increasingly multi-national patent accounts in the wake of the 1883 Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. In Imperial Germany, white-collar technical workers unionized to seek individual patent rights against the claims of engineering employers to firm-based intellectual property based on arguments about the organicism of the modern corporation—eventually extending to all activities within a firm, beyond those amenable to drawing. The dissertation concludes with a case study of capital goods exports to late Qing and Republican China, focused on the German “model colony” of Qingdao and railroad projects such as the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Engineering interests established technical schools and engaged in debates over currency reform, central banking, and the standardization of measures and technical components.

4130000068,"Yu, Wen",The Search for a Chinese Way in the Modern World: From the Rise of Evidential Learning to the Birth of Chinese Cultural Identity,Contemporary,"This dissertation explains how the search for a Chinese cultural identity became central to China’s debates over shared values in the twentieth century. Challenging the mainstream view that the rise of modern Chinese national thought was a product of Western-style modernization, I argue that proposals to construct a Chinese cultural identity in the early twentieth century were first and foremost concerned with the sources of elite values and the role of elite culture. Key to this historiographical revision is the excavation of the link between twentieth century nationalist thinkers and seventeenth century Evidential Learning. Nationalist thinkers were the intellectual descendants of Evidential Learning and adopted its conviction that China’s own cumulative cultural traditions, rather than the universal moral principles of the Neo-Confucians, should be the basis for the values of the intellectual-political elite. They aimed to restore the Qing Evidential Learning tradition as the basis for China’s new post-imperial civic and moral life, and they believed that the Evidential Learning tradition’s historical approach to the definition of values would allow scholars to engage with new concepts from abroad while preserving the authority of their own cultural traditions that was fundamental to intellectual elites’ cultural and political agency in China’s new post-imperial society. This dissertation contributes to a deeper understanding of the ideological foundations of modern China, by showing how debates within Confucian literati learning traditions played a significant role in China’s modern transition. Reconstructing the intellectual history from the seventeenth century to the twentieth century and examining the key corpus of major thinkers in context, I unearth a profound but largely neglected ideological debate between the Evidential Learning conception of shared values as a historical product of a “Chinese” cultural community and the imperial Neo-Confucian conception of values as universalistic and predetermined moral doctrines. Uncovering how modern Chinese nationalist thinkers were both historically and philosophically connected to this debate, I disclose the historical meanings of modern Chinese nationalism, reveal alternative political models that were not chosen, and contribute to the ongoing discussions over China’s modern condition and the future of China’s political identity.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,History,History,"Chinese nationalism, Confucianism, Cultural identity, Chinese history,",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

This dissertation is at the intersection of three fields: the study of Japan’s empire, materiality and expertise, and the modern history in East Asia. It shows that Japanese colonial technicians and officials extensively observed and absorbed local practices and vernacular knowledge in terms of material production and ownership, and further translated this local knowledge into their colonial expertise to consolidate Japan’s hegemony in Manchuria. Also, borrowing the theory of “assemblages,” the dissertation redefines our understanding of expertise. Instead of seeing expertise as a quality that Japanese technicians and officials developed before their arrival to Manchuria, the dissertation shows how Japanese colonial expertise grew out of the interactions between Japanese colonial officials and technicians and the local society, as well as the natural environment during the process of infrastructure building. Last but not least, with a focus on railway auxiliary zones, the dissertation shows the indirect influence of Japan’s empire building on other Chinese administrative regions, shaping their imagination of cities and their understanding of modernity.

915644227,"Sibau, Maria Franca",Reading for the Moral: Exemplarity and Heroism in “Xinshi yan” (1632) and the “Fiction of Moral Duty”,Modern,"This dissertation studies the representation of moral virtues in vernacular story collections published at the very end of the Ming. These texts include Xingshi yan (Exemplary Words for the Ming, 1632) and Qingye zhong (Alarum Bell in a Still Night, 1645) by the brothers Lu Renlong and Lu Yunlong of Hangzhou. In these stories, the authors explore the meaning of perennial values such as filiality, loyalty, and chastity by looking at actual figures and episodes of the Ming as models for action. Through a combination of close reading and a discussion of the larger literary, intellectual, and historical context, I examine the nexus between moral exemplarity and historical contingency, and I seek to offer a more nuanced understanding of these texts, one that calls into question the use of generic rubrics such as conventional morality to describe their moral dimension. The Introduction provides an overview of the story collections, the Lu brothers, and their publishing activity. The dissertation is comprised of six chapters. Using the five normative bonds ( wu lun ) as categories to organize my discussion, I examine the ways in which moral exemplarity is constructed in each case. In Chapter One I look at the central virtue of filial piety, by focusing on three main themes that inform the fictional representations of filial exemplars: filial quest, filial dilemmas, and filial bodies. In Chapter Two and Three I discuss representations of loyalty and chastity respectively. Chapter Four examines the representation of brotherly love through the analysis of stories of exemplary as well as estranged brothers. Chapter Five discusses stories of exemplary friends by situating them against the backdrop of the late Ming discourse on friendship.

614074012,"Thum, Rian Richard",The sacred routes of Uyghur history,Modern,"The Sacred Routes of Uyghur History traces the formation of the popular historical tradition among the Uyghurs, the settled Turkic-speaking Muslims of Altishahr (Xinjiang, China), through a body of texts which have remained mostly unpublished. While the Uyghurs inherited much of the wider Islamic world's historiography, during the two and a half centuries in which they have been subject to China-based rule they have also reshaped the Islamic tradition to explain their own origins. This study focuses in particular on the ways in which, during that period, ordinary Uyghurs have learned about and experienced the past. It argues that the flexibility of manuscript technology, which remained the dominant form of publishing into the 1930s, allowed for the participation of a vast community in the production and reproduction of knowledge about the past. At the same time, the manuscript was only effective insofar as it was deployed in rich social contexts, most notably the recitations that were a part of pilgrimage to local Islamic shrines. Thus, the study's approach to the Uyghur historical tradition is necessarily multi-disciplinary, not just examining the texts themselves, but also relying on ethnographic fieldwork to guide investigation of the social contexts in which history was practiced. The texts, in turn, are subjected to close readings, but also treated as physical objects, which provide clues about how historical works were used. Based on such evidence, it is argued that the manuscript tradition, when deployed across the routes of pilgrimage, permitted the development of the Uyghurs' shared view of the past into an imagined community before the arrival of nationalist worldviews.

By living and traveling with rural nomads during my eighteen months of dissertation research (1998, 1999–2000) I sought to understand why the proliferation of shamanic practices after socialism became an integral part of daily life of Buriats. My focus is to show that the cultural practices and imaginings of people in the most remote corners of the world are connected with the larger power. Mongolia's “internal” politics, particularly state violence, were influenced by the geopolitical domination by Russia and China. In response to multiple dominations, the Buriats have constructed a Celestial Court—the ruling hierarchy of spirits and gods in the time-transcendent celestial realm. By way of a journey to the Celestial Court I trace the Buriats' tragic history of colonialism and marginalization. The abuses by the state are most vividly realized by women in their subjective transformations towards becoming shamanic practitioners. By exploring the discrepancy between egalitarian ideals and the actual gendered hierarchy in the acquisition of powers by male and female shamans I problematize the issue of female empowerment and subordination both during socialism and after its collapse. The marginalized women, in particular, have developed creative non-conventional strategies for dealing with the repercussions of the state abuses by challenging the established norms of gender. The tragic stories of both male and female shamans and the rituals of healing and deflecting misfortunes offer mechanisms for defetishizing the state.

304889973,"Ho, Denise Yuet-Shu",Antiquity in revolution: Cultural relics in twentieth -century Shanghai,Contemporary,"In twentieth-century China, cultural relics came to symbolize the authenticity and legitimacy of the state. This dissertation studies how cultural relics, or wenwu , were defined from China's Republican period (1912-1949) through the People's Republic (1949-) into the present day. While China's imperial rulers used cultural relics to demonstrate legitimate succession, the paradox facing any new regime in the twentieth century was that its claim to political legitimacy was based on both revolution and historical continuity. Taking Shanghai as its case study, Antiquity in Revolution examines this political tension through the authentication, nationalization, and display of cultural relics. This history of the city's arts and monuments explores how such relics have produced and supported national narratives. This dissertation draws upon the records of the Shanghai Bureau of Culture. Building upon the regulations and rhetoric from the Republican period, the People's Republic established institutions to control cultural relics and their interpretation. In addition to using antiquity to define New China, these institutions also designated revolutionary places, including the site of the First Communist Party Congress. The state's cultural bureaucracy also reached into the lives of local people, creating neighborhood exhibitions, defining cultural relics within temple spaces, and regulating art trade to nationalize private collections. Despite the state's claims to mastery over the past, however, the cultural institutions remained politically fraught. the questions of whether museum officials were to be red or expert, how the history of the revolution was told, and who should define and own cultural relics demonstrate that the Party was not the sole claimant on culture or its definition. Until the Cultural Revolution antiquity and revolution managed to coexist. But Mao's Smash the Four Olds campaign rejected the past. and in this context cultural officials had to reframe preservation by representing it as a revolutionary act. The enduring resonance of cultural relics to Chinese identity is reaffirmed in the cultural nationalism of today's globalizing China. But the tension between antiquity and revolution persists as the People's Republic, founded in revolution, seeks to integrate itself into China's longer historical narrative by redefining legitimate succession in the interest of the present Chinese nation-state.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Antiquity, China, Cultural relics, Monuments, Museums, Revolution, Shanghai",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305608436,"Li, Ruohong",A Tibetan aristocratic family in eighteenth-century Tibet: A study of Qing -Tibetan contact,Contemporary,"This dissertation is a case study on the Manchu Qing-Tibetan contacts during the eighteenth century by investigating the precarious political career of one of the most eminent Tibetan aristocratic families in central Tibet, the Rdo ring (or Dga' bzhi) family. Drawing upon multi-lingual first-hand sources, mainly Rdo ring Bstan 'dzin dpal 'byor's autobiography, this research intends to shed new light on the connections between Tibetan lay aristocrats and Qing officials on the official as well as personal level. Utilizing the current research trend of micro-historical approach, the Rdo ring family's political career in four generations will be put into the context of eighteen-century Qing and Tibetan politics and the change of Qing court policy in ruling Tibet. The rise and fall of the Rdo ring family throughout the eighteenth century reflects the change of Qing Tibetan policy. The Rdo ring family emerged as eminent Tibetan aristocrats as a result of the Qing's early pro-lay aristocracy policy following the Dzungar incursion to Tibet and Tibetan civil war. The ascent of the family political power was greatly attributed to the strong tie that Pho lha nas had with the Qing court. In the late eighteenth century, the downturn of the Rdo ring family's political power signaled serious and fundamental problems in Qing Tibetan policy. Lay aristocracy failed the court. the Dalai Lama's dominant power both in the political and religious realms cannot ensure a balanced power structure, and regency was not reliable in face of chaotic situation. The Qing court was left with no other choices but to turn to its own ambans . This research concludes that the ultimate failure of Qing Tibetan policy resulted from the temporary and opportunistic features of the policies themselves, the inefficiency of the amban system and the decline of the Qing empire as a whole that started from the late eighteenth century. The Qing suzerainty over Tibet was largely wishful thinking. Deeply troubled by the overall imperial administrative laxity and socioeconomic disturbances in all aspects, Tibet was left out of the major picture of the Qing empire in the post-Qianlong era. The decline of the Rdo ring family epitomizes the Qing-Tibetan contacts and the change of the Qing Tibetan policy in the eighteenth century.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Aristocracy, China, Eighteenth century, Qing-Tibetan contact, Tibet",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
614068174,"Sung, Chia-fu",Between tortoise and mirror: Historians and historiography in eleventh-century China,Modern,"This dissertation takes the conventional wisdom that Sima Guang's Zizhi tongjian ( Comprehensive mirror to aid in government ) was the most important and consequential achievement of eleventh-century Song historiography as the point of departure. A re-examination of the compiling history of the Comprehensive Mirror , however, reveals the intriguingly antithetical relationship Sima Guang held against the official historiography in general and the historical encyclopedia Cefu yuangui in particular. Chapter one proposes to view the official historiography as a mode of historiographical operation in the sense that it had its own place, procedure and product in the Song institutional and cultural context. Chapter two explores the historiographical significance of the Cefu yuangui as a continuing and creative development in the convention of official historiographical operation. The Cefu rewrote both the practically oriented leishu and the received Standard Histories into a taxonomical comprehensive history of lidai junchen shiji. Chapter three turns to the two  New  Histories by Ouyang Xiu. Both were rewritings based on the existing Standard Histories , and yet the stark contrast between one being consistently official and the other being intentionally kept non-official indicated Ouyang's ambivalent role of being both an insider and outsider in relation to the contemporary official historiographical operation. As a matter of interpretation, his  New  Histories were actually old to the extent that both went beyond the later examples of Standard Histories and reached back to the generic quintet of the great Han dynasty historian Sima Qian's Shiji. Chapter four excavates a hitherto rarely studied historical text Gu shi , whose intensive inter-textual relationship with the Shiji and other works by its author Su Che conspicuously embodies the ambiguities of the practice of re(-)writing in Song historiographical discourse. It is such a special kind of rewriting that I call it over-writing. In the Conclusion I have come around to revisit Sima Guang's Comprehensive Mirror in light of the historiographical constellations construed by the preceding chapters. In terms of its (1) resistance to be conditioned by the place (and the culture associated with it) of Guange , (2) development of un-official procedures of efficient teamwork, and (3) textual product in the neither-categorical-nor-biographical format of critical chronology, the Comprehensive Mirror has presented itself as one of its own mode of historiographical operation in the eleventh-century Song China.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, China, Chinese history, Comparative historiography, Historiographical operation, Historiography, Song Dynasty, Song history",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
815848607,"Zhang, Lawrence Lok Cheung","Power for a price: Office purchase, elite families, and status maintenance in Qing China",Contemporary,"This dissertation revises prevalent conceptions of social hierarchy and political access in Qing China (1644-1911) through an analysis of the officially sanctioned office purchase (Ch. juanna ) system that was in effect for most of the Qing dynasty after 1665. Synthesizing evidence from a wide range of materials, including central government policy files, sales data records, and private documents, this work argues that the presence of a significant group of officials who did not hold degrees from the civil service examination system requires historians to revisit long-held assumptions about the nature of political access and elite status in Qing China. Specifically, this dissertation argues that, contrary to assumptions that social mobility was predicated mainly upon scholarly achievement, possession of liquid wealth was a critical prerequisite for attaining as well as maintaining social status and prestige, even for those who succeeded in the examinations. Office purchase also influenced the Qing bureaucracy and society at large by simultaneously expanding and homogenizing the pool of candidates for official service. The results after surveying personnel files from the central government of over 1,600 officials reveal that upwards of 50% of those sampled in the nineteenth century used office purchase to enter the bureaucracy without direct certification through the civil service examinations, which undermines the conventional supposition that only degree holders could become officials. Also, an analysis of national and regional data on over 10,000 buyers shows that the socioeconomic backgrounds of individuals purchasing offices in the Qing was similar to persons who were likely successful participants in the examinations. Office purchase was therefore a guaranteed means for access to government positions, mitigating previous studies' claims that a family was subject to downward social mobility through failure in examinations. In this context, material wealth was more than simply a resource that facilitated other means and markers. Rather, it was an important tool in itself for status preservation. Although it was widely criticized as an unethical way of bureaucratic recruitment, throughout the Qing office purchase not only increased state revenue but also permitted individuals to parlay their economic assets into instruments of securing political and social status.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, China, Political access, Qing dynasty, Social hierarchy",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

It examines the Qing legal codes and official histories as well as the banner people's private works, in particular their genealogical records, to explore four different yet correlated family activities: the selection of clan heads, the inheritance of hereditary positions, the compilations of genealogical records, and the adoption of heirs. Acknowledging the incessant absorption by the Manchu state and the banner people of the concepts and practices explicitly identified with the Chinese culture. the dissertation contends that this absorption resulted from the Manchu state's desire to solve the problems in banner society, including the decline of the Manchu warrior spirit by being stained by Chinese custom, the conflicts among the banner family or clan members over the inheritance of hereditary positions, the non-credibility of genealogical records compiled individually, and the financial difficulty in maintaining the Eight Banner system.

1502868694,"Levey, Benjamin Samuel","Jungar refugees and the making of empire on Qing China's Kazakh frontier, 1759-1773",Modern,"This dissertation tells the story of what happened to Jungar refugees on the Qing empire's Kazakh frontier in the years immediately following the collapse of the Jungar confederation, 1759-1773. Narratives of violence have dominated the historiography on the fall of the Jungars. Nearly every history of the Jungars' demise highlights the Qing's violent massacres against the Jungar people, with several works even asserting these massacres were tantamount to genocide. Based on a large corpus of previously unstudied Manchu documents, this dissertation moves beyond historical narratives that view the Jungar collapse solely through the lens of Qing violence by highlighting the important historical role that Jungar refugees played in the years following the disintegration of the Jungar state. The dissertation makes three main arguments. First, it argues that Jungar refugees were essential agents in the making of Qing empire on the frontier, serving the Qing as fonts of information on the geography and politics of Central Eurasia, as translators, map-makers, and even as spies. Second, this dissertation demonstrates that the Qing court continued to worry about the threat that Jungar refugees posed to Qing rule in the Jungar lands. The Qing's public proclamations stressed the completeness and finality of the Qing's victory, but the Qianlong emperor and his closest advisors privately worried that Jungar refugees could foment a rebellion against Qing rule over a decade after the Jungar confederation's demise. Third, this dissertation places the fall of the Jungars into the broader context of Central Eurasian history. Previous histories of the Jungar collapse take a Qing-centric perspective that views the fall of the Jungars solely in terms of the longstanding Qing-Jungar conflict. This dissertation argues that any consideration of the fate of Jungar refugees must take into account the legacy of a century of violence and warfare between the Jungars and their enemy in the west, the Kazakhs.

Sayyid 'Ajall Shams al-Din (Saidianchi) was the name of the young boy and he was to become one of the most important military and administrative leaders in the Yuan dynasty, the first civilian governor of the province of Yunnan, and one of the most influential individuals in the history of Islam in China. The story of the life of Sayyid 'Ajall is a fascinating combination of fact and folklore. He is considered an almost mythical character by both the Muslims of China and the indigenous population of Yunnan. His extensive service under the Mongols was characterized by his extraordinarily humanitarian approach to governing. In addition, during his tenure as governor of Yunnan, he showed an unprecedented commitment to improving the lives of the local peoples.

1750996896,"Keliher, Macabe","The Manchu transformation of XXXX: Ritual, politics, and law in the making of Qing China, 1631-1690",Modern,"In 1631, Manchu state-makers set up an administrative apparatus that included a ministry for implementing and legislating li (often translated as rites or ritual), the Board of Li. Over the next sixty years the Board of Li helped develop the rules and regulations of the Manchu state, which were codified in an administrative code in 1690. This dissertation looks at the role of li and the Board of Li in early Manchu state-making efforts, and finds that li was more than simply rituals and ceremonies, it was intimately tied to the formation of politics and administration. The dissertation argues that from 1631 to 1690, state-makers developed the practices of li as sociopolitical and cultural systems that made possible a unified political order that embraced disparate ethnic groups and facilitated the conquest and rule of a multiethnic empire, the Qing, which ruled China and parts of Eurasia from 1636 to 1911. It finds that contrary to conventional understanding, the Manchu practices of li were not copied from the Ming, nor were they inherently Chinese. rather, in response to the immediate political and social circumstances of the time, the Manchus remade and reimagined li through ritual, politics, and law. This argument is made in three parts. Part one demonstrates the indeterminate nature of li and how it could be employed for different state building projects in different periods of Chinese history. part two looks at the Manchu transformation of li through political struggles for power, and the process of the formation of laws and practices to regulate the political settlements. part three takes up the codification of li, and examines the emergent system of political order and administrative law. These three parts further build upon recent insights into the nature of the Qing as a multiethnic, expansionist empire, and show that the Manchus developed li in their construction of an inclusive political culture and administrative apparatus that enabled the Qing to succeed where previous conquest dynasties had failed in the building and running of a multiethnic empire.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"History, Board of Li, China, Law, Manchus, Qing Dynasty, Rituals",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305336516,"Dawley, Evan Nicholas",Constructing Taiwanese ethnicity: Identities in a city on the border of China and Japan,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the historical construction of local, ethnic, and national identities, and the creation of a new Taiwanese ethnicity, in the port city of Jilong (Keelung), Taiwan, focusing on the period of Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945) and its immediate aftermath. Taiwan's historical development occurred within the context of the decline of the Qing Dynasty, the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire, and the civil war between Nationalists and Communists in Mainland China. In this era of structural changes Jilong became the largest port on the island and a frontier area where Taiwanese, Japanese, and Chinese congregated and interacted as they built a colonial and post-colonial society. Multiple identities were in formation in this period, including a local Jilong identity that both Japanese and Taiwan's islanders constructed as a shared conceptual space. For a time it enabled cooperation between these two groups, particularly their elite members, as together they built the city. At the same time, the islanders who descended from settlers from the Chinese Mainland constructed a new ethnic identity for themselves in contradistinction to the attempted imposition of an increasingly intolerant Japanese national identity. In so doing they relied upon religious traditions, a range of private and semi-private social organizations, and developed patterns of social welfare and social work. As they transformed themselves into a Taiwanese ethnic group, they built and maintained rigid conceptual borders between their group identity and resisted the Japanese officials and settlers who sought to assimilate them to Japanese social and cultural norms. In the post-colonial period, Taiwanese repelled the efforts by the Nationalist Chinese to impose their own national identity on the island and its residents, and so remained ethnically Taiwanese. The central arguments of this dissertation are that identities and ethnicity are constructed from within and without. identities and borders are defined through the interactions of individuals and groups. actions are representative of identities. and ethnicity is a viable social category in its own right. In this last regard, I argue that the experience of Taiwanese ethnic formation provides an important counter-example to the dominant trend of nation-state formation in the 20th century.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Border, China, Ethnicity, Japan, Taiwanese",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

Through in-depth studies on five chronological works directly or indirectly related to Sima Guang's influential Comprehensive Mirror to Aid for the Government, the dissertation argues that the narrative structures of these chronological works were designed to analyze and explain history in specific ways. These works were not simply collections of historical data, but historical models (or paradigm candidates) that provided specific world views and competed others to dominate the field of the study of history. They demonstrate the diversity and vitality of the study of history in the Southern Song, and, when put in chronological order, signified the aforementioned paradigm change in the study of history, which transferred the authority over leadership from the government to the morally cultivated literati, and thus went together with the localist turn transformation in Chinese history.

305337025,"Muscolino, Micah Samuel","Fishing for profits: Environment and society off the China coast, 1840–1958",Contemporary,"This dissertation analyzes processes of environmental change in the fisheries of China's Zhoushan Archipelago, from the 1840s to the late 1950s. This local history relates to the larger issues of economic development, foreign influence, and state making in modern China, while calling attention to their environmental implications. By focusing on the marine ecosystem, moreover, this study illuminates international ecological processes that transcend the borders of the nation-state. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, demographic expansion and commercial integration heightened demands on Zhoushan's marine resources. Responding to these changes, fishers who migrated to Zhoushan from certain regions of Zhejiang and Fujian established unofficial territorial claims to fishing grounds and formulated rules coordinating their use. These institutions enabled regional groups to minimize the loss of profits to unrestrained competition for fishery resources, but did not limit economic pressures to intensify exploitation. Rather, social institutions enabled the commercial networks that transformed fish into commodities to function effectively. In the international context, Japan's mechanized fishing fleet began to fish waters off of Zhoushan in the 1920s after exhausting other fishing grounds in the East China Sea. Domestic and international pressures combined to weaken arrangements coordinating the use of Zhoushan's fisheries, leading to contests for the control of a declining body of resources. From the early twentieth century into the late 1950s, Chinese fishery experts who staffed state management agencies held that science and technology could manipulate finite resources for maximum production and fiscal income, while also preventing depletion. This assumption reflected a project of modernity pursued in China as well as in countries throughout the twentieth-century world. In Zhoushan's fisheries, plans to rationalize exploitation of resources accompanied initiatives to strengthen bureaucratic control and facilitate extraction of revenues. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Chinese state's effort to regulate and tax Zhoushan's fisheries through multiple, competing administrative agencies led to intense inter-bureaucratic conflict. When finally put into practice in the 1950s, fishery development plans maximized short-term economic production and fiscal returns but sacrificed long-term environmental sustainability, contributing to the collapse of Zhoushan's prime fish species.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, China, Coast, Economic development, Fishing, Social conditions, Society",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

At stake was the young empire's claim to have entered the club of modern, civilized nations capable of colonial administration. The Japanese government's narrative of 'success' in Taiwan hinged on its efforts to battle epidemics and improve health. After Japans departure from Taiwan following World War II, the resurgence of contagious diseases long held in check under the Japanese caused popular discontent and forced the Chinese Nationalist regime to implement its own campaigns to prevent disease and improve sanitary standards. This dissertation examines a series of public health campaigns across this period (1895-1949) in order to understand the social history of modern Taiwan from the time of its colonization by Japan in 1895 through the establishment of Chinese Nationalist (KMT) rule in the aftermath of World War II. These campaigns deeply affected the everyday lives of ordinary people and the spaces where they lived. The campaigns did so through a unique infrastructure designed for 'policing health'. This infrastructure gave police broad duties in sanitation and public health and demanded compliance by local self-policing bodies. Policing health allowed the government to penetrate local society, install surveillance mechanisms, and mobilize broad participation in public health campaigns. This study is grounded in the spaces where each campaign most affected daily life: homes, markets and ports, and urban exhibition halls. These campaigns brought the Japanese colonial state and the Chinese Nationalist state into the lives of a large section of the population of Taiwan, and they serve as an excellent site for understanding social and cultural change. This study contributes a new analytical framework for the comparative social history of disease and empire by situating the global circulation of public health and policing infrastructures in the context of local spaces they penetrated. More generally, it treats the history of public health as a valuable opportunity to understand the intersections of knowledge, power, and everyday life.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, China, Colonialism, Health, Japan, Taiwan",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304846369,"Chen, Wenyi","Networks, communities, and identities: On the discursive practices of Yuan literati",Medieval,"This thesis examines two discourses prevalent among literati in the Yuan dynasty: local tradition and dynastic tradition. Rather than focusing on the traditions themselves, it discusses the way Yuan literati employed these two concepts as frameworks of perception in their mutual definition and identity formation. This thesis thus investigates historical developments in the Yuan from the unique perspective of literati communication, demonstrating how Yuan literati, aside from being a social stratum, were organizing and integrating themselves into a cultural community. Chapter one is a case study of the construction and employment of local traditions in Yuan dynasty Wuzhou prefecture. Identifying this phenomenon as a mode of discourse with standardized formal and functional attributes, this chapter traces the cultural forms it adopted and explains the cultural significance of the local to Yuan dynasty intellectuals. Chapter two shows that local tradition was a southern mode of discourse, and that the core concern of local traditions in the north was in fact the national civil order of the Yuan dynasty. This distinction thus brings cultural discrepancies between south and north to our attention. Chapter three explores the dominant discourse found in the north, the dynastic tradition, and its subsequent prevalence in the south. It reveals the ways in which Yuan literati constructed their dynastic identity, the changing orientation of Yuan literati from politics to culture, and the political background to both discourses. Chapter four analyzes the genre of the preface ( xu ) as a social practice, the medium through which local and dynastic discourses were able to gain wide circulation. The preface embodies a structure of social interaction, the means by which literati established social networks and cultural bonds, and as a result the preface was a significant factor in the formation of the literati community. The conclusion describes how the discourses of dynastic and local traditions, as important modes of literati communication, constituted actual and imagined social and cultural structural networks among literati, and how these two modes represent the cultural response of Yuan literati to their historical circumstances.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, China, Communities, Discursive practices, Identities, Literati, Networks, Yuan dynasty",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304530733,"Meyer, Andrew Seth",The Correct Meaning of the Five Classics and the intellectual foundations of the Tang,Medieval,"The Correct Meaning of the Five Classics was a series of subcommentaries to the Confucian classics ordered by the Tang Emperor Taizong (r. 626–649 C.E.) in 635 C.E. Here the Correct Meaning of the Five Classic s shall be studied as a gauge of changing attitudes and values at the time of its production. It shall be argued that these changes in intellectual culture were instrumental in shaping the unique political and social conditions of the Tang empire. The Tang was preceded by a four-century long Period of Division (22–581 C.E.) The ruling aristocracy of this era were radically demoralized and suspicious of central authority, imperial governments were weak and short-lived. This situation began to change in the late sixth century C.E., as did the tenor of Chinese intellectual culture. Leading thinkers emerged who reasserted the value of the Confucian classics and the possibility that they could be used to effect a harmonious and moral society. This trend reached full maturity during the Tang. Among the voluminous writings of Tang official scholarship, there is no better place to focus a search for the prevailing values and attitudes of the day than the Correct Meaning of the Five Classics . In reading the Correct Meaning , we see the founders of the Tang dynasty grappling with the issues that had daunted the intellectuals of the Period of Division.

305008159,"Han, Seunghyun","Re -inventing local tradition: Politics, culture, and identity in early 19th century Suzhou",Contemporary,"The devolution of power to local elites in the nineteenth century China is commonly traced to the period of the Taiping Rebellion in the mid-nineteenth century. My dissertation reveals, however, that the transition from the Qianlong to the Jiaqing reign brought about an intensification of local elite participation in local public affairs and a strong assertion of local identity which was a cultural representation of such an elite social activism. I explore the transformation that the Chinese state went through socially and culturally from the 18 th to the early 19 th century, when China was experiencing dramatic population increase, without a proportionate expansion of the state apparatus, and serious deficit in the state revenue system. I concentrate on the case study of Suzhou, a southern city known for its strong elite power and sense of identity. In the first chapter, I trace the diminishing roles of the state and the intensified southern elite participation in the early 19 th century in various public activities such as water conservancy, bridge building, benevolent societies, and helping poor village and lineage members. In the chapter that follows, I analyze the state endorsement of local worthies and show that more southern worthies were authorized by the state to be worshipped in the local shrines in the early 19 th century than in the 18 th , when the state tried to balance the number of worthies in the north and south. In this process, return of the ritual practice of exhibiting portraits of worthies, which had been prohibited during the 18 th , illustrates the relaxed grasp of the state on local culture in the early 19 th century. In the third chapter, I emphasize the renewed assertion of local identity in the early 19 th century Suzhou as shown in increased numbers of various local histories. While the 18 th century state curtailed the writing of histories by private individuals, and criticized private local histories for their parochialism and pettiness, early 19 th century Suzhou saw the efflorescence of these private local histories that strongly reasserted local identity on various levels. In the last chapter, I turn to discourse analysis centering on a local hero of Suzhou, Zhang Shicheng. Zhang, though received favorably by Suzhou people, was vilified in the subsequent official histories. It was only in the early 19 th century that Suzhou scholars embarked on a project to rehabilitate him and restore him to an honorable position in history.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, China, Culture, Elite activism, Identity, Local tradition, Nineteenth century, Politics, Suzhou",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305192276,"Ong, Chang Woei",Men of letters within the passes: Guanzhong literati from the tenth to eighteenth centuries,Modern,"This dissertation traces chronologically the changes in the historical experiences of the Guanzhong literati from the tenth to the eighteenth centuries. In particular, the discussion is centered on how the literati's perception of the relationships between national and local identities, “official” and “unofficial” realms, and central and regional government changed over time. The long time-span is further divided into three periods, namely, the Five Dynasties–Northern Song, the Jin-Yuan–early Ming, and the mid Ming–high Qing. In the first period, Guanzhong literati experienced “a new beginning” when admission to this privileged class was now determined not by pedigree as it was before but by ones learning and education. Also, what many historians would call “local elite” had assumed central role on the historical stage by this time. This phenomenon would remain so until the eighteenth century. Yet, the literati's view on the abovementioned relationships changed from period to period. In the first period, there were signs showing that some form of local consciousness was beginning to take shape. Also, Guanzhong literati called for a recognition of an extra-bureaucratic space where “unofficial” elite could assume the leadership role in the local community. They generally assumed that the local society could be most effectively governed under the collaboration of the state and the “unofficial” elite. Moreover, while Guanzhong literati generally thought that the regional government should be given enough liberty to carry out their regular duties without the direct command from the central government, they still saw the court as the ultimate political authority. In the second period, Guanzhong literati became nationally and “officially” orientated as well as court-centered. Guanzhong as a locale was irrelevant to their self-definition and many saw being incorporated into the bureaucracy as the ultimate goal. Also, they believed that the state should remain an undifferentiated whole and the court was where the transformation of the world should begin. In the third period, both local consciousness and public-spiritedness became strong, and the state, and even the court, was seen as fragmented. As such, many perceived the local officials not only as agents of the state, but also as advocates of local interest.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, China, Eighteenth century, Guanzhong, Identity, Literati, Society, Tenth century",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304850025,"Li, Cho-ying",Evolutionary statecraft: The Ming state and local elites in the field of hydrological management in the Lower Yangtze Delta,Modern,"This research examines the evolution of statecraft in the field of hydrological management by focusing on the roles of the Ming state and local elites in administrative coordination, regulation of funding and corvée, and formulation of hydrological knowledge. The three-phase evolution of hydrological management over the course of the Ming dynasty, which this research adopts, is based on the analysis of local gazetteers, literary works of bureaucrats and local elites, and hydrological specialists' books. A common characteristic in all these phases is the active role of the local elite, particularly in their sophisticated appeals for the state to be more active and proactive in maintaining good hydrological conditions. In the first phase (1360s-1450s), the state was not required to pay the people for their work on hydrological management. It was relatively easy for officials to launch large and routine projects. In the second phase (1460s-1570s), a shared view was that regional-scale hydrological management was necessary to keep the condition in good shape, and that furthermore it required the supervision of a regional hydrological authority. Since paying the public had become a noun, bureaucrats and local elites developed a variety of strategies to stabilize funding. Another important experiment was the head land system and the expansion of mobilization based on landownership to secure labor. The need to achieve effective use of funding and labor led to a critical development: the systematization of hydrological understanding. In the third and final phase (1570s-1640s), localization of hydrological management emerged as an important alternative to the regional-scale hydrological management. Although the regional-scale approach, after one-century experiment, was eventually abandoned, this research shows that the consensus reached among bureaucrats and local elites during the second phase—that is, those who benefited should bear the cost, or the principle of benefit—built a sold foundation for them in this final phase to manage hydrological matters without the intervention of higher authorities.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, China, Elites, Hydrological management, Jaingnan, Local elite, Ming dynasty, Statecraft, Water management, Yangtze Delta",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304890412,"Lee, Sukhee",Negotiated power: The state and elites in 12th -14th century China,Medieval,"My dissertation explores how a new relationship between the state and society was formed in twelfth–fourteenth century China. Taking Mingzhou, modern Ningbo city, Zhejiang Province, as my case study, I challenge the assumption on which many interpretations of this period are based, namely a zero-sum competition between state power and that of local elites. Rather than asking a counter-productive question of “whether the late imperial Chinese state was strong or weak” vis-à-vis local elites, I orient my research toward an analysis of continual negotiation between them and what their voices tell us about the period. I have found that the presence of the state, not its absence, was essential to the rise of local elite society. Chapter One examines who the main actors were in the remarkable growth of Mingzhou during the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279), and what made them different from elites in other localities, chiefly the elites of Fuzhou, Jiangxi, upon whom our understanding of Southern Song social elites has been largely based. Drawing mainly on 140 epitaphs written for Mingzhou natives, I argue that a flourishing elite community in Southern Song Mingzhou was an outcome of the connectedness of its elite to the state, not of their separation from it. In Chapter Two, I argue that the local government in Southern Song showed a notable resiliency and administrative competence. Far from helpless, the local state managed to find a way to continue to be a reliable gatekeeper of society in terms of local defense and infrastructure building. Based on a close reading of the way in which policies of the Mingzhou government were worked out, I also show that the local government was actively negotiating with local people and did not lose its substantial leverage in this process well into the 1250s. Rather than seeing these facts as simple proof of the relative weakening of state power, I interpret them as a sign that the local state began to view itself as a participant in and caretaker of local society, not simply as its ruler. Chapter Three starts with a question: in what fields can we find so-called “elite activism”? From this perspective, building and renovating local schools, reviving an ancient community ritual, creating a self-help institution, and organizing a voluntary association to cope with state imposed duty are all examined. Local community building was not dominated, let alone monopolized, by local elites. The Mingzhou government was enthusiastic about sustaining local community by becoming a financial supporter, administrative manager, and timely reformer of various local projects. The rise of local activism during the Southern Song period, I argue, was undergirded by an activism of local government. In Chapter Four, I turn to what happened to Mingzhou society and its elites during the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). In the absence of the examination system, arguably the most significant institutional link connecting local elites with the state, how did local elites make sense of themselves and the state? How did the seeds of localism planted during Southern Song grow under the alien regime? In answering these questions, I show the crucial importance of the Yuan period in shaping local elite society and handing it over to the late imperial period.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, China, Elites, Local government, Mingzhou, Southern Song, State-society relations, Yuan",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305333506,"Chou, Shang-Tseh",Emperorship redefined: Developments of the state ritual program in seventh-century China,Ancient,"This study searches for a new historical context to re-examine the changes of emperorship in Tang China during the seventh century. The developments of the Tang state ritual program is used as an index to gauge the changing relationships between the emperor, members of the imperial house, and the rest of the ruling elite. I argue that the power structure of the Tang court underwent a significant re-organization since the 650s. The officials withdrew from interfering with the emperor's private and familial domains, and close kin of the emperor replaced high officials as the new co-rulers. The legitimacy of imperial power was less predicated on a commitment to common goals, collective policy-making, and negotiation of power between the emperor and the aristocratic class, which had been characteristic of the period before the 650s. All these changes were registered in the developments of state rituals. My study rediscovers the paradigmatic role of the feng and shan rites performed in 666, which initiated an aggressive series of state ritual reforms. Along with the holy rites of 666, all the new practices in the imperial ancestral rites, the suburban altar sacrifices, and the mingtang ceremonies re-wrote the concepts of emperorship, establishing the emperor as the ultimate source of status and power. They marked an important landmark in the history of imperial China. “ Primus inter pares ” was no longer applicable in understanding emperorship from now to the end of the imperial period.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, China, Emperorship, Rituals, Seventh century, State ritual, Tang dynasty",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

For most of the nineteenth century Gonpo Namgyel dominated politics of Kham and posed a serious challenge to both the Qing and Lhasa regimes. The study to explore the dynamics of local and national politics, as well as the tension over power and authority between the power centers in the mid-nineteenth century. Drawing upon both Tibetan and Chinese primary sources, this study sheds new light not only on the governance and polity of the Kham region, but also on our understanding of Sino-Tibetan conflicts over Kham from the nineteenth century up to the mid-twentieth century. This study focuses on local events, rather than seeing history as shaped solely by the power centers. The rise of Gonpo Namgyel is situated within the context of the local politics of Kham while taking into consideration its relations with mid-nineteenth century Qing and Central Tibetan politics. The study further explores the social-cultural milieu that gave rise to this charismatic and controversial chief. A series of questions emerge concerning traditional historiographical practice, including the historical practices by Chinese and Tibetan scholars as well as approaches to the history of China and Tibet by western scholars. This study demonstrates how a seemingly unimportant event in a remote area had had a significant role in influencing the national history of both China and Tibet. Probing into history from a local perspective adds a new dimension to the study of nineteenth-century Sino-Tibetan relations. This research reveals that there is no single force determining history, nor are persons in the periphery were passive observers of national events.

After showing how this concept has long been a problematic area for Western scholarship and how using this concept may be inappropriate in this case, I present another way to understand the debates over the ancestral temple by using the terms institutional tradition and personal belief. To present the background of the imperial ancestral temple, I consider this institution prior to the Han, both as we currently understand it and as it was understood during the Han. Then the development of the institution during the Western Han shows the ways in which the earlier tradition was the basis for its reinvention in terms of the institutional tradition, and how its proper arrangement was contested at length between the emperor and his ministers. Finally, I demonstrate how the notion of personal belief can be seen in contrast to the institutional tradition and that the interplay between these two aspects of the tradition is critical for its formation.

304099886,"Chien, Cecilia Lee-fang",The government monopoly of salt in the Song dynasty (960-1279): An annotated translation of the monograph on salt in the Shihuozhi of the Songshi with introduction,Medieval,"Salt was a key segment of the Chinese government monopoly system since its inception in the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.). As a daily necessity and a large-scale industry with localized production, it was an ideal target for bureaucratic management. Through the Tang (618-907) and by the Song (960-1279), fiscal needs accelerated and so, too, bureaucratization. The Song's nomadic neighbors posed a constant threat and forced payment of heavy annual tribute. In addition was the cost of maintenance of an army which quintupled in size to over one million men. When not much more could be levied from agricultural taxes to provide for rising internal and external expenditures, the lucrative monopoly of salt was a logical resort. The monograph on salt in the Songshi is a storehouse of information for understanding the salt monopoly. I have translated into English this text written in the bureaucratese of 1,000 years ago and which is full of specialized terms and complicated debates relating to finance, politics, and the salt trade itself. I have also annotated the text using primary sources of the period, including the Song huiyao, Xuzizhi tongjian changbian, Wenxian tongkao, Jianyan yilai chaoye zaji, Jianyan yilai xinian yaolu, and Aobo tu. My annotations corroborate, correct, supplement, and fill in lacunae of topic and time, thus qualitatively and quantitatively making for a comprehensive study. The annotated translation is introduced by an essay on the subject in a broad context. The main types of salt produced in the Song--pond, sea, earth, and well--came to provide as much as one half of the government's revenues. Yet from a modern economic perspective, the records show the salt monopoly at every stage to be seemingly irrational in practice and burdensome to the people. In the context of fiscal imperatives of this pre-modern bureaucratic state, however, salt administrators sought not economic but, rather, fiscal and bureaucratic solutions. The monopoly was above all a fiscal bureaucracy with a goal not of maximal profit but, rather, reliable revenue procurement for the state.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, China, political economy",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304199337,"DeVido, Elise Anne","The making of the Communist party-state in Shandong Province, 1927-1952",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines how the Chinese Communists' linkage of state-making with social revolution led to their accession to national power by focussing on the specific experiences of the Chinese Communist movement in Shandong Province, 1927-1952. The Shandong base area served as a major transportation and communication conduit for the Communists during World War II, then provided essential personnel, materials, and revenue during the great campaigns of the Chinese civil war, 1945-1949. It was thus imperative that the Communists develop a bureaucratic and organizational infrastructure at both the provincial and regional levels. Based on newly-available sources from the Shandong provincial archives and other Communist party history materials, this study argues that centralization and unification of the Communist party-state did not begin in a vacuum from 1949, but had its origins in the necessity to unify and concentrate materials and organizational structures in order to wage war. This dissertation finds that throughout the 1940s and through the first three years of the formal Communist state, the Communists grappled with such statebuilding problems as how to balance power among central, provincial and local authorities, among the party, government, and military organizations, and with tensions between the Communist military and local society. The pragmatic policies the Communists devised in order to solve these problems included development of fiscal and economic administration, systematization of civilian labor service during the civil war, coordinated with rear-area production and front-line support, and management of foreign trade, including the export of opium, despite the Communists' public condemnation of opium production and trade. This study emphasizes that, like today, commerce and trade were vital to the growth of the Shandong Communist movement during the 1940s, not only as part of its wartime economic development platform, but also to finance the Communists' civil and military organizations.

1751288703,"Miller, Ian Matthew","Roots and Branches: Woodland Institutions in South China, 800-1600",Modern,"In this dissertation I trace the evolution of the institutions governing woodland in South China over the longue durée. I claim that after a high point of state forestry the imperial government lost both the interest and the ability to manage woodland effectively. Forestry was largely taken over by lineages - kin groups organized around the worship of shared ancestors. I tie this transition in woodland governance to two interrelated trends: growth in the power and independence of lineage organizations, and of long-distance trade in wood products. First, I show changes in local state capacities for tax collection and dispute resolution, the growing organizational capacity of lineages. Second, I argue that the growth of trade in woodland products affected state and lineage differently. On the one hand, government bureaus had increasing difficulty governing wood&#xa0. land &#xa0.while finding it increasingly convenient to obtain wood products on the market. On the other hand, lineages were well-equipped for the business of managing local landscapes, and saw substantial profits to be made from the export of timber and other forest commodities. Finally, I argue that the rise of lineage influence shaped the terms in which woodland was claimed for private use. Over hundreds of years, claims to woodland shifted from the formal legal discourse specified by the imperial state to focus on the specialized language of fengshui. By the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, claims no longer trumpeted the productive capacity of forests or their role in paying the taxes important to the state. they now focused on the physical and metaphysical powers of the wooded landscape and its role in protecting the graves important to lineages. Contrary to existing scholarship, I claim that the decline of state forestry did not necessarily lead to the decline of the woods themselves. lineage oversight was highly effective at managing forests for both production and protection, and areas of strong lineage control remained well-forested into the modern era.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"History, China, Woodland",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305008238,"Liu, William G.","Wrestling for power: The state and economy in later imperial China, 1000–1770",Medieval,"This thesis aims to compare later imperial China's market economy and state finance in two transitional periods: the Tang-Song transition (starting from the eighth century to the twelfth century, and the Ming-Qing transition (starting from the sixteenth century to the eighteenth century). My study suggests a divergence of the market economy between the Song and post-Song times. The size of the Song market economy in the twelfth century was only exceeded by the Qing economy in the 1770s, while in terms of real income per capita the Song lead remained even thereafter. This comparison also indicates that the early Ming period (1368-1450) was a turning point that caused this Song-Ming divergence: prices dropped to a level as low as that of the seventh-century China. meanwhile real wages declined dramatically even when the aggregate population decreased by one-third in the late fourteenth century. My study also demonstrates divergent paths in later imperial China's state building. First, the Song state can be termed the fiscal state , as its statehood was largely ensured by administration through market means. Secondly, the early Ming regime demonstrated another kind of powerful state administration, which I define as the despotic state , by exerting direct control over populace and resources.

This thesis analyzes the transformation of the regional economy of the lower Yangzi delta to explore the close interrelationship between the international and domestic dimensions of the Chinese economy. This study focuses on three areas. The first is the mechanism of China's silver-standard monetary system. The Shanghai financial market was closely integrated with the international silver market. In the first two years of the depression, 1929 to 1931, China avoided worst effects because of the international depreciation of silver. This inflationary trend reversed, however, when foreign countries devalued their currencies after 1931. The American Silver Purchase Act in 1934 further raised the international price of silver. Since the price of silver in China lagged behind the sudden rise in the international price, large amounts of silver flowed out of China. The second focus is the impact of fluctuations in the price of silver on the Chinese economy. The credit expansion was based on silver and its outflow was deflationary. The regional economy of the lower Yangzi delta revealed itself most vulnerable to deflationary pressure. Once commodity prices and value of assets declined, credit-loan relationships which among industrial enterprises, rural households, and urban and rural financial institutions, developed during the years of inflation, ceased to work. The third focus is effects of the crisis on the relationship between the state and society. Searching ways to recover from the depression, the government increased its influence in the economy, especially in the banking system and in the agricultural promotion. Most important, by moving to the foreign-exchange standard in November 1935, the government succeeded in eliminating the negative effects of the rising price of silver. Nonetheless, the government's control was far from total. Although the Nanjing GMD government lasted from 1927 to 1937, its role in the economy changed significantly during the depression years. The intensified tension between the government and the people over currency convertibility in particular, has important implications for the nature of the state-society relationship.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, China, Great Depression, Regional economy, Yangzi delta",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304528843,"Xiao, Yanming","State and industrial development in early Republican China, 1912-1927",Contemporary,"This dissertation is about industrial development in early Republican China (1912–27). It attempts to answer two basic questions. First, was there sustained industrial development at the time? Second, if yes, how do we explain the development? Regarding the first question, the study goes beyond mere qualitative descriptions by employing extensive quantitative data at both country and sectoral levels. It finds that industrial development was indeed rapid for the period under study. Specifically, signs of initial development had already begun prior to the Republican era, coinciding with the intensive reform efforts, known as Xinzheng , or “new policy” reforms in the late Qing years. Further, industrial development was not only rapid in the 1910s, but also into the 1920s, even though much of the 1920s witnessed the political disintegration of China as regional military powers withheld their political allegiance to the center, a period known as warlordism (1916–27). Regarding the second question, the conventional wisdom points to the impact of the WWI (1914–18). This study, however, argues that statist efforts by both Xinzheng reformers and early Republican governments to foster a pro-industrial institutional environment were a critical factor. In advancing the argument, the study presents evidence that while the WWI may have facilitated growth of some industrial sectors in China. it hindered others, because imports of some critical capital goods were delayed during the war. In any case, whatever the impact the war may have, it was limited in depth and duration if only because industrial development in China had already begun prior to and continued after the war. Finally, to answer why development was possible during warlordism, the dissertation. engages in three sub-national case studies, that of Shanxi, Tianjin and Shanghai. It shows that while regional warlords may have withheld political allegiance from the center, they nonetheless saw eye-to-eye with the center insofar as nurturing a pro-industrial institutional environment is concerned, even though this time their ultimate intention was perhaps to enrich their own local coffers, or even their own pockets. In short, robust sub-national governments played a critical role in the industrial development in China at the time.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, History, China, Industrial development, Republican, State",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

It advances the premise that coal and later oil enabled not only the transformation of human society’s material foundations, but also allowed for new kinds of publics and politics. This dissertation is grounded in Fushun, the “Coal Capital” of Manchuria that once boasted East Asia's largest coal mining operations. Through the history of the Fushun Colliery, it examines how various Chinese and Japanese states and their subsidiaries, which had at different times extended control over this site, were participant in the co-production of calorific and political power. A key contention is that for all their ideological and institutional divergences, the Japanese imperial, Chinese Nationalist, and Chinese Communist regimes shared a markedly technocratic bent that was reflected and reproduced in their management of the coal mining industry. The materiality of coal features prominently in this inquiry. The study traces the ways in which this resource was mined, transported, and burned. At the same time, it is attentive to more discursive inflections, from the meanings and importance ascribed to energy as a factor of production and a necessity for modern life to shared ideals of securing access to cheap and endless supplies of carbon. To numerous Chinese and Japanese businessmen, engineers, scientists, military officials, politicians, and technocrats, Manchuria promised a solution to the energy crises of their times, and there they experimented with new extractive technologies of scale and scope, most notably open-pit mining. At the broadest level, this narrative, which draws from a range of Chinese, Japanese, and English sources, is a retelling of East Asia's recent past from the standpoint of energy. In so doing, it seeks not only to provide a mostly unexplored East Asian perspective to the history of energy—a field that has been largely defined by the research of scholars of North America and Europe—but also to show how considerations of carbon are central to writing histories of modernity in general.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"History, Economic history, Science history, China, Coal mining, Energy, Industrial modernity, Japan, Technocracy",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
1170962024,"Schlesinger, Jonathan","The Qing Invention of Nature: Environment and Identity in Northeast China and Mongolia, 1750-1850",Modern,"This dissertation studies the nexus of empire, environment, and market that defined Qing China in 1750–1850, when unprecedented commercial expansion and a rush for natural resources—including furs, pharmaceuticals, and precious minerals—transformed the ecology of China and its borderlands. That boom, no less than today's, had profound institutional, ideological, and environmental causes and consequences. Nature itself was redefined. In this thesis, I show that it was the activism, not the atavism, of early modern empire that produced nature. Wilderness as such was not a state of nature: it reflected the nature of the state. Imperial efforts to elaborate and preserve pure ethnic homelands during the boom were at the center of this process. Using archival materials from Northeast China and Mongolia as case studies, the dissertation reassesses the view that homesteaders transformed China's frontiers from wilderness to breadbasket after 1850. I argue instead that, like the Russian East and American West, the Qing empire's North was never a primitive wilderness—it only seemed so to late 19th century observers. Manchuria and Mongolia, in fact, had served local and global markets. The boom years of the 1700s in particular witnessed a surge in poaching, commercial licensing, and violent purification campaigns to restore the environment, stem migration, and promote traditional land-use patterns. Results were mixed. conservation succeeded in some territories, while others suffered dramatic environmental change: emptied of fur-bearing animals, stripped of wild pharmaceuticals, left bare around abandoned worker camps.

Customs records from the United States, South Africa, Mauritius, India and Indonesia are used to make a fuller tabulation of U.S.-East Indian trade than has been heretofore possible. These records are supplemented with business paper of U.S. merchants where appropriate. It is argued that though U.S foreign trade at this period did not create significant growth in the U.S. economy, U.S. trade to Asia did help create a new American class of investor-capitalists, the first generation of American millionaires. These business leaders then brought their experience and capital to other businesses, significantly affecting the shape of the U.S. economy after 1815. It is also argued that the success of U.S. free trade to Asia in general and to India in particular was a prime factor in Parliament's decision to permit a free, British trade to India (as opposed to the East India Company's monopolied trade) to compete better with the American commercial presence there.

In the early nineteenth-century, Germans were on the margins of both the Chinese and British Empires, connecting former frontier regions to the major hubs of Asian trade. Over the nineteenth-century there was a large expansion of trade on the coast, where Qing authority had to contend with an emerging international maritime legal and economic order, and German shippers before national unification had a niche as carriers of domestic Chinese trade. As transport technology changed, western shipping interests clamored for the Chinese state to undertake material changes on China's waterways to develop new port infrastructure. Galvanized by a series of natural disasters as well as a dramatic increase in trade, Chinese officials began to collaborate with Western officials and engineers to manage infrastructure projects. Germans in particular played a key role in the transnational transfer of technology. All the while, late Qing and Republican Chinese governments gained increasing control over the internationally-staffed water conservancy organizations. With the First World War, Europeans, preoccupied with their own conflict, shifted their attention away from China, and Americans took up where the Europeans had left off in the financing and advising of hydraulic projects.

It is the first study of its type to take mass-produced printed maps in published books as its central focus, rather than court-centered cartography or other manuscript maps. The dissertation argues that the transformations that took place during the publishing boom were primarily in the deployment of maps rather than in their technical qualities. It examines a series of path-breaking works in genres including geographical education, military affairs, and history to outline the ways in which maps achieved unprecedented penetration among published materials, even in the absence of the transformative theoretical and technological changes adopted by contemporary cartographers in parts of Europe. By examining contemporaneous developments in neighboring Chosoˇn Korea and Japan, the dissertation demonstrates that it is profitable to consider the entire East Asian sphere in the early modern period, rather than focusing on countries as discreet units with individual cartographic histories. The dissertation also reexamines the place of Jesuit cartographic materials across these same political and cultural boundaries.

1503858655,"Oidtmann, Max Gordon","Between patron and priest: Amdo tibet under qing rule, 1792-1911",Contemporary,"In the late eighteenth century, a Qing-centered, pluralistic legal order emerged in the Tibetan regions of the Qing empire. In the Gansu borderlands known to Tibetans as Amdo, the Qing state established subprefectures to administer indigenous populations and prepare them for integration into the empire. In the 1790s, the Qianlong emperor asserted the dynasty's sovereignty in central Tibet and embarked on a program to reform the Tibetan government. This dissertation examines the nineteenth-century legacy of these policies from the twin perspectives of the indigenous people of the region and the officials dispatched to manage them. On the basis of Manchu and Tibetan-language sources, Part One argues that the exercise of Qing sovereignty in central Tibet was connected to the Qianlong court's desire to monopolize indigenous arts of divination, especially as they related to the identification of prominent reincarnations. The Qing court exported a Ming-era bureaucratic technology--a lottery, and repurposed it as a divination technology--the Golden Urn. The successful implementation of this new ritual, however, hinged on the astute use of legal cases and the intervention of Tibetan Buddhist elites, who found a home for the Urn within indigenous traditions. Several Tibetans involved in the initial implementation of the Urn hailed from Amdo, and their knowledge of the Qing empire and Tibetan legal culture informs Part Two. Following Qing official critiques of Buddhist governance, these Tibetans reasserted the legitimacy of Buddhist jurisprudence and celebrated the rise of large monastic polities in Amdo. However, on the basis of the extant archives of a Qing subprefect in Amdo, I argue that Tibetan litigants also made extensive use of Qing institutions to resolve conflicts and the contingent adjudication of legal cases in Qing forums fundamentally shaped the growth of large monastic domains such as Labrang Monastery. Qing local officials served as the embodiment of a pluralistic legal order and the insistence that Qing officials exercise Tibetan jurisprudence resulted in the creation of a distinctive body of legal practices. The encounter between Qing officials and Tibetans in the course of legal proceedings, therefore, played an essential role in consolidating a fractious Tibetan world.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"History, History, Amdo, China, Legal pluralism, Qing empire, Tibet, Tibetan buddhism",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

The colonial state pursued two major goals in Taiwan: economic development through rice agriculture and sugar manufacturing and the creation of a subimperial sphere of influence in South China and Southeast Asia, the so-called nanpo. The TDC, a semi-public national policy corporation, was instrumental in implementing both. It integrated development and expansion into a form of developmental imperialism distinct from the military expansion in Northeast Asia that defines Japanese imperialism in existing historiography. The company engaged in a broad range of businesses in Taiwan and abroad. On Taiwan, it initially concentrated on land development and agriculture. In the late 1930s, however, it shifted to chemicals, metals, and mining. This was part of a larger effort to change the role of the Taiwanese economy within the empire from a periphery supplying raw materials to the Japanese metropole into a separate industrial core processing raw materials from its own periphery in the nanpo. Overseas, the company focused on French Indochina, where it mined and exported ore for processing in Taiwan and Japan, and Hainan Island, where it tried to create a second Taiwan by applying the development experience of Japan's first island colony. In both sites, the TDC, backed by the colonial state, sought a dominant position in competition with other public and private Japanese interests. TDC programs overseas attempted to link industrialization in Justin Adam Schneider Taiwan with an exclusive subimperial sphere in the nanpo. While absorption into the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere and Japanese defeat prevented this, the TDC's history demonstrates that Taiwan was as much an imperial as a colonial project, that Taihoku was as important as Tokyo in the early southward advance, and that competition among Japanese interests, as well as between Japanese and Taiwanese, was crucial in shaping the course of Japanese imperialism. The firm's legacy also contributed to postwar Taiwanese development, through both the physical capital of its plants, one of which is still in operation, and the human capital of its former employees, some of whom founded their own firms.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, History, China",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304846488,"O'Dwyer, Emer Sinead",People's empire: Democratic imperialism in Japanese Manchuria,Contemporary,"This dissertation introduces the idea of democratic imperialism to describe citizen involvement in Japan's colonial governance of northeast China during the first half of the twentieth century. It examines the imbrication of democracy and empire that lies at the heart of Japan's modern transformation and which has so far been neglected by historians of the nation's colonial expansion. Part one examines the emergence of democratic imperialism as a movement in the early Taishō years, focusing on its embrace of nationalism, imperialism, and populism in the name of the emperor. Citizen calls for a share in the job of empire developed in tandem with the metropolitan government's increasingly muscular foreign policy vis-à-vis China in the mid-'teens, and growing inter-imperial rivalries between Korea and Manchuria, the contemporary term for China's three northeastern provinces. The transformation of democratic imperialism from a movement controlled by Japanese plutocrats into a more broad-based movement, in terms of class and gender, is explored in the dissertation's second part. Mantetsu democracy emerged as the most potent expression of this transformation as employees of the South Manchuria Railway Company (Mantetsu) established an association in 1926 aimed at nurturing employees' self-identification as self-governing sub-imperialists. The twin project of improving working conditions caused fissures within the group as members grappled with the conundrum of pressing (Japanese) labor demands in a colonial setting. The Kwantung Army's takeover of the northeast and establishment of Manchukuo in 1932 set the stage for the dissertation's third and final part. A willingness to accommodate aggressive imperialism undergirded the movement for democratic imperialism from its earliest days. However, as the Kwantung Army extended its reach beyond military affairs into economic, social, and political realms in the mid-1930s, democratic imperialism came face to face with the contradictions and fundamental weaknesses upon which it had been built. The periodicals and newspapers published by Japanese residents of prewar Manchuria form the core of the dissertation's source base and are supplemented by the use of diaries, memoirs, and oral histories.

This dissertation aims both to reconstruct a satisfactory narrative history of the movement and to explain its development. The main body of the dissertation is divided into five chapters. Chapter one provides readers with the historical background of the submission of Mongolia to the Manchus, Manchu policy toward Mongolia, and Mongolian society during the Ch'ing period. Chapter two describes the change of Manchu policy in Mongolia, the initiation of the independence movement, and the historical context of the movement. Chapter three deals with the Mongolian military campaign in Uliyasutai and Khobdo, and Outer Mongolia's relations with Russia and China before the conclusion of the Sino-Russian declaration in November 1913. Chapter four, which describes Urga's military campaign in Inner Mongolia in 1913 and the response of Barga and Tangnu Uriyangkhai to the movement, demonstrates that the Mongolian independence movement was a Pan-Mongolian endeavor. Chapter five examines the tripartite conference of Kyakhta in 1915, the Inner Mongols' attitude toward the independence movement, and the resistance of Babuujab, who refused to accept the relinquishment of Mongolian independence. The conclusion examines the development of the movement in general. It is argued that the Mongolian independence movement of 1911 had laid the foundation of the Mongols' later success in establishing an internationally recognized independent country, and that the movement also served as a powerful educational means leading to a subsequent rise of Mongolian nationalism.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, History, China, Manchus, Russia",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304087279,"Matsusaka, Yoshihisa Tak","Japanese imperialism and the South Manchuria Railway Company, 1904-1914",Contemporary,"This study explores the empire-building strategies employed by the Japanese in the early stages of their expansionist venture in Northeast China between 1904 and 1914. In order to compensate for Japan's relative weakness as an aspiring imperialist power, policy makers devised a number innovative military and economic schemes that would make optimum use of the nation's limited resources. Central to these plans was the three-fold use of the railroad as a covert military installation, as an instrument of territorial control, and as a source of revenue to finance the venture as a whole. A quasi-official corporation known as the South Manchuria Railway Company was established in 1906 to manage this program. Also crucial were a series of fundamental reforms in military policy which redefined the principal mission of the nation's ground forces as the defense of Japan's position in Northeast China against Russia. The Imperial Defense Plan of 1907 codified this mission, in effect transforming the Japanese army into an instrument of Manchuria policy. These strategies proved to be highly effective during the first few years of the venture. Overcoming its initial disabilities, Japan emerged as the most successful among the imperialist powers in carving out a coherent sphere of influence in China. In time, however, what had started out as creative adaptations to the conditions prevailing in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War devolved into fixed policy prescriptions increasingly irrelevant to the actual opportunities and needs confronting Japanese imperialism. Strategies in Manchuria remained unchanged despite the fact that military and geopolitical developments unfolding between 1910 and 1914 had rendered them largely obsolete. The study explains this pattern of policy evolution as the result of a gradual displacement of the original goals of expansion by the organizational interests of the agencies charged with implementation. The defense of Manchuria justified the institutional claims of the army to power, prestige and a major share of the nation's resources. The use of the railroad as an instrument of empire likewise provided the South Manchuria Railway Company with its reason for being. Both agencies vigorously resisted any adjustments in imperial policy that threatened these claims and sought to enforce the government's continued commitment to the program formulated in 1905.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, History, China, Russia",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

The study consists of four related case studies on major late Qing and early Japanese policy debates on Taiwan between 1874 and 1906, namely, the Sino-Japanese controversy on aboriginal Taiwan in 1874, the Qing policy debate on the building of Taiwan province in the 1880s, the Sino-Japanese negotiation of Taiwan cession in 1895, and Meiji policy debates on the governance of Taiwan colony in late 1890s. The discussion focuses on multiple and competing visions of Qing and Japanese officials on Taiwan's status and territorial rule. The study shows important continuities and contingencies in Taiwan's territorial transition between Qing and Japanese empires. The study of Qing and Japanese frontier state building in nineteenth-century Taiwan provides a case of comparative colonialism, nationalism, and colonial modernity in modern East Asia. The dissertation consists of six chapters: Chapter 1 reviews the historiographies of Chinese frontier history and Japanese colonial studies and introduces the subject of Taiwan's transition and the issues of sovereignty and territory in nineteenth century East Asia. Chapter 2 retells the 1874 Sino-Japanese controversy over aboriginal Taiwan as an historical event that introduced modern notion of territorial sovereignty to Taiwan. Chapter 3 examines late-Qing debates on Taiwan province between 1875 and 1885 and competing visions of territorial rule and attempts to consolidate Chinese sovereignty of the island. Chapter 4 interprets the episode of the 1895 Taiwan republic as local resistance to the cession crisis that affected the nature of Japanese takeover from peaceful transition to military conquest. Chapter 5 discusses Japanese debates on Taiwan's status within the Meiji empire from 1895–1905 that was characterized by constitutional and political controversy over colonial legislation and administration.

304530766,"Xu, Guoqi",The age of innocence: The First World War and China's quest for national identity,Contemporary,"This dissertation is the first full-length study of China and the First World War, a subject which has not been adequately studied until now. No book in any language deals with the subject from the broader perspective of international history. No existing scholarship communicates a sense of China's strong desire to join the international system and to help bring about a new world order through its interaction with the European War. This study addresses these historiographical gaps by examining how the coming of the First World War affected China's approach to world affairs, how China identified itself in the international arena, how it perceived the international system, and how the great powers accommodated China's ambitions. Based on previously unexamined primary sources from archives in mainland China, Taiwan, Britain, France, Germany and the United States, this study analyzes how China used the occasion of the First World War to try to join the international system. My research reveals that the war not only provided an opportunity for the Chinese to explore a new national identity, but more importantly, gave momentum to China's search for a new niche in the international family. The importance of the era is also reflected in the unique combination of political nationalism, cultural iconoclasm and diplomatic internationalism found in China's approach to international affairs. More importantly, public opinion during the period under consideration played an important role in defining China's destiny, in particular, with respect to foreign policy and national identity. By providing a detailed examination of China's response to the Great War and by exploring the causes of Chinese idealism or romanticism, this dissertation further reveals that the era of the First World War was an age of innocence for China. This innocence explains why China experienced so many twists and turns in its relations with the world during the war and the remainder of the century. By using an international history approach, this dissertation suggests a new direction to take in explaining the interaction between China and the war. Unlike traditional diplomatic history, international history goes beyond the national level of analysis and treats the entire world as a framework of study. Furthermore, international relations are seen as interactions among cultural systems. Using this approach, my study explores the relationship between an international power system and cultural outlook, between nationalism and internationalism, between national dreams and collective disappointments, and emphasizes communication within and among nations. Such an international history approach allows me to base my analysis of China's response to the First World War on examining the neglected intellectual foundations of Chinese diplomacy. It also enables me to understand how China was affected by the world order as a whole, and at the same time contributed to defining it. in addition, such an approach reveals how Chinese domestic politics and international affairs were interconnected.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, China, International relations, National identity, World War I",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
815849737,"Easley, Leif-Eric","Perceived national identity differences and strategic trust explaining post-Cold War security relations among China, Japan, South Korea and the United States",Contemporary,"How do military allies find each other more dependable on security issues, instead of becoming less comfortable relying on each other? How do potential rival states manage to build confidence and shared expectations for a collaborative future, rather than face growing suspicion over each other's strategic intentions? Two sets of allies (U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea) and two sets of potential rivals (U.S.-China and China-Japan) exhibited very different trends in strategic trust in post-Cold War East Asia. These trends defy existing explanations based on power balance, economic interdependence and regime type. This dissertation develops a theory that uses perceptions of national identity to explain variation in trust between governments on matters of national security. The greater difference foreign policymakers perceive between their countries' national identities, the less strategic trust their two governments are expected to share. On the other hand, the less perceived identity difference, the more nation-states are predicted to demonstrate the mutual trust that facilitates security cooperation. The dissertation shows how perceived identity difference accounts for change in strategic trust by applying the theory to newly collected data from government documents, primary and secondary materials in Japanese, Chinese, Korean and English, and author interviews with high-level policymakers and analysts from all four countries. The project provides in-depth examination of how policymakers look inside each other's countries in an effort to divine geopolitical intentions. The causal story about cycles of perceived identity difference, strategic trust and security cooperation focuses on the nationalist devaluation of other countries that effectively drives spirals in trust and a less stable international environment. Furthermore, nation-states with decreasing trust often coordinate less than overlapping interests and efficient application of resources would suggest. Hence, identity perceptions help explain the absence of cooperation one might expect to see. By developing and applying the theory of perceived identity difference and strategic trust, the dissertation shows how the interaction of competing nationalisms shaped East Asia's security relations after the Cold War.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, International Relations, Political science, Asia, China, Foreign policy, Historical memory, Japan, Military relations, Nationalism, Security, South Korea, United States",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

My focus is law and the news media, particularly the role of social networks in creating a realm of autonomy from the central government in the context of the rise of strong party-states in twentieth-century China. Rather than simply gauge the relations between the state and these intellectuals, I analyze actual interactions between them, as each sought to influence judicial decision-making and the construction of favorable public opinion through the news media. The influence of the news media on judicial decision-making in the most famous political trials of the Republican era, such as the New Life Weekly Case of 1935 and the Seven Gentlemen Case of 1937, constitute the crucial subject of this project. In these cases, China's Nationalist state attempted to silence non-official local elites who became notorious critics of its policies, and particularly its policy of perceived 'appeasement' toward Japan. Yet in the Nationalist period there was no clear winner. Constrained as it may have been by government censorship, media coverage of the trials provided dissident social elites with a public forum to successfully contest the government's accusations outside the courtroom in the 1930s. Comparison between the New Life Weekly and Seven Gentlemen cases demonstrates that broad horizontal social networks among urban intellectuals were effective in winning cooperation and influencing public opinion and publicity appearing in the mainstream news media. Government officials, defendants, and the news media forged social networks in the process of state building and commercialization, enabling them to cut across the boundary between the state and society and to cooperate in the construction of public opinion. However, in order to challenge state power, urban intellectuals benefited much more from accumulating broad horizontal networks with other intellectuals than possessing narrow hierarchical social networks with government officials. In contrast to the Nationalist government, since its foundation in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) government had been a steady winner in the tug-of-war over political representation. By 1957, urban intellectuals could no longer effectively contest government accusations and became extremely vulnerable to the state's political purges. I argue that this disparity in the state's capacity to contain political dissents is a result of the weakening of social networks during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). Thus, measuring social power in the context of the dominance of state power is critical in understanding the degree of autonomy from the state intellectuals enjoyed in twentieth-century China.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Law, Autonomy, China, Chinese law, Chinese news media, Chinese press, Civil society in China, Law, Media culture, News media, Politics, Print culture, Social networks",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

Looking at the approaches taken in the colonies of British Asia, postwar treason trials in the Philippines, and Chinese Communist approaches in wartime and postwar Shandong province, this study argues that the laws and rhetoric of treason were deeply flawed tools for confronting the atrocities of war. At the very moment that war crimes trials were defining a set of acts that constituted crimes against all humanity, around the world thousands of individuals who helped perpetrate them were treated as primarily guilty of crimes against the nation. Each of the chapters in this work examines the costs and consequences of this for postwar societies on the eve of decolonization and civil war. Throughout the territories under Japanese occupation, locally recruited military and police forces comprised the largest category of individuals to face accusations of treason in the aftermath of war, but were also those most likely to be complicit in atrocities. Among the ranks of the disloyal, they were both the most useful as well as the most dangerous to postwar regimes and almost always separated out from other accused collaborators. Their treason was often treated as a disease of the heart which, once cured, allowed them to be deployed once more. Attempts to try them for their betrayal often faced destabilizing political opposition, especially in cases where their wartime actions were carried out in the name of independence from colonial rule, and were almost always reduced in scale to focus on those accused both of treason and atrocities. Marred by the politics of betrayal, the resulting hybrid proceedings failed to achieve a reckoning with wartime massacres and torture.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,History,History,"History, Modern history, Atrocities, British Empire, China, Japan, Philippines, Treason, War crimes",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304599081,"Wang, Dan",A comparative study of state violence in mainland China and Taiwan in the 1950s,Contemporary,"How do totalitarian and authoritarian regimes maintain political control? One of the key strategies is to create social fear. In the case of the political history of both mainland China and Taiwan in the 1950s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT) used various methods, such as political mass movements and rule by the secret police, to carry out state violence to create social fear. Based on a comparison of the state violence of mainland China and Taiwan in the 1950s, this thesis addresses the following questions: How does an authoritarian power stabilize control through state violence? What are the institutions of state violence? How is state violence achieved through psychological factors? A general examination of the political movements and suppression on each side on the Taiwan Strait, as well as specific case studies, i.e., the case of Hu Feng on the mainland and the case of Lei Zhen on Taiwan, reveals the following commonalities: the extension of the attack from the political arena to the social arena and the concomitant transformation of state violence from a political issue into a social issue, extending to every level of society. I also examine the role of the top leaders, Mao Zedong and Chiang Kaishek, to carry out state violence and the strategies used by the regime to carry out the plans of the respective top leader. Based on this analysis it is argued that under totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, violence is not simply a means to maintain control. Instead, it provides an institutional support for the regime. In the case of mainland China in the 1950s, the state violence was an integral part of the CCP ideology that sought to transform society. Violence is effective because it creates omnipresent fears in society--fear of mutual-accusations between colleagues, fear of being watched by the secret police, and fear that personal opinions might lead to punishment. Such fears lead to self-censorship, first by individuals and then by the entire society. State violence establishes a prison in every individual's inner consciousness, and this prison is the secret to the success of the dictatorship.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Modern history, China, Nineteen50s, State violence, Taiwan, Violence",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
1750645784,"Liu, Yan",Toxic cures: Poisons and medicines in medieval China,Medieval,"This dissertation explores the medicinal use of poisons in China from the third to the tenth century, which is when the major outlines of Chinese toxicological thought took shape. Challenging a widespread view that contrasts the benign naturalness of Chinese herbal remedies with the dangerous side effects of Western synthetic drugs, my research highlights the centrality of poisons to the practice and theory of medicine in China. Chinese doctors regularly relied on a large number of substances that they recognized as toxic to combat sickness, and identified toxicity as the central pillar for the classification of drugs. I argue that the boundary between poisons and medicines was always hazy in medieval China. it was not the substance itself, but how it was used and experienced that mattered. To examine this crucial yet ignored feature of Chinese medicine, my dissertation develops the following themes. The first is that drugs in medieval China were not fixed entities with unique effects. The effect of a given substance—whether it healed as a medicine, or sickened or killed as a poison, or altered a person in myriad other ways—varied both with usage and with processing. Subsequently, Chinese doctors developed a variety of techniques (the dosage, the drug combination, and the drug preparation) to mitigate the toxicity of a poison while preserving its therapeutic potency. Secondly, I highlight the intimate relation between bodily experience and the understanding of poisons. By studying the alchemical practice of ingesting toxic minerals, I show that the violent bodily effects induced by these substances were often perceived as confirmations of efficacy rather than worrying signs of pathology. My third theme is the circulation of toxicological knowledge across geographical and social domains. I argue that standardized textual knowledge propagated by the state was fluidly transformed in practice, contingent upon the availability of pharmacological ingredients and the needs of local people. Finally, I turn to non-poisons, especially foods, in Chinese pharmacy, and identify a distinctive character of Chinese medicine—the ingestion of mild substances to nourish the body and prolong life.

305190005,"Virag, Curie K.","That which encompasses the Myriad cares: Subjectivity, knowledge, and the ethics of emotion in Tang and Song China",Medieval,"This is a study of the diverse, intriguing ways in which thinkers in China, from the sixth to the twelfth centuries, understood and made sense of the emotions. It traces the role of emotions in their ethical visions and seeks to construct an intelligible history of how, in this period of profound change, prominent thinkers conceived of the self and the sources of order, meaning and value in human life. Methodologically, I have attempted to open a space for intellectual history that goes beyond the search for the social, cultural, and political contexts of thought, on the one hand, and the history of “philosophical doctrines” and intellectual lineages, on the other—approaches that have dominated the historical study of past thought. My inquiry proceeds through an examination of the shifting philosophical discourse surrounding the concept of qing —the term in Chinese most commonly rendered as “emotion.” Rather than tracing the history of meanings of qing per se , I examine the notion in terms of the ethical and conceptual predicaments of individual thinkers. I begin with Liu Xie's (ca. 465–522) ambitious literary treatise, the Wenxin Diaolong and the early Tang collection of Classics commentaries, the Wujing Zhengyi (mid-seventh century). These early visions serve as the backdrop to my discussion of Tang and Song thinkers: Han Yu (768–824), Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), Shao Yong (1011–1077), Zhang Zai (1020–1077), Su Shi (1037–1101) and Zhu Xi (1130–1200). Historically, my study shows that the intellectual landscape of the Tang and Song periods was composed of vastly different ethical visions of thinkers who, faced with the reality of an uncertain, fragmented world, put forth a diverse range of proposals to reconcile the sense of division between inner and outer, personal experience and objective meaning. Philosophically, it demonstrates the deep ambivalences and complexities that characterize thinking about emotions, providing further insight into the ways in which emotions are linked to the processes of conferring meaning and value.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Philosophy, Asian literature, China, Ethics of emotion, Knowledge, Song dynasty, Subjectivity, Tang dynasty",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304347356,"Foster, Robert Wallace",Differentiating rightness from profit: The life and thought of Lu Jiuyuan (1139-1193),Medieval,"The Southern Song (1127-1279) is often acknowledged as an important period in the intellectual development of imperial China. During this period the Confucian revival that had marked the Northern Song was continued by a number of important figures, one of whom was Lu Jiuyuan. Lu Jiuyuan is best known for his ethical philosophy stressing the importance of the mind. His thought has often been discussed as a foil to that of Zhu Xi (1130-1200), which was adopted as state orthodoxy in the thirteenth century. Since Lu Jiuyuan's thought provided a strong critique of Zhu Xi's, it proved a important source of intellectual alternatives in later eras. However, what is often overlooked in discussions of Lu Jiuyuan is the link between his philosophy and his life. One of the arguments of this dissertation is that a figure's thought can be best understood when seen in light of the historical context of that figure. At the same time, this dissertation uses the form of intellectual biography as a means of critiquing historical issues pertaining to our understanding of the Southern Song. With these considerations in mind, the dissertation is divided into five chapters. The first introduces the methodological bases of the dissertation, a brief discussion of the historical context, and a short outline of the issues dealt with in the following chapters. Chapter Two examines three intellectual alternatives represented by the lives of Lu You (1125-1210), Ye Shi (1150-1223), and Zhu Xi. Chapter Three looks at Lu Jiuyuan's extended family and the influence his upbringing had upon his philosophy. Chapter Four gives a systematic discussion of Lu Jiuyuan's ethical philosophy. Chapter Five explores the connection between Lu Jiuyuan's ethical philosophy and both his political philosophy and political practice as a member of the local elite and as a local official.

This dissertation studies Southern Song discourse on good government against the background of a vast intellectual change during the period from late 11th century Northern Song (960-1126) through early Ming (1368-1644). In the aftermath of the New Policies (1068-1126), the full-scale state activist reforms that ended up in dynastic fall, Southern Song literati thinkers reflected on the consequences of this reform in history. Their discourse developed into a sustained constitutional discourse, which continued throughout Southern Song, forming a strong intellectual movement. They shifted the underlying paradigms of imperial rule through a critical historical assessment of the New Policies and a fundamental re-interpretation of classical antiquity. They changed the constitutional schemes in the received classics of antiquity, redefined good government by reviving the fengjian doctrine, and formulated constitutional plans for reorganizing state society relations for later imperial China. Their theories of government generally gained dominance in academe and defined the standard visions of imperial politics during the 12 th to 13 th century China. Finally, Jinhua literati who advised the founding emperor in the Ming Founding considered Southern Song constitutional discourse on good government for the enactment of Ming legislation. The early Ming case was an outgrowth of Southern Song constitutional discourse on good government.

612703432,"Chen, Dandan",Politics and ethics: Zhang Junmai and the search for a new ethical life in modern China,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the transformation of politics and ethics, as well as their interaction in modern China, through a case study of Zhang Junmai (Carsun Chang, 1886–1969), one of the most important New Confucian thinkers, and known as the “Father of the Chinese Constitution.” In this project, I examine how modern Chinese intellectuals such as Zhang Junmai endeavored to establish a new political community and a new ethical life, after the breaking of the traditional unity between politics and ethics in modern China. I argue that Zhang is a unique intellectual—not only the father of Chinese constitution, but also one the founders of modern Chinese political philosophy. My dissertation is the first to discover and examine the hidden “Carl Schmitt” element in Zhang Junmai's political thought, which was neither mentioned by Zhang Junmai himself during his lifetime, nor examined by previous scholarship. This dissertation is also the first to systematically explore Zhang's theoretical assimilation of his Western forerunners and contemporaries, such as Carl Schmitt and Harold Laski. This research challenges the common perception that the search for wealth and power was the main theme in twentieth-century China, by highlighting another main thread: the search for a new ethical life. By examining the change of morality and the invention of modern ethics, as well as Zhang Junmai's idea of constructing a “ Gemeinschaft ” (political and ethical community), this work responds to the core question posed by Heidegger and MacIntyre: whether and how ethics is possible in the modern age. This dissertation examines how Zhang negotiates the tension between politics and law. I argue that Zhang does not understand democracy as a purely legal concept which can be completely understood by scientific approaches. rather, Zhang calls on a kind of inner politics, which emphasizes a change of people's political habits and consciousness. While insisting on making Chinese citizens the “political subjects” of a modern, democratized state, Zhang also emphasizes the establishment of an ethical community by transforming these political subjects into the moral subjects of democracy.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Philosophy, Political science, China, Democracy and morality, Ethics in China, Modern China, New Confucianism, Politics and law, Zhang, Junmai",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

This period witnessed the failure of plans to shape the collective action of bureaucrats and coordinate market actors through a host of organizing mechanisms. I explain why the policy makers in this historical process failed to incorporate and organize the ideas and interests of social actors, political elites and relevant bureaucracies into the state’s authoritative action. I argue that this failure was an outcome of the interaction between the political philosophy of the drafters of the New Policies and their historical context. In particular, it was a result of the incapacity of the drafters’ worldview to correctly explain and resolve unexpected problems in the policy environment, including the influence of political philosophies that were in fundamental conflict with the ideas of Wang Anshi, as well as the reaction of political elites to the New Policies, the rationales and behavioral modes of bureaucrats in financial markets and state monopolies, and unpredictable changes in the marketplace that bedeviled bureaucrats.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"History, Philosophy, Political science, China, New Policies period, Political philosophy, State building, Wang Anshi",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305592726,"Kim, Youngmin",Redefining the self's relation to the world: A study of mid -Ming neo -Confucian discourse,Modern,"Neo-Confucianism was a vast intellectual movement that was launched in Song China and that continued to exert great influence in the countries of East Asia, including Japan, Korean and even Vietnam. By the mid-Ming period in China, it found itself in the midst of a major intellectual transformation, undergoing its most lively philosophical effervescence since its formative stage. My dissertation explores the Neo-Confucian discourse of this time. Methodologically, I have attempted to overcome various limitations in existing scholarship, which tends to be devoted to individual thinkers, and sought to provide a wide-ranging contextual treatment of various currents of thought during this period. Also, to explicate what Neo-Confucianism meant to its practitioners, I explore in depth a cardinal philosophical assumption of Neo-Confucianism that was particularly important in mid-Ming Neo-Confucian discourse: the unity between self and world. Without this philosophical underpinning which allows an individual moral agent to contain within himself the whole world, the Neo-Confucian project, which upholds personal morality as the main fulcrum of social well-being, cannot be theoretically sustained. By combining these approaches of history and philosophy, I offer a new lens for understanding each of the remarkable thinkers that emerged at that time—Chen Xianzhang (1428–1500), Hu Juren (1434–1484), Zhan Ruoshui (1466–1560), Luo Qinshun (1465–1547), Wang Tingxiang (1474–1544), and Wang Yangming (1472–1529). My account of each thinker seeks to prove that each thinker's philosophy can best be understood as varying responses to the crisis of the moral self in the mid-Ming. In general, mid-Ming thinkers enriched Neo-Confucian thought in the sense that they managed to articulate new conceptual modes by which to recuperate the moral self. Although mid-Ming thinkers' philosophical gymnastics represented their endeavor to save Neo-Confucianism, their philosophies, taken together, reveal certain features of the general intellectual milieu at that time. That is, intellectuals contested the idea of the unity of the world—the assumption that made it possible to conceive the individual self as more than an isolated ego. With this shift in the way in which individuals thought about themselves, Neo-Confucianism found itself not just in transformation but also in crisis.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Philosophy, Religious history, China, Ming dynasty, Neo-Confucian discourse, Self",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
915051818,"Hill, Joshua Benjamin",Voting as a Rite: Changing Ideas of Elections in Early Twentieth Century China,Contemporary,"There is a long history of voting in mainland China. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, influential Chinese thinkers argued that elections were part of a “worldwide trend” of leaders actively engaging their populaces in politics. Officials of the last dynasty, in the final years of its rule, embraced this notion—as has every succeeding government. None of these regimes, however, claimed power on the basis of the ballot box alone. Thus, the historical significance of China's elections lies not in their political consequences, but in what they reveal about changing political values and ideas. My dissertation argues that Chinese political thinkers initially saw elections as a mechanism for selecting talented and moral officials. Suffrage was restricted to those presumed to have the ability to discern these qualities and the elections themselves were competitive. In Chapter 1, I link the origins of this system to the political structures of late imperial China through an analysis of the writings of prominent intellectuals. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 use contemporary newspaper accounts to investigate how this system of voting operated, and how it was critiqued, during the Qing-sponsored 1909 elections, the new Republican government's 1912 elections, and elections held during the “warlord era” of the late 1910s and early 1920s. By the 1920s, many political activists lost confidence in this electoral system, which seemed to elevate only the ambitious and corrupt to office. Elections thus presented a problem for mid-twentieth century theorists and political leaders: they were necessary, yet unappealing. Chapter 5 draws on archival materials to explore how later governments, ranging from the “autonomous” provincial governments of the early 1920s to the one-party dictatorships of the Nationalist and Communist parties, experimented with universal suffrage elections that were designed to be consensual and noncompetitive. Unlike earlier elections, this system of voting was primarily intended to “educate” voters about the state's values. The history of Chinese elections as told in my dissertation is not a history of Chinese democracy—instead, it is a history of how experiments with different systems of voting both reflected and shaped popular attitudes toward politics.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Political science, Campaigning, China, Elections, Jiangsu Province, Legislatures, Newspapers, Parliament, People's Congresses",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304850079,"Kennedy, Andrew Bingham","Dreams undeferred: Mao, Nehru, and the strategic choices of rising powers",Contemporary,"This dissertation explains how the leaders of rising powers make foreign policy, focusing on Maoist China and Nehruvian India. For several reasons, rising states might be expected to act conservatively in foreign affairs. Rather than fighting more powerful rivals in the present, power transition theory suggests they will defer such conflicts until they have grown stronger. Rather than making costly diplomatic commitments, rising states might seem more likely to shun constraints on their future power. Historically, however, rising powers have sometimes acted with remarkable boldness. When will rising states bide their time and when will they not? This study argues that these decisions are powerfully shaped by the national efficacy beliefs of individual leaders. Building on psychological research and international relations theory, it identifies two kinds of national efficacy in particular: martial efficacy, or the proficiency of a state at military combat, and moral efficacy, or the ability to shape international norms through diplomacy. When sufficiently robust, these beliefs inspire the leaders of rising states to assert themselves before their rise is complete. Strong martial efficacy beliefs prompt leaders to play up the opportunities, and play down the dangers, of ambitious military moves in the present. Strong moral efficacy beliefs do the same in diplomacy. Different national efficacy beliefs thus lead to different strategic choices. This framework helps explain the very different courses charted by China under Mao and India under Nehru. As hypothesized, Mao proved more willing to challenge stronger states militarily, as evidenced by his interventions in Korea and Vietnam. In contrast, Nehru proved more willing to make costly moves in diplomacy, as shown by his approach to Kashmir and nuclear disarmament. This project contributes to the study of international relations in several ways. Focusing on efficacy beliefs, it provides new insight into how political elites make foreign policy. It also brings to light new historical evidence acquired through archival research and interviews in Beijing, Nanjing, New Delhi, Mumbai, Boston, and London. Lastly, it offers a comprehensive theory of how rising powers make strategic choices, with important implications for the study of China and India today.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Political science, International law, International relations, China, Foreign policy, India, International relations, Mao, Zedong, Nehru, Jawaharlal, Rising powers, Strategic choices",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304502108,"Yoon, Seungjoo","The formation, reformation, and transformation of Zhang Zhidong's document commissioners, 1885-1909",Contemporary,"This dissertation analyzes Zhang's commission system between the 1880s and 1900s, focusing on the social backgrounds and behavioral patterns of his document commissioners and their roles in the evolution of the modern Chinese political system. The document commissioners were an institutional outgrowth of the advisory staff system and intellectual brainchild of the statecraft tradition. Zhang's document commissioners, however, went a step further. They shared a strong collective identity that emerged in the late nineteenth century, when intense internal disorder and identity that emerged in the late nineteenth century when intense internal disorder and external aggression produced a sense that without adequate structural reforms China faced possible extinction as a civilization. The document commissioners belonged to the stratum of both bureaucratic interns and personal clients, and their special role was to operate in certain marginal sectors such as foreign affairs of various kinds. In addition, they served in semi-public institutions, most notably in an officially supervised newspaper company, actively cultivating multiple patrons outside their host patronage network. The routinization of the document commissions constituted an important transitional phase in the evolution of the modern Chinese polity. The commissioners, or contemporary advisory staff members, served as a substantial de facto expansion of the official class and thereby became the bearers of modern ideas and administrative practice. Because of the nature of China's political economy, political reform did not emerge from the merchant class or “new middle class” but primarily from the official class. This is the essential background for understanding present-day reform movements within the Chinese Communist Party. Occasionally reform-minded bureaucrats have become involved in a popular movement (1989) with disastrous results. Nearly a century earlier, a similar temptation almost ruined the editorial writers of Zhang Zhidong's newspaper commission, who wrote articles with radical messages to appeal to people both inside and outside government. The activities of the document commissioners thus demonstrate the tenacity of the traditional power configurations of the Chinese state even in its modern manifestations.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Public administration, Journalism, China, Document commissioners, Foreign affairs, Newspaper, Statecraft, Zhang Zhidong",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
303905365,"Queen, Sarah A.",From chronicle to canon: The hermeneutics of the Spring and Autumn Annals according to Tung Chung-shu,Ancient,"This dissertation examines Tung Chung-shu's efforts to establish a scriptural basis for imperial sovereignty and his influence in shaping the relationship between textual authority and political power in the traditional Chinese state. Drawing upon his previously unexamined exegetical writings, this study explores Tung Chung-shu's conceptions of the ontological status and functional roles of the Spring and Autumn Annals and his contributions to the canonization of this text under Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty. Part One, a study of Tung Chung-shu's literary corpus, reevaluates the traditional attribution of the Ch'un-ch'iu fan-lu (The Luxuriant Gems of the Spring and Autumn Annals). It suggests that this text is most likely a compilation of a wide variety of sources with varying degrees of relation to the historic Tung Chung-shu and should not be accepted as entirely from the hand of this Han master. Part Two, the focus of the study, reconstructs Tung Chung-shu's legal, ritual, and cosmological interpretations of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Chapter Three is a brief introduction to pre-Han interpretations of the Annals. Chapters Four and Five demonstrate that Tung's interpretations of the Annals as both a book of judgments and a code of ethical principles had a significant impact on the practice of Han law but that his influence on the religious practices of Emperor Wu was more limited. Chapter Six argues that Tung's cosmological interpretations of the Annals were influenced by Huang-Lao thought. By conflating the Taoist ideal of nature with the Confucian conception of Heaven, Tung established a cosmological foundation for his text-based theology. Collectively these chapters show that Tung Chung-shu's interpretations also reflected his efforts to reform Ch'in institutions. Moreover, his ideal of an alternative religious and political culture for the Han was characterized by an emphasis on the value of simplicity which distinguished him from other Confucian scholars. The conclusion considers the significance of Tung Chung-shu's interpretations for the study of comparative scripture and Confucian religiosity.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Religion, Law, Asian literature, China, Confucianism",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305526233,"Tuttle, Gray Warren",Faith and nation: Tibetan Buddhists in the making of modern China (1902–1958),Contemporary,"In the present work, I analyze one aspect of how the dynastic Qing empire became the modern Chinese nation-state through the effort to include Tibet as part of the new China. In so doing, I offer insights into the impact of the global forces of nationalism, race, and religion on social organization in East Asia. The territory of East Asia's largest empire, the Qing dynasty, has largely been preserved in the nation-state of the People's Republic of China. In the case of Tibet, the rhetoric of nationalism and racial unity proved largely powerless to effect this transition. Instead, religion served as the pan-Asian link between the social organization of the dynastic empire and the nationstate. I examine Tibet's inclusion as part of how contemporary China defines itself in order to demonstrate the crucial role that Buddhists played in China's transition from a dynastic empire to a nation-state. I also explore the nexus of religion and nation and argue that religion cannot merely be associated with “tradition” that is ultimately displaced by “modernity” in the form of the nation. My findings demonstrate that within the context of the modern nation-state religious traditions are readily adopted and adapted by both state actors and members of religious institutions to advance their respective interests. The central thesis of my dissertation is that Buddhism was the key factor in maintaining a tenuous link between China and Tibet during the Republican period (1912–1949), a link that the Communists preserved when exerting control over Tibet by force in the 1950s. For this reason, I argue that Buddhist religious culture played an essential role in the formation of the modern Chinese nation-state. The majority of this dissertation is devoted to understanding the efforts of Buddhists and politicians to integrate Buddhist culture and modern Chinese politics. I have combined the methodologies of historical analysis of specific cases of religious, educational, and political interaction with a comparison across time of the changing or continuing nature of these relations.

Among these biographical entries are numerous indications of the charismatic or miraculous powers attributed to these religious leaders. While traditionally historians of China have avoided or discounted for their legendary qualities such materials as miracle tales and attestments of religious powers, the present study deliberately analyzes those hagiographies with the strongest presence of miracle stories and tales of superhuman abilities. By considering the specific concerns of Daoxuan, the compiler of the hagiography, in his attention to the miraculous elements in Buddhists' lives, I present an explanation of the principles behind the powers of Buddhist adepts and the various social and political tensions arising from these powers. This study is divided into three major chapters. The first section, Buddhism, Biography and Power, presents an historical overview of the sixth and seventh centuries, followed by essays providing general backgrounds on the history of Buddhism in this period, the tradition of Chinese and Buddhist biographical writing, the life and career of Daoxuan, and comparative approaches to the studies of saints and cults in other cultures and time periods. The second major division uses examples from the Continued Lives to describe the features of monks' powers and social authority as evidenced in their biographies. Finally, the third division of my thesis lays out a categorization of various religious powers found in the biographies and explains how Daoxuan managed through his compilation to present a resolution to the social and political tensions arising from the Buddhist monks' access to such powers.

304527982,"Chen, Hsi-yuan",Confucianism encounters religion: The formation of religious discourse and the Confucian movement in modern China,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the complexities and flux in the conceptualization of the generic Western concept of “religion” in the course of social, cultural, and political movements from late-Qing to early Republican China. Central to the study is the indeterminacy of meaning in the transition from Chinese traditional discourse on jiao to the Western modern one on “religion,” and how the collision of these two discourses affected the evaluation of Chinese elite of their traditions as well as their agenda on the transformation of China. Before “religion” was introduced into China, the traditional discourse of “ jiao (teaching)” defined cultural traditions. Confucianism was placed at the center of comparisons and considered to be the archetypal jiao . When the modern Chinese equivalent to the foreign concept of “religion/ zongjiao ” gradually overwhelmed the antiquated usage of jiao and became a legitimate category in cultural discourse, the religiosity of Confucianism became a point of controversy that has inextricably haunted the modern Chinese history since. Mainly prompted by worldly concerns, the “Defending Confucianism” movement in the late Qing still oriented its discussions from within the traditional framework of jiao . Regardless of their philosophical and political differences, Kang Youwei and his contemporaries shared the pressing need to popularize Confucianism and make Confucianism more accessible to commoners, who had long been ignored as a source of support. As the predominance of Confucianism over other jiao was diminished along with the overthrow of monarchial order, the Confucian Religion Association ( kongjiao hui ) established in 1912 signifies that Confucianism had to compete with those jiao that were now categorized as “religious” groups. Initiated by the Confucian Religion Association, the debate over the enshrinement of Confucianism as the National Religion in the making of the constitution engenders much disjunction and confusion. This can be attributed to difficulties arising from trying to reshape the traditional relationship between zheng (government) and jiao (Confucianism) according to the Western notion of the modern nation-state on the one hand and the neologism “religion” on the other. In fact, the notion of a written “constitution,” and the implications of a bifurcation between church and state were utterly foreign to the Chinese mind of the time, and are perhaps even still misunderstood by some to this day. The neologism “religion” was inevitably imprinted onto Chinese discourse at the turn of the century as “Western jiao ,” with all the colored associations of the West's colonialist and proselytizing encounter with China. The Chinese perception of “religion,” then, was evidently affected and deflected by their understanding of Christianity. This bias was consequently embodied in the partial convergence of the Anti-Religious Campaign and Anti-Christian Campaign in 1920s. Religion in general was delineated as a misleading “superstition” that would delude the populace. For many intellectuals the mission of “enlightening the populace” entailed the emancipation of all people from every form of “superstition,” understood to be “religion.” Consequently, the advocacy of the Confucian religion was engulfed by a counter-current to de-religionize Confucianism, a movement which has basically set the tone for many decades to come. Yet, Confucianism as a “religion” was and is not doomed. While Western religious discourse has been questioning the identification of Confucianism, the ambiguous nature of Confucianism has also been challenging the fluid Western definition of “religion.” Now, at the end of this century, the demarcation between “religion” and jiao has become somewhat blurred again.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Religious history, China, Confucian, Religion",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

I use the term “religiosity” to refer to the multiple ways in which the people of Ji'an interpreted and manipulated the realm of higher forces that affected their lives and deaths. This religiosity is of particular interest because the sources demonstrate that many “social actors” on the local scene attached great importance to this religiosity. Many regional and national groups of “actors” represented in local society were interested in asserting their authority over the religiosity of commoners by suggesting their own interpretations of the religious realm. This dissertation chronicles two processes of change. the gradual change in the religiosity of the common people, and the changing ways of manipulating this religiosity and their different rates of success. Religiosity during the Southern Song dynasty is based on the availability and diversity of options. The importance of access to a range of options means that boundaries within which interpretations of the outer realm exist are constantly shifting, while the communities within which such interpretations exist are also fluid. The analysis of Yuan dynasty sources suggests a high degree of continuity between the Southern Song and Yuan. By the later Ming the diversity of options still exists, but the importance of an integrated community within which a tradition of practice is shared also begins to feature. I suggest that the emphasis on cohesion and small-scale integration in Ji'an does not appear in written sources until the middle of the Ming dynasty. Throughout this period both representatives of the central government and local literati attempted to impose their own interpretations of the religious realm on local population. While government-based narratives of local religiosity change dramatically throughout this period, the effect of that change is much less noticeable on the local level. Analysis of literati narratives yield a more significant change. Throughout the Southern Song and Yuan dynasties literati use religion to give themselves a voice of authority in local society.

While social commentators of the time could link science and national empowerment in abstract terms, Chinese scientists had to grapple with the practical consequences of using foreign systems based on universal truth claims in service of national goals rooted in local attachments. In particular they faced two ongoing challenges in saving China ( jiuguo ) through science: how to develop objective, internationally recognized scientific authority without effacing native identity, and how to serve China when China was still searching for a stable national form? This dissertation argues that Republican geologists solved these problems by being flexible and inclusive about theories and alliances, but unswerving in their commitment to native control of the Chinese land. Though the Chinese geological community adapted easily to shifting socio-political realities, it only offered allegiance to the territory itself. Though the chapters of this dissertation follow a roughly chronological order, each one is organized around a problem of geological development tied to the land but conceived and addressed through the imperative of saving the-nation. Chapter 2 opens by asking why Chinese became interested in modern geology at all, and how they began to reconceptualize their homeland as an object of study. Chapter 3 explores the role of fieldwork in grounding the Chinese geological enterprise and reinventing the modern Chinese intellectual. Chapter 4 analyzes Chinese efforts to forge community and participate in international science by establishing the Geological Society of China as a meeting place for competing foreign powers. Chapter 5 looks at how Chinese geologists tried to balance their own ideas of geology to save the nation with the growing demands of the Guomindang state in the Nanjing Decade (1927-1937). Chapter 6 examines how the Japanese occupation of China's coastal regions during the War of Resistance narrowed the focus of Chinese geology and set the stage for geologists' post-war disillusionment with the Guomindang.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Science history, China, Geology, Nationalism, Republican",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305336423,"Hinrichs, TJ",The medical transforming of governance and *southern customs in Song dynasty China (960–1279 C.E.),Medieval,"This dissertation charts Northern Song (960–1126 C.E.) policies to “educate and transform” southern mores and customs. These expanded in scope to target responses to disease, especially the eschewing of medicine and the avoidance of contact with the sick during epidemics. They also intensified in approach to include the dissemination of medicines and of medical texts, the arrest and flogging of local shamans, and attempts to make them practice medicine. It examines these policies in relation to views of southern deviance, increasing integration of the south into Song China, transitions in the ruling élite, and political, moral, and cultural agendas that were served by them. The textual, social, and political activities of Song élites that involved them in medicine conditioned their responses to disease-related practices in the south. As officials, they oversaw and participated in the compilation, production, and distribution of medical texts. The Northern Song government expanded the medical bureaucracy and medical examinations. set up medical schools, pharmacies, and hospices. and distributed medicines to victims of epidemics. These activities raised the stakes of non-specialist medical discourse and controversy from something relevant primarily to family or individual choices in healing alternatives, to something with greater implications for political choices, social status, and cultural identity. Whereas southern practices of avoiding contact with the sick had elicited policy responses in the Northern Song, in the Southern Song (1127–1279 C.E.) such responses were, in keeping with the Southern Song withdrawal from activist governance, rare. Instead, the same concerns generated debates over whether epidemics were contagious. In order to better follow these debates, this dissertation explores functional-configurational and ontological-contaminationist theories of epidemics across medical, Daoist, and literati texts. Some élites advocated a narrowly canonical functional-configurational style of medicine, and found this incompatible with the demonic and contagious ontological-contaminationist views of disease of shamanic and exorcistic healers. On the other hand, most élites and most physicians preferred a more eclectic approach to handling disease, employing exorcism and avoiding the sick when deemed appropriate. Others did not deny the contagion of epidemic diseases, but asserted the moral imperative of caring for the sick despite threat of transmission.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Science history, Religious history, China, Customs, Governance, Medical transforming, Song dynasty, Southern",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304621929,"Gerth, Karl Gregory","Nationalizing consumption, consuming nationalism: The National Products Movement in China, 1905–1937",Contemporary,"How did an emerging commodity culture define and spread modern Chinese nationalism? Conversely, how did Chinese nationalism and anti-imperialism influence the shape of that commodity culture? This dissertation argues that two of the most influential forces shaping modern China—namely, nationalism and commodity culture—were closely related. Each played a fundamental role in defining the other. Nationalism defined a burgeoning commodity culture by applying the categories of “national” and “foreign” to all commodities. and that commodity culture became the site where the notion of nationality was articulated and practiced. To counteract treaty restrictions and a weak central state, a broad array of political, economic and social forces—working under the twin banners of anti-imperialism and nationalism—erected cultural constraints on consumption through a full-scale “National Products Movement” ( guohuo yundong , or NPM). The NPM popularized the meaning of material culture around the duality of “national products” ( guohuo ) and “foreign products” ( yanghuo ). Moreover, it tried to make “product-nationality” the preeminent way of interpreting commodities. Western-inspired urban fashion trends, Chinese Marxism, and other possible techniques for defining commodities were considered less important, misleading, or even treasonous within the NPM. Above all, the NPM aimed to create an environment where every item, as marked by its production and distribution, became either foreign or domestic. and every act of consumption either a nationalistic or treasonous statement. Using Chinese and Japanese archival and bibliographic sources, this dissertation, in four parts, constructs the first comprehensive interpretation of the NPM. The first part provides a case study of the nationalization of men's personal appearance (hairstyles and clothing). The second part links the NPM to frequent anti-imperialist boycotts that violently linked consumption and nationalism. The third part reveals how commodity spectacles, such as “national product” museums, retail stores, exhibitions, and advertising, more subtly naturalized a Chinese/foreign split of this new commodity culture. And the final part addresses the impact of the NPM on gender norms.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Social structure, Cultural anthropology, China, Consumption, National Products Movement",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304433676,"De Weerdt, Hilde Godelieve Dominique",The composition of examination standards: Daoxue and Southern Song dynasty examination culture,Medieval,"After the eventful institutional reforms of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries, early Southern Song politicians established an institutional framework for the examinations that remained firmly in place until the end of the dynasty. Examination standards, however, continued to be subject to intellectual and political debate. The Southern Song government's early commitment to non-partisan selection standards created space for teachers, editors and publishers to define curricular standards. Through an investigation of governmental regulations, examination encyclopedias and prose anthologies, and examination expositions and policy essays, this dissertation investigates how different types of agents and different sociopolitical and moral value systems shaped examination standards. It advances an interpretation of the civil service examinations as a cultural system whose conventions provided the context within which the intellectual and political agendas of the court, high officials, examiners, teachers and literati at large had to be negotiated. In this context, this study adds a missing piece to the puzzle of the success of Daoxue/The Learning of the Way in the late Southern Song period. It discusses how the examinations functioned as a key location for the adaptation, extension and contestation of Daoxue ideology. The ascendancy of Daoxue ideology has previously been attributed to its imposition as state orthodoxy in 1241, or to the appeal of its rejection of an examination degree as the hallmark of the scholar-official. The analysis of its adaptation to the conventions of examination culture shows that its success was also due to the development of alternative kinds of examination preparation and examination writing by its proponents.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Social structure, Education history, Educational evaluation, Asian literature, China, Civil service examinations, Daoxue, Examination standards, Song Dynasty",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305332653,"Chen, Ta-Ko","Organizing authority: Office, rank, and status in Tang China",Medieval,"This dissertation studies the organization of the Tang government and the two components in its ranking systems: substantive office and titular office. The role and function of the Tang titular ranking system, critical to our understanding of Tang society, is largely neglected in existing scholarship. Premised on the Weberian concept of bureaucracy, the dissertation analyzes the role of titular rank and its interaction with substantive rank in the functional context of Tang bureaucracy. Chapter one examines the idea of government from the Han to the Tang, and demonstrates that in the Tang conception, government was to be rationally organized with functional goals. The next two chapters analyze the organization of substantive offices in the Tang central and local government, demonstrating that two principles—administrative functionality and imperial centrality—underscored the hierarchy of Tang substantive ranking system. Chapter four discusses the titular ranking system, where relation between titular rank and social status is illustrated. It shows that titular rank, while initially determined by an individual's family background, was linked to one's performance in substantive office, and thus functionally integrated into the bureaucracy. The concluding chapter argues that it was through the titular ranking system, whereby social status was translated into mechanical measurements, that the Tang state was able to thoroughly incorporate an independent social force into its bureaucratic framework. Thus, the titular office system represents the Tang response to an historical quandary, namely, how to re-establish a centralized authority after the devolution of political power and the resultant rise of great clans in medieval China. The implication of the titular office system is that the dynamics from the interaction between titular and substantive offices during the Tang fundamentally modified the conception of social status and imperial power for the next millennium in China.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"History, Social structure, Public administration, Authority, China, Office, Rank, Status, Tang dynasty",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
4480000075,"Hua, Rui ","Peasants versus Empires: Transnational Civil Justice and National Legal Decolonization in Manchuria, 1881-1951",Contemporary,"This dissertation offers a transnational legal history of peasants, merchants, and migrants in the Manchurian borderland. Drawing on previously unexamined sources from seventeen archives and numerous non-archival collections in Northeast China, Taiwan, Russia, Japan, and the United States, the dissertation shows how this battleground of empires, quite paradoxically, was also the breeding ground for a new form of normative imagination about transnational justice from below. Amid the game of great powers in Northeast Asia, millions of migrants mingled with the local population in Manchuria. As settlers and sojourners traveled across the Great Wall, over the Sea of Japan, and through the steppes of Russia, they brought new repertoires of legalities and legal sentiments into the borderland. By examining the hundreds of transnational litigation records they left behind, this dissertation reconstructs the desires and anxieties of borderland inhabitants as they navigated a world overflowing with multinational laws. Through many stories of legal inventiveness in property, debt, and resource exploitation, I demonstrate how the Manchurian borderland emerged as a generative site of transnational lawmaking. Unlike the formal laws and state legal interventions that played a key role in the emergence of modern legal culture in China proper, I argue that Manchurian borderlanders made law through make-believe techniques, imaginative performances, and border-crossing maneuvers. Audacious as they were, the norms of private legal transactions that took shape in this world then reshaped colonial and national sovereignty. The dissertation begins by describing the Russian intervention in Manchuria at the turn of the 20th century, demonstrating how, through its railway imperialism, the Russian empire unwittingly laid the groundwork for a unique form of inter-imperial legal pluralism in the region. Relying on materials in Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and English, I show how, in the years of Sino-Japanese rivalry that followed, borderlanders developed this legal consciousness into a transnational legal vernacular, using legal claim-making as an effective strategy of anti-colonial social action. The dissertation goes on to show how the Japan-sponsored colonial state of Manchukuo (1932-1945) attempted to coopt borderland legal energy by introducing a property regime that it regarded as legally legible. Ultimately, however, its machinations merely disrupted the existing transnational structure of rights. When the Japanese empire fell, the Nationalists and Communists each hurried to offer a vision of legal decolonization, aiming to dismantle the Japanese legal legacy. I make the case that the Nationalist project of legal decolonization foundered because of its ill-timed incorporation of Republican Chinese civil jurisprudence. Having unleashed a legal tsunami in the courts, the Nationalist rights restoration movement paved the way for what I call liberal decolonial socialism, which followed in the years immediately after the end of the Civil War. Where prevailing narratives on East Asian international law often privilege the ordered legislative spaces of China’s coastal metropolises, I foreground the other spaces of norm-making in East Asia and focus on transnational legal strategization at the grassroots. The dissertation aims to show that frontier “badlands,” often marginalized in the histories of modern law, were just as generative for the norms that defined transnational legal modernity. That is, legal modernities did not travel solely through state mediation from Berlin and Paris to Beijing and Tokyo. They also emerged from the forested hills, rice paddies, and mining pits of the lived transnational space. This study of Manchuria in the first half of the 20th century thus offers an alternative local history for the emergence of the modern legal culture of the (post)colonial Global South. It also challenges conventional narratives about nationalist identity and colonialism in Northeast Asia. The prevailing account suggests that via techniques of inclusion and exclusion, imperialism helped engender national identities. Yet the findings presented in this dissertation suggest that legal actors instrumentalized their identities not to create boundaries but to cross borders and build alternative alliances. As I demonstrate, the juridical processes in which they engaged laid bare the instability of imperial ethno-national categories, even as these same processes hailed into being a new transnational legal subject. This legal subject, defined by a regime of private rights and by a high degree of mobility, defied the framework of national state building, even if the end result at times led to new, transnational forms of dispossession.The findings presented in this dissertation also compel us to rethink the story of decolonization in China. It has often been suggested that decolonization was either unnecessary or unthinkable under the banner of Maoist Revolution. I argue, however, that the decolonial imagination defined the horizon of expectations for the postcolonial population in Manchuria. The story of the Manchurian postcolony shows the asynchronic temporalities of decolonization in different regions of China, thus enabling a reconsideration of China’s relationship with the legacies of colonialism.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Legal deolonization, Manchuria, Peasants, Transnational civil justice,",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
3830000062,"Coleman, Fletcher","Building a Discipline: The Longmen Grottoes and the Formation of East Asian Art History in the U.S., ca. 1900-1955",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines how the needs of a new class of art professionals in the United States, trained and led by Langdon Warner (1881-1955), spurred methodological developments within the early field of East Asian art history. Predicated on my rediscovery of major bodies of unprocessed documents from the papers of Langdon Warner and his pupils, I argue that these individuals utilized antiquarian traditions associated with plaster casts and ink rubbings to inspire early methods for the restoration, exhibition, and teaching of East Asian art. In particular, I take the activities of Warner and his students at the Longmen Grottoes 龍門石窟 as a microcosm for how these ideals became embedded in objects during the removal, restoration, and display of sculpture from the site. Chapter one introduces the early training and fieldwork of Warner. Although he was pivotal in the establishment of the field, little has been written about this aspect of his life. I highlight Warner’s formative visits to Longmen that bookended his early experiences in China. Chapter two explores the methodologies of Warner and his students, Laurence Sickman (1907-1988) and Alan Priest (1898-1969), through the removal and restoration of the imperial processions of the Binyang Central Cave賓陽中洞 at Longmen. Through newly rediscovered photographs and documents, the restorations of the reliefs are analyzed in detail for the first time, showing how the pieces became physically embedded with evolving notions of pedagogy and display. Chapter three introduces the case of a Vimalakīrti relief removed from the same cave. Through analysis of its historiography and physical state, I propose that the relief represented a turning point for Sickman and Warner regarding their pedagogical methods. Chapter four examines the ink rubbings collected by Warner’s circle during their visits to Longmen and how they utilized these collections for instruction. Unlike most early antiquarians who emphasized epigraphy, they placed greater emphasis on rubbings of images. Through examination of the properties of their rubbings and writings on the medium, I argue that Warner and his students conceived of rubbings as unique aesthetic objects and as analogous to plaster cast collections.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,History of Art and Architecture,Art and Architecture,"Longmen Grottoes, Binyang Central Cave, Imperial Processions, Empress Procession, Emperor Procession, Warner, Langdon, Sickman, Laurence, Priest, Alan, Ecke, Gustav, Theodore Bowie, Plumer, James Marshall, Restoration, Conservation, Ink Rubbings, Plaster Casts, Historiography, Art Historiography, Collecting History, History of Collections, Chinese Sculpture, East Asian Art, Japanese Sculpture, Pedagogy, Fogg Museum, Nelson-Atkins Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, Freer Gallery of Art, Indiana University, Bloomington, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, First Fogg Expedition, Second Fogg Expedition, American School of Archaeology in Peking, Sinology,",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

304599318,"Sun, Chengjuan",Rewriting the Southern Tang (937–975): Nostalgia and aesthetic imagination,Medieval,"My dissertation deals with the highly mediated perception of Southern Tang culture by scholars of subsequent periods, and with the selective appropriation and coloration of that past culture for the purposes of the present. It deals with selected episodes, spanning from the late tenth century to the seventeenth century. In 907 the Tang Empire disintegrated into a dozen dynasties and states. The Southern Tang (937-975), one of the most powerful and populated southern states, enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, remaining one of the cultural centers of the period between 907 and conquest of the Southern Tang by the Song Empire in 975, in the course of its reunification of China. Almost all the extant texts from the Southern Tang underwent changes made by Song dynasty scholars as they edited, commented upon, emended and reconstructed the texts during the three centuries following the conquest. One must rely on the Song sources on the Southern Tang, on mediated rather than direct knowledge. Therefore, my approach to the Southern Tang is to examine the Song—to examine their reconstruction of the Southern Tang, studying the selective and slanted versions and legends they produced, and the processes of imagination, projection, and appropriation that produced them. Chapter One investigates the underlying ambivalence inherent in the Song historiography of the Southern Tang. Chapter two explores a legend-making process in the reception of Southern Tang literature, by examining frame stories and autobiographical interpretations that contextualize the lyrics of the last ruler Li Yu. By exploring the Northern Song scholars' artistic pursuits in light of the cherished Southern Tang fine stationery, I wish to show in Chapter Three the influence of Southern Tang culture in nurturing the eleventh century scholars' love for arts and their active engagement in aesthetic undertakings.

303677976,"Lam, Joseph Sui Ching",Creativity within bounds: State Sacrificial Songs from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 A.D.),Modern,"As the first comprehensive study on the Ming Dynasty State Sacrificial Songs which represent the highest realization of the Chinese concept of Proper Music, my work contributes to music scholarship with facts about a previously unknown corpus of music, and new insights on relationship between music and its context. A repertory of 322 songs is established through examination of one music treatise and four authentic notated sources which are multi-volumed ritual manuals of the period. The context of the songs is reconstructed from music treatises and historical documents on the sacrifices, emperors, and the Ming court as a social and musical nexus. Detailed analysis demonstrates the musical features of the songs. The sources, the songs and their context reveal a complex music phenomenon. Contextual elements, such as theories on ceremonials and music, historical conventions, and personalities, contributed much to the establishment of the musical styles of the songs and to the maintenance of their tradition. In other words, the contextual elements produced a series of constraints for the composition of the songs, leading to the formulaic quality in the music. However, the songs are still individualistic expressions of art, and show stylistic changes. This is because the songs were composed with a creativity that functioned within bounds. By examining the Ming State Sacrificial Songs from musical and non-musical perspectives, my dissertation provides crucial facts in the understanding of the Chinese pursuit of Proper Music which is a dominant feature in the history of Chinese culture. By stressing the relationship between context and musical creativity, my study addresses the problems in understanding formulaic music as expressions of its culture and as creative statements of art.",1988,1988,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Music, History, China",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
305585666,"Wu, Jiang","Orthodoxy, controversy and the transformation of Chan Buddhism in seventeenth-century China",Modern,"This dissertation investigates the transformation of Chan Buddhism in seventeenth-century China through the lens of a series of controversies motivated by the claim of orthodoxy. The particular case examined here is the Huangbo lineage within the Linji school. Because the third Huangbo master Yinyuan Longqi emigrated to Japan in 1654, this lineage spread throughout Japan and led to the establishment of the Ōbaku (Huangbo) school in Japan. In this study, I focus on three Huangbo masters: Miyun Yuanwu (1566–1642), Feiyin Tongrong (1593–1662) and Yinyuan Longqi (1592–1673). All three masters had been abbots of Mount Huangbo in Fuqing, Fujian province and were bonded by the relationship of dharma transmission. My study suggests that Chan Buddhism in seventeenth-century China was a systematic reconstruction and reinvention of a Chan ideal that was characterized by the performance of encounter dialogue and a hierarchy of dharma transmission. Motivated by the Linji school's forceful claim of orthodoxy ( Linji zhengzong ), the Huangbo masters engaged in three major controversies in seventeenth-century China. The controversy between Master Miyun Yuanwu and his disciple Hanyue Fazang, taking place around 1635, concerns the authenticity of the Chan enlightenment experience. Interestingly, this controversy was finally judged by the Yongzheng Emperor a hundred years later. The second controversy, about the legitimacy of dharma transmission, led to a lawsuit in which Feiyin Tongrong, the second Huangbo master, lost the case and his book Wudeng yantong was ordered to be burnt in 1654. In addition, the Huangbo master's orthodox position also propelled them to play a leading role in anti-Christian polemics. As a result, Miyun Yuanwu and Feiyin Tongrong organized an anti-Christian campaign from 1634 to 1640. I conclude that significant transformations of Chan Buddhism took place in seventeenth-century China. Chan Buddhists revitalized ancient Chan ideals embodied in the lively performance of encounter dialogue and the practice of dharma transmission. The result of this re-invention was the emergence of a new orthodoxy within Chinese Buddhism. The establishment of the Japanese Ōbaku school through emigration and overseas missionary work of the third Huangbo master Yinyuan Longqi was a direct result of the transformation of Chan Buddhism in seventeenth-century China.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Art History, Buddhism, Chan Buddhism, China, Controversy, Orthodoxy, Seventeenth century",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
613689957,"Kim, Youn-mi",Eternal ritual in an infinite cosmos: The Chaoyang North Pagoda (1043–1044),Medieval,"This dissertation examines the relationship among space, ritual, and cosmology in medieval Buddhism by means of a comprehensive analysis of the pagoda, the most representative architectural typology of East Asian Buddhism throughout its two-thousand-year history. The Chaoyang North Pagoda (1043–44), a Liao-dynasty (916–1125) structure in northeast China whose excavation was completed only in the 1990s, provides an excellent focus for such a study. After Buddhism was transmitted from India to East Asia, a cosmological scheme of unprecedented sophistication, which consists of an infinitely expanding multiverse framed by a fractal-like structure, was developed in the seventh century by the Huayan school, a uniquely East Asian Buddhist sect. Examination of the Chaoyang North Pagoda reveals that it was designed to be an architectural epitome of the trichiliocosm described in the literature of the Huayan school. It conceptually transforms physically finite architectural space into an infinitely expanding cosmic space. Thus, examination of this space allows us to see how an Indian architectural prototype—namely, the stupa, which was envisioned to be the center of the cosmos—later developed in China. More importantly, however, it suggests that Buddhist architectural structures should be viewed as embodiments of vision rather than understood only in terms of their physical shape. Further examination of the inner space of the pagoda reveals that its relic crypt simulated a miniaturized version of the altar for chanting the Buddhist incantation known as the Usn isavijaya Dharan i . This suggests that the pagoda was designed not simply as static reliquary on an architectural scale but was intended to be a dynamic space wherein the benefits of ritual could be extended infinitely and eternally. The discovery of this ritual altar inside a permanently sealed space raises further questions regarding our present notions of ritual and ritual space. Lastly, my comparison of the ritual altar configuration from this Liao pagoda with documents concerning a twelfth-century Japanese ritual brings this study into transnational dialogue. It reveals hitherto unknown connections between continental ritual practices and the purportedly indigenous Japanese esoteric ritual known as the Nyoho Sonsho Ritual, practiced by the Shingon school since 1109. This discovery testifies to the importance of the Liao dynasty, which is drawing increasing academic attention due to recent archaeological excavations, in completing our understanding of the landscape of medieval East Asian politics and religion.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Art history, Buddhism, Chaoyang North Pagoda, China, Eternal ritual, Huayan, Liao, Ritual altar, Shingon",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
856603282,"Inouye, Melissa Wei-Tsing",Miraculous Mundane: The True Jesus Church and Chinese Christianity in the Twentieth Century,Contemporary,"This dissertation centers on the history of the miraculous mundane: the worldview within the True Jesus Church, informed by its exclusivist claims and an emphasis on literal Biblical adherence, in which supernatural efficacy is a central aspect of ordinary believers' lived religious experiences. At the time of the church's founding in 1917, the visions and miracles attributed to the church's early leaders provided the basis for the divine authority claimed by the True Jesus Church as its members sought to overturn existing ecclesiastical hierarchies. Influenced by the transnational Pentecostal movement, the church's emphasis on the miraculous mode of Christianity allowed Chinese Christians within the True Jesus Church to engage directly with the Bible and to assert superior spiritual authority over well-established rival denominations. This miraculous mode of Christianity is not unique to the True Jesus Church but is also a central feature of the history of Chinese Christianity. While previous studies of the significance of supernatural efficacy in Chinese Christianity have rightly called attention to congruence with Chinese popular religious practices, this study contributes an in-depth consideration of the church's transnational Pentecostal influences and believers' experience of Christianity on their own terms. During the Republican era (1912–1949), the miraculous mundane worldview was especially significant in disrupting traditional hierarchies within the world of Chinese Christianity, giving native churches the opportunity to claim greater legitimacy than Western denominations and giving women the opportunity to exercise spiritual authority usually reserved for men. Throughout the Maoist era (1949–1976), the miraculous mundane worldview persisted within the True Jesus Church at the grassroots level long after the church's institutional structures had been co-opted or eliminated by the party-state. The historical centrality of this miraculous mode and its compatibility with grassroots practice helps to account for the robust resurgence of miraculous worldviews in contemporary Chinese Christianity.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Asian Studies, China, Chinese Christianity, Christianity, Miraculous, Pentecostal, True Jesus Church",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

While Mingben never left southeast China, he attracted followers from throughout China and from abroad. These followers were not only Buddhist monks but also elite lay men and women. Mingben refused to head large monasteries, but instead traveled and lived in the small cloistered communities that he founded in the Jiangnan region. Thus he was a figure of both religious and cultural importance but also one who stood outside the monastic mainstream. Mingben's approach to the study of Chan rejected reliance on the textual tradition and instead demanded rigorous, long-term attention to the cultivation of mind. This underlying religiosity was central to all his pursuits, in both Buddhist and literati realms. My study is divided into three parts. The first two chapters consider the context and construction of Mingben's life.

A translation and analysis of Hsieh's commentary on the Analects, drawn from the composite work Lun-Meng ching-i (Essential Meanings of the Analects and Mencius) compiled by Chu Hsi (1130-1200), forms the basis of this study, and selections from it are included in the Appendix. For Chu Hsi and his contemporaries, it became an issue whether or not Hsieh's interpretations of the Analects, and particularly his controversial understanding of jen as chueh (awareness, sensitivity), represented an authentic transmission of Confucian teaching as taught by the Ch'eng brothers. This research thus demonstrates some of the variety and intellectual tensions within the Tao-hsueh fellowship, particularly in terms of the dynamic of savoring the scriptural and traditional resources (wan-wei) and attaining personal realization (tzu-te), and also highlights concern with the status of teaching lineages such as that of the Hunan scholars. lt also tends to show that the understanding of jen was a much more central issue for the Tao-hsueh masters than is generally represented in the secondary literature. In comparative perspective, these concerns with authentic transmission and the learning of jen (jen-hsueh) can be seen as bearing significant similarity to the practice of theology in the West, as manifesting a four-fold interpretive pattern comprised of scripture, tradition, reason, and experience. Thus, Hsieh Shang-ts'ai's thought and the Tao-hsueh movement in general, and by implication the resources of the Confucian tradition as a whole, are worthy of consideration in the wider context of comparative religion and comparative theology.",1994,1994,Th.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, China, Lun Meng ching i, tao hsueh",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
303714716,"Kwok, Pui-lan","Chinese women and Christianity, 1860-1927",Contemporary,"This study examines the relationship between Chinese women and Protestant Christianity from 1860 to 1927, using the writings of Chinese women and the collection of Chinese tracts and papers of the American board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions as primary sources. The historical background of Protestant missions in China during this period is provided, focusing on issues pertinent to the encounter of Chinese women and Christianity. The Christian message communicated to the Chinese audience is reconstructed by means of a careful analysis of missionary popular literature, showing that the feminization of Christian symbolism in China enhanced the appeal of Christianity. The experiences of women in the Christian church is then described, with reference to religious activities for women in the local setting and the evolving patterns of religious leadership. The formation of peer bonds and the development of leadership in churches and mission schools enabled Chinese Christian women to move into the public arena. The study shows that Christian women sought to apply maternal roles and feminine qualities practiced in the home to society when they initiated various social reforms, such as the anti-footbinding movement, temperance, health campaigns, and family reform. Broadened social involvement provided a critical context for women to reflect on their own religious faith and their Christian identity, as seen in women's conversion stories, autobiographies, testimonies, and religious writings. The study argues that the relationship between Chinese women and Christianity changed over time and was much more complex than hitherto assumed. Christianity was faulted in nineteenth-century China for elevating the status of women, but it was condemned as patriarchal and conservative in the 1920's. Further, the development of the consciousness of church women was significantly influenced by the wider feminist movement in China. The ideal of the equality of the sexes made Christian women more aware of sexual discrimination in the church, and criticisms of Christianity during the anti-Christian movement (1922-1927) prompted these women to engage in a feminist critique of Christianity.",1989,1989,Th.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Womens studies, 0",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
304297948,"Zhang, Qiong",Cultural accommodation or intellectual colonization? A reinterpretation of the Jesuit approach to Confucianism during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries,Modern,"This dissertation takes issue with the cultural accommodation thesis prevalent in the previous scholarship on the Jesuit missionary strategy in China, particularly on the Jesuit approach to classical and Neo-Confucianism, venturing a counterargument that the spirit and essence of the Jesuit strategy should be characterized as intellectual colonialism. This argument is presented through an interpretation of the role of Western Scholastic learning in the Jesuit missionary agenda. The dissertation situates the Jesuit mission to the late Ming China within the context of cultural confrontation, highlighting the profound impact of Western intellectual traditions and attainments, particularly Platonic metaphysics and Aristotelian-Scholastic natural philosophy, logic, and models of argumentation, on the development of the doctrines and theoretical framework of Catholic theology on the one hand, and the fundamental embeddedness of Confucian spirituality, both classical and modern, in Chinese moral, metaphysical, cosmological, and medical discourses on the other. Tracing the evolution of the Jesuit approach to Confucianism during the first six decades of the mission, particularly the crucial period from the emergence of the Ricci Method to the reassessment, rediscovery, and elaboration of it by Matteo Ricci's successors through their controversy on the question of terms, the dissertation demonstrates how the Jesuits' deepening awareness of the cultural dimension of the Catholic-Confucian confrontation informed their increasingly methodical uses of Western Scholastic learning in their intellectual dialogues with the Confucian-minded audience. It takes Matteo Ricci's metaphorical description of his foundational project--clearing the soil, sowing the seeds, and awaiting the season of harvest--as a point of departure, and reconstructs that project by examining the representative Chinese works of Matteo Ricci, Nicolaus Longobardo, and Julius Aleni, showing how they employed Western Scholastic learning, in the name of extolling universal reason and truth, to Christianize Confucian classics, which they seemingly appropriated, and to refute the teachings of Neo-Confucianism and other Chinese religious traditions. This study thus concludes that the transmission of Scholastic learning, both in apologetic context and in the form of systematic translations and adaptations, constituted the centerpiece of the Jesuit missionary endeavor in China, the goal of which was to effect a foundational and paradigmatic transformation in Chinese culture in hope of a total religious conversion.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Science history, History, Religious history, China, Ming, seventeenth century, sixteenth century",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

This research reviews Beijing's urban development in the past one hundred years and explores the interaction between its urban forms and their social, economic, and political contexts. Key moments are selected to demonstrate two pairs of relationships, which are the most determinant factors forming Beijing in the twentieth century. (1)&#xa0.Political centrality and spatial centrality. (2)&#xa0.Modernization and Chinese expression in the city form (Chineseness) Beijing's urban development is closely related to its political status. During times when the nation is united under a strong government and Beijing is designated the capital, such as in Imperial and Communist eras, Beijing is reformed to manifest its power and legitimacy by emphasizing its geographical center. A series of master plans and architectural strategies were developed to realize this centrality and to create an identity for the city. On the contrary, when Beijing loses its capital status, its spatial centrality dissolves and the city is depoliticized. Although there were moments when Beijing could have adopted other spatial patterns, these attempts failed in the end. Beijing in the twentieth century is experiencing a series of efforts to achieve modernization. Meanwhile, as the capital of the late Imperial China and as a masterpiece of ancient city planning, Beijing's modernization process inevitably encounters the question of how to deal with its historic heritage. On the one hand, the city has to change constantly to fit the requirements of modern society. On the other hand, its form has to keep continuity from the past and maintain its Chinese identity. The requirements of Chinese expression serve as a filter for the government to develop a safe path to modernization without being affected too much by foreign influences. The city has been continuously redefined and redesigned under the forces of these two goals and different experiments were attempted throughout the twentieth century. In the last part of the research, some suggestions are made to establish a more comprehensive and sustainable development model for Beijing.",2006,2006,D.Des.,United States,Harvard University,NA,NA,"Urban planning, Area planning & development, History, Beijing, Centrality, China, Modernizing",111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States

Previous accounts about the """"age of discoveries"""" of the Renaissance have focused on the importance of centralized empirical accumulation of geographical data that expanded the classical Ptolemaic worldview. This dissertation argues instead that cross-cultural translation played a significant role. I show that roughly between 1550 and 1650 there was a significant, possibly unique, reciprocal process of translation connecting Chinese, Inner Asian and European ways of depicting the world. This process had two dimensions: the translation of Chinese world maps in Europe and the translation of European world maps in China and Inner Asia. The dissertation analyses this process by looking at the interconnected stories of three maps: the 1584 map of China by Abraham Ortelius, the 1602 Map of Myriad Kingdoms by Matteo Ricci and Li Zhizao and the Manchu translation of a 1603 version of the """"Ricci map."""" These three stories are prefaced by an overview chapter discussing the key features of Chinese and European maps before their encounter in the second half of the 16th century.

2641867467,"Duan, Ruodi ","Ends of Solidarity: China, Tanzania, and Black Internationalism, 1960-1972",Contemporary,"At the height of the Cold War, postcolonial state representatives and transnational activists struggled over the premises and boundaries of Afro-Asian unity. This dissertation traces the making and unmaking of 1960s Afro-Asianism along two arcs: on the one hand, the interface of Chinese officials with U.S. civil rights and Black Power activists, and on the other, the cultural and political engagements between Chinese and Tanzanian nationalists, diplomats, and civil society delegates. It presents these narratives side by side while attuned to their interstices, highlighting how Afro-Asian visions, in the years after the 1955 Bandung Conference, persisted in the continued interaction between ideas of Black internationalism and Asian socialism. But these Afro-Asian discourses tended to rely on the demarcation of other Third World formations of solidarity as the foil, and enduring debates over the role of Pan-Africanism and Black nationalism in relation to class struggle impeded this postcolonial expression of Afro-Asian solidarities. This story is bookended by a series of events in the early 1960s, from Tanganyikan independence to the intensification of the Sino-Soviet Split, and by U.S.-China rapprochement and the assassination of Zanzibar’s President Abeid Karume in 1972. In deconstructing the heterogeneities and contingencies of post-Bandung Afro-Asianism, this dissertation contributes to the interdisciplinary scholarship on the Cold War, China and Africa, decolonization, Black internationalism, comparative ethnic studies, and twentieth-century formations of international society more broadly. It draws from national archives, personal collections, and political ephemera in China, the United States, the United Kingdom, mainland Tanzania, and Zanzibar. In addition to the Sino-Soviet Split, it considers seriously the 1960s conflict between China and India, as well as the fraught histories of Arab engagements in Sub-Saharan Africa, as fault lines with significant fall-out for the contours of coalition politics in the Third World. Its focus on the multi-faceted role of racial and ethnic politics in Afro-Asian constructs also offers insight into the Third World entanglements of the local and global, lived experiences and interstate diplomacy, colonial legacies and the postcolonial imaginations of new world orders. The possibilities of racial co-identifications both facilitated and inhibited the potential of Afro-Asian unity. Chapters 1 and 3 examine how Chinese officials and propagandists foregrounded racial sensitivities in their appeals to African American civil rights activists, a strategy that proved relatively effective in light of Soviet and Cuban failures to demonstrate an equivalent appreciation of race and racism. But the Black Power activists who centered space, land, and power in their correlation of self-governance for minority nationalities in China with visions of Black nationalism saw their calls for self-determination become overwritten in Chinese narratives of U.S. civil rights activism. Chapters 2 and 4 reconstruct the negotiation of relations between Chinese representatives and African nationalists in mainland Tanzania and in Zanzibar. Anti-Indian and anti-Arab sentiments in postcolonial Tanzania, widespread as a result of British colonial policies that granted economic and social privileges to the Indian and Arab minorities, dovetailed with the Chinese campaign to denounce Indian revisionism and Indians as imperial collaborators in light of mounting geopolitical contest between the two countries, which culminated in the 1962 Sino-Indian Border War. Thus, in spite of an official rhetoric of Afro-Asian unity, the development of China-Tanzanian relations relied on the vilification of India, on account of its alleged provocation of Sino-Indian Border War and the role of its East African diaspora in upholding and benefiting from the structures of colonialism.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,History,History,NA,111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
2680346329,"Yi, Jongsik","Christian More-Than-People’s Communes: Veterinary Workers, Nonhuman Animals, and One Health in Mao-Era China",Contemporary,"Long before COVID-19, global health experts and citizens perceived China as a past and future epicenter of pandemic disease. The high density of its human and nonhuman populations, the prevalence of wet markets, and the relentless destruction of its ecology have been linked to the authoritarianism of its government and the apparent political submissiveness of its people. This dissertation historicizes this perception by examining the communal veterinary system during China’s Maoist period (1949–1976). I show the bottom-up efforts to preserve the vitality of humans, domestic animals, and the environment through the work and knowledge of local “people’s communes.” At the center of these initiatives were large numbers of local veterinary workers. Veterinarians, animal disease prevention workers, animal caretakers, and breeders undergirded the economic, intellectual, and moral order in which farm animals and veterinary expertise were regarded as common goods. I argue that prior to the post-1978 capitalist reforms in China, there were “more-than-people’s communes,” or places where diverse humans cared for, healed, and exploited nonhuman beings to weather the revolution’s radicalism and unpredictability. This dissertation complicates the understandings of rural China, Maoist mass science, and human-animal relations. First and foremost, I ask a historiographical question: Despite famine, exploitation, and violence in rural China, how did local communities persevere and survive? Engaging with historians and social scientists who have studied the subsistence ethics, agency, and forms of resistance of local individuals and communities, I claim that to fully appreciate such communal capacity for subsistence and well-being, we must recognize the contribution made by nonhuman animals. Local veterinary workers were at the forefront of enabling and sustaining the animal contributions to communal survival. They were by no means elite experts, but rather products of the ideal of mass science, or an anti-technocratic, popular democratic, and even “decolonial” vision of science. While bringing the cases of veterinary workers to the scholarly conversation about mass science, this dissertation reshapes the discussion about mass science by insisting that the ideal within grassroots veterinary spheres was enacted through not only human action but also by animal initiative. Foregrounding human-animal relations within more-than people’s communes, this dissertation does not insist that “animal agency” was equal to or even more significant than that of local state cadres, veterinarians, or peasants. Instead, it juxtaposes human and nonhuman actors whenever possible. In so doing, I do not erase the presence of diverse farm animals in the communes and I seek to denaturalize anthropocentric and eugenic aspects of the communal life.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,Harvard University,History of Science,History of Science,NA,111,Cambridge,Massachusetts,42.3759,-71.1185,United States
250884685,"Stevens, Sarah Elizabeth","Making female sexuality in Republican China: Women's bodies in the discourses of hygiene, *education, and literature",Contemporary,"This work examines the construction of female sexuality in Republican China (1911–1949) by investigating images of women's bodies in texts on hygiene, education, and literature. Discussions of women and female sexuality were a vehicle for displacing (and displaying) social anxieties. This focus on sexuality influenced the codification of body culture, as various politically-charged discourses advocated specific images of the ideal woman. Hygienic texts were an important site for the convergence of nationalism, eugenics, and science, resulting in the medicalization of female sexuality, family life, and parenting—all of which were turned into objects for “scientific” analysis. Texts on fetal education, reproduction, and menstruation use rhetoric that co-opts formerly private spaces (the womb, the household, and the temporal space of childhood) for the nation-race. This hygienic image of the ideal woman prioritized the reproductive body. The ideal woman found in texts discussing body-centered education (sex education, physical education, and hygiene education) echoes this socially-conservative rhetoric. Here, the influence of eugenics is even stronger, constructing a “flawless” woman whose mission is the creation of a flawless body and flawless children. Educational articles posit this ideal in conscious opposition to images of beauty found in pictorial magazines, in popular fiction, and even in the visual material accompanying the articles themselves. The resulting tension between verbal and visual images of women reveals the conflict between coexisting ideas of female sexuality. Literary images of women add two other “ideal women” to this picture: the “new woman” and the “modern girl.” The distinction between these archetypes reveals contrasting attitudes towards modernity and female sexuality, and also reflects the rivalry between the national and the cosmopolitan. Depictions of the modern girl reveal that she is sometimes used by (female) authors to explore female subjectivity and free expression of sexuality. At other times, she is used by (male) authors in the form of a femme fatale, a symbol of male anxiety about female sexuality and the alienation of modernity. All of these images existed in a web of shifting tensions and alliances, creating a complicated picture of female sexuality in Republican China.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Indiana University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Womens studies, History, China, Education, Hygiene, Literature, Sexuality, Women's bodies",15,Bloomington,Indiana,39.1637,-86.5257,United States

304222190,"Wang, Chi-ying Alice","Revisiting Shen Zhou (1427-1509): Poet, painter, literatus, reader",Modern,"The dissertation focuses on the relationship between word and image in the works of the Chinese poet-artist Shen Zhou. Going beyond standard literary or art historical studies by adopting an interdisciplinary approach akin to that of modern culture studies, it investigates pertinent traditions and contemporary conditions in 15th-century Chinese thought, painting, poetry, and society in order to achieve a fuller understanding of literati painting as exemplified by Shen Zhou's work. Chapter One traces the theme of nature portrayed as landscape, the principal subject matter of literati painting, to its roots in Daoism and Confucianism: while the Daoist thought prevalent from the third to the sixth centuries accounts conceptually for the rise of landscape painting as an independent genre, Neo-Confucian thought, dominant since the eleventh century, placed man at the center of the landscape in literati paintings during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Chapter Two explores both formal and conceptual relations between Chinese poetry and painting and the interaction of pictorial image and inscription within one work. Three preeminent poetic devices identifiable in the earliest lyric poems constitute basic structural elements of the literati artist's self-inscribed paintings, where pictorial image and verbal text often form a rich network of allusions both to literary and to artistic traditions. The vital connection between the post-artist's life and his work is underscored in Chapter Three. Re-investigating the socio-economic and cultural (or socio-cultural?) contexts of Shen Zhou's life in Suzhou, the chapter also redefines what it meant to be an artist literatus in his time. The final chapter deals with Shen Zhou as a reader of earlier artists' work, and with the intended readers of his own. It argues that the way he and other Ming literati painters read verbal texts led them to redirect their response to earlier inscribed paintings from an emphasis on the pictorial representation of nature toward the inscribed text, which helped shape the canonical tradition of literati painting. The multidisciplinary perspective adopted throughout this study elucidates the conditions governing the production of these inscribed paintings and the significance they held for Shen Zhou's contemporaries.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,Indiana University,NA,NA,"Comparative literature, Art History, History, Biographies, China",15,Bloomington,Indiana,39.1637,-86.5257,United States

However, existing studies evaluating Dewey's influence on China have failed to take Dewey's own thoughts and experiences into account. This dissertation examines Dewey's visit from his own perspective as a teacher and a learner. In chapter two, I explore Dewey's role as a teacher by examining the diverse images associated with him while he was in China and his own aspirations as a democratic and benevolent teacher. In chapter three, I look at the reception of Dewey's ideas, which fluctuated with major events of the time. I review left-wing accusations about Dewey's political thought and traditionalist challenges to his educational ideas. Some of these criticisms were ideological, while others resulted from underlying differences in cultural beliefs and practices. In chapter four, I examine what Dewey learned from his experiences as a political commentator, a goodwill ambassador, and a cultural anthropologist. In his long sojourn, he came to question Eurocentric conceptions of the world and to understand China on its own terms, as evidenced in his evolving views about the May Fourth movement, about the responsibility of America in the Far East, and about Chinese ways of life. In chapter five, I compare Dewey's political writings prior to and after his visit to show how Dewey's learning in China may have influenced the subsequent development of his political thought. His learning about Chinese history and politics seemed to have compelled him to reconsider the meaning of internationalism and to clarify the relations between the public and the state. Most importantly, Dewey's exposure to the communal culture of Chinese society enabled him to perceive the limitations of democracy understood solely as a form of government and to emphasize the idea of community life as a more secure foundation for democracy.

The instrumental view of nationalism sees ethno-national communities as being created only in the process of modernization. In the prolegomena, I challenge this view and show how commonly-held group stereotypes of Chinese and Mongols, intensified by disparities in modernization, generated powerful anxiety about survival among the Mongols, which in turn fueled ethnic conflict. These stereotypes supplied the Mongols as a whole with a common language of racial anxiety and group entitlement. At the same time, 'advanced' groups among the Mongols, especially the Kharachins and Daurs of eastern Inner Mongolia, played a crucial role in organizing nationalist movements such as the People's Revolutionary Party of Inner Mongolia (PRPIM), which was the main vehicle of revolutionary nationalist politics in Inner Mongolia from 1924 to 1931. Disparities between 'advanced' and 'backward' groups within the Mongols also played, however, an important role in disrupting the Inner Mongolian nationalist movement. In Parts I to III, I reconstruct a narrative history of this party from 1925 to 1929. I first examine the attempts of the party's Chinese-educated leadership to mobilize rural Mongols in 1925 and 1926. Secondly, I show how the 1927 party split between pro- and anti-Communist factions was also a response to conflicts between the East Mongolian nationalist party leaders, who thought in all-Mongolian terms, and western Inner Mongolian supporters who shared their anxieties over the future of the Mongols but did not have the same modernizing and all-national perspective. In the third part, I examine two Mongol uprisings in 1928 and show again how mobilization based on common subscription to ethnic anxieties was blocked by disagreement over the conception of the Mongol nation. The conclusion examines the failure of this period of nationalist mobilization. I argue that the ethnic and political context in which the Mongols operated inclined them towards purely secessionist politics which had little chance for ultimate success.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,Indiana University,NA,NA,"History, Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, China, Mongolia",15,Bloomington,Indiana,39.1637,-86.5257,United States

I suggest the new interpretation of Celestial Writing in Daoist Shangqing texts provided for a synthesis of the traditional notion of wen , the idea of heaven's mandate and the Buddhist idea of Sanskrit as Celestial Writing. The Shangqing approach presents more than ever a cosmologically oriented perspective of Celestial Writing, and thus created a new vision of textual tradition. Later, in Shangqing and Lingbao traditions, scriptures are conceived as sacred because their celestial prototypes are powerful primordial emblems, crystallizations of the primordial pneuma that are accessible only to the high deities who transmit them down to lesser deities, until a feeble version intelligible to chosen saints can be revealed to humans.

305583381,"Edgerton, Kathryn Jean",The semiotics of starvation in late-Qing China: Cultural responses to the “Incredible Famine” of 1876–1879,Contemporary,"This dissertation focuses on Chinese cultural responses to trauma, particularly reactions to the massive famine that killed at least ten million people in North China in the late 1870s. The heart of this exploration of how culture is involved in giving meaning to disaster is an analysis of local-level famine accounts from Shanxi Province, where the famine was most severe. I also examine famine texts written by Qing officials and treaty-port philanthropists. Moreover, the drought-induced famine in North China coincided with a major famine in British India, and both catastrophes received widespread coverage in Shanghai-based Chinese and Western newspapers. Depictions of the “Incredible Famine” of 1876–79 thus provide provocative examples of conflicting Chinese and Western nineteenth-century assumptions about famine causation and famine-relief measures. Throughout this study I conduct close readings of famine texts in order to identify the particular images that observers of the disaster chose to symbolize the famine, and I ask how different groups in nineteenth-century China interpreted famine causation, defined heroes, villains, winners, and losers during the crisis, determined which members of a starving family were most or least expendable, and formulated plans to prevent future famines. This exploration of how China's Confucian traditions contributed to structuring late-Qing responses to disaster is informed by cultural histories of the Great Irish Famine of 1945–49. While my primary focus is on how Chinese observers of famine used their own cultural resources in an attempt to order mass starvation within a conceptual framework and make it socially meaningful, I constantly place Chinese discussions of the famine in dialogue with nineteenth-century British debates on how to represent and respond to a major subsistence crisis. A close examination of the “semiotics of starvation” in Chinese and Western depictions of this famine, then, contributes to cultural and trans-national history by addressing questions such as: what can the unique images chosen to represent famine tell us about a culture's response to trauma, and to what extent can interpretations of famine cross national and cultural boundaries?",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Indiana University,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, China, Cultural responses, Incredible Famine, Qing dynasty, Semiotics, Starvation",15,Bloomington,Indiana,39.1637,-86.5257,United States
1461435426,"Fan, Xin",The making of an alienated past: The study of ancient world history in twentieth-century China,Contemporary,"In China today the exclusion of China's own past from world-historical studies indicates a binary view of the relation between China and the world—a binary which is the end result of certain cultural, social, and political transformations in the twentieth century. In this dissertation, I first focus on the aspirations, struggles, and setbacks of a group of individuals who sought to connect the ancient world to modern Chinese society in their study of history. This resulted in the establishment of ancient world history (AWH) as a branch of modern historical studies. The introduction, circulation, appropriation, and production of AWH knowledge took place in the contexts of rapid socio-political changes, one of which was the professionalization of historical studies. This generated a tension which grew throughout the century: On one hand, it increased the state's capacity to control historians by turning them into professional workers in modern academic institutions. on the other hand, it created an aspiration among historians to maintain an autonomous view, justified by their authoritative position in knowledge-production. Evolving from an amateur tradition of historical writing in the early twentieth century, the development of AWH in China became gradually fraught in this conflict of professionalization from the 1930s onward. In the 1950s, the Communist state turned AWH into a professional field and cultivated historians who accepted Marxist historical materialism and Marxist-defined universal stages in world history. Many non-Marxist historians felt this as an intrusion on their autonomy as professional knowledge-producers, and, seeing Marxism as foreign, they stressed the boundaries between China and the world to exclude the exterior influence of political ideology. This emphasis on cultural difference became even more open when ideological strictures were loosened in the 1980s and 1990s, leading to the alienation of AWH in post-Socialist Chinese historiography. Thus, this alienation in historical writing was an unintended consequence of a social drama among historians, one that arose from the repeated conflict between political demands and aspirations for professional standards.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,Indiana University,History,History,"History, World History, China, Historiography, Knowledge production, Political ideology, Professionalization, Specialization, World history",15,Bloomington,Indiana,39.1637,-86.5257,United States
3880000063,"Huang, Bo","The Birth of Lamaism: Religious Institution, Ethnic Identity, and Politics Behind Tibetan-Rite Buddhism in Imperial China from the 11th-19th Century",Modern,"This dissertation explores the history of Tibetan-rite Buddhism in China, with a specific focus on how it was received, interpreted, organized, and reinvented by the people of China. Buddhism in Tibet already had its own monastic organization, rituals, scriptures, and meditation practices while forming a distinct religious tradition from Buddhism in the area we call China Proper today by the 11th century. When Tibetan monks entered “China Proper,” they had to deal with the pre-existing Chinese Buddhist establishment. It is generally assumed that Tibetan Buddhism from Tibet formed a very different system of religion which the Chinese and westerners called Lamaism that was institutionally and doctrinally separate from Chinese Buddhism. However, this research attempt to show how the institution of “Lamaism” as an identity separate from general Buddhism in China only started to form in the Ming dynasty and matured during the Qing. Furthermore, before the 20th century, many of the central tenets of Tibetan Buddhism still have not been translated into Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese usually did not have a clear understanding of the doctrinal difference between Lamaism and Chinese Buddhism. This led to many misunderstandings of what Lamaism was, giving rise to both positive and negative stereotypes, neither of which reflected the normative Tibetan Buddhist tradition in Tibet itself nor the western and modern Chinese understandings of the term Lamaism. I will explore the background of this process as well as the relationship between ethnic identity and religious identity throughout different dynasties; namely how affiliation to Lamaism could potentially affect the perceived ethnic identity of that practitioner.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,Indiana University,Central Eurasian Studies,Central Eurasian Studies,"Lamaism, Tibetan-rite Buddhism, China, 11th-19th century, Ethnic identity,",15,Bloomington,Indiana,39.1637,-86.5257,United States

Buddhists played an active role in the appropriation of science in China as they sought to relate their tradition to science in such a way that Buddhism would still have a place in the society of the modern Chinese state. In the course of these negotiations, Chinese Buddhists dealt with the most current advances in science. they discussed X-rays in the 1890s, the discovery that the Milky Way is not the only one in the universe in the 1920s, and they followed developments in the fields of Relativistic and quantum physics. Buddhists argued that while science was invaluable for the people of the world, scientific materialism was not. They cautioned about the ethical implications of certain aspects of science, such as the invention of new weapons and the theory of social Darwinism. In this dissertation, I show how Chinese Buddhists drew from their traditions of epistemology, psychology, and cosmology to highlight similarities between science and Buddhism, all while maintaining the superiority of Buddhism by identifying it as a “higher empiricism.” I trace the historical development of Chinese Buddhist discourses about something called “science,” by which I do not mean a body of knowledge or a set of practices, but an ideological entity that was identified by conflicting definitions and usages. I explicitly avoid the pitfalls inherent in adopting the popular “conflict thesis” for understanding the relationship between science and religion. I also avoid the opposite view, that of the “compatibility thesis,” which states that Buddhism is inherently compatible with science (especially when compared with Christianity). In analyzing the development of Buddhist discourses on science, I point out the areas of disagreements among them with regard to the proper use of science, as well as the extent to which Buddhists thought they could or should rely on science to prove the veracity of their doctrine.

304503708,"Luo, Chia-li",Coastal culture and religion in early China: A study through comparison with the central plain region,Ancient,"This dissertation identifies and introduces the culture of the coastal region in early China from the Neolithic through the early historic period, with a focus on its religious aspect. In analyzing the religious tradition of the coastal region, the author also compares it with that of contemporaneous central plains region, conventionally known as mainstream Chinese religion. The primary purpose of the dissertation is to challenge the conventional view of a homogenous early Chinese culture, explore the cultural and religious plurality of early China, and provide a more solid basis for discourses on the origins of Chinese religions. The first half of the dissertation includes a survey of related fields and an introduction to the recently identified coastal culture in early China. The survey covers the fields of the Wu-Yue culture, the Hundred Yue culture, and the Yi culture—all located within or linked with the coastal culture. It provides a summary of the archaeological research in the past few decades and a critical review of the common agendas of the fields. It is then followed by an introduction to the recent scholarship that establishes the identification of an early coastal culture, and a discussion of the physical features of the culture. The second half of the dissertation focuses on the religious aspect of the coastal culture, comparing it with that of the central plains culture. It includes two parts, the first part studies the cemetery layouts of both cultures, establishing the regionality of the central plains religious tradition (which is centered on lineage hierarchy and commonly considered as the “pan-Chinese” tradition) and the separate identity of the coastal religious culture. The second part aims to reconstruct the actual content of coastal religion, comparing it with an analysis of the religious paradigm of the central plains region. The dissertation concludes that the coastal religious tradition was fundamentally different from the central plains tradition, as shown in various aspects including the structure of the pantheon, the location of worship sites, and the views concerning the destiny of the dead and the relationship between the dead and the living.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Indiana University,NA,NA,"Religious history, Archaeology, History, Central plain, China, Coastal, Culture, Religion",15,Bloomington,Indiana,39.1637,-86.5257,United States

The dissertation takes the study of conversion beyond the traditional lineage framework and explores how narratives and rituals of national and imperial identity appropriate Buddhism. In addition, by focusing on the Buddhist conversion of the Mongols and their representation of it in relation to the multinational Qing (1636–1911), this work provides a clearer picture of Buddhism under Qing rule. Based on Qing-period sources, scholars have accepted that the Manchu emperors used the concepts of Buddhist imperial rule to incorporate the recently converted Mongols into the Qing empire. A recently discovered pre-Qing Mongolian history of Altan Khan and his conversion to Buddhism, which presents a new perspective on Mongol concepts of rule, Buddhist identity, and their relation to Mongol identity challenges this scholarly consensus. This source throws into sharp relief the transformations that ideas of Buddhism and the state underwent as boundaries of the community shifted. This dissertation provides an intellectual history of the Mongols' representation of identity formation through a critical edition of this early Mongol history. and on the basis of it, offers a re-interpretation of Buddhism in Qing period works. The first part investigates the changing cult of Genghis Khan, in relation to the Mongol nation and political rule. The second part explores the concept of the Qoyar Yosu (or dual custom of church and state), and the disjunctures it created between pre-Qing and Qing Buddhist identity in Mongolia. The final part explores how Mongol Buddhist identity developed during the 19th century into both trans-ethnic Buddhist Qing and local Mongol identities. This investigation of the Mongols' self-representation of their Buddhist national identity renders untenable previous concepts of the Mongol conversion and Qing rule.

This study sets out to present new ways of analyzing the creation of tradition, by examining three strategies of distinction by which traditions construct their identity: lineage construction, creative mythography and ritual systemization. The study begins with an examination of four inscriptions dating to the late second century, which reveal developments in communal cultic practice. I contend that it was within such social contexts that new ritual formulations led to the emergence of new types of religious practices, which came to be called Daoism. In the second chapter I demonstrate that the text was compiled during the late third century in the southern coastal region, that the redaction was impacted by several lineages, and that there were at least two distinct versions of the text in circulation until the fifth century. In the following chapters I explore the strategies of lineage construction, mythography and ritual systemization by which the compilers of the text distinguished their preferred practice from similar practices, thus creating a particular tradition. By uncovering the strategies by which Daoist lineages constructed mythical narratives and ritual practices this study sheds new light on the sources of Daoist religion, revealing hitherto unnoticed links between imperial ritual and mythology and Daoist practices, and provides a richer and more nuanced picture of the development of Daoist religion.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,Indiana University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, China, Creative mythography, Daoism, Five talismans of the numinous treasure, Lineage construction, Ritual systemization, Tradition",15,Bloomington,Indiana,39.1637,-86.5257,United States

Based on the field surveys made by the Chinese and Japanese investigators in the 1930s, this dissertation tries to correct the over-simplification of the Chinese peasant economy and describe how the peasants in Eastern Hebei made a living by a combination of agriculture, industry and commerce. By examining the ecosystem and calculating the grain production and consumption, it is found that the returns from farming were not even enough for the peasants own consumption. Eastern Hebei was a grain shortage area and the peasants there had to engage in non-farming activities to supplement their income and support their families. Besides engaging in traditional sideline production, the peasants in Eastern Hebei took the opportunities provided by the development of domestic and international trade and produced on a large scale for outside markets. The bristle processing in Fengrun county, paper making in Qian-an county and handicraft weaving in Baodi county are selected to show the importance of rural industry in the peasant economy in Eastern Hebei. This study also finds that in the modern period, either forced by survival pressure or attracted by outside opportunity, more and more peasants in Eastern Hebei left their villages and found temporary or permanent jobs in the outside world. The causes and consequences of the large scale emigrating--going to Manchuria--are discussed in detail to show the importance of non-farming income in the peasant economy. The 1930s witnessed increases in state taxation, the civil war, the Japanese invasion and the world economic depression. These developments are discussed in terms of impact upon the peasants of the villages under consideration. It is found that it was harder for the peasants to make a living in that period. In conclusion, this study supports Fei Xiaotong's argument that it was impossible for Chinese peasants to make a living on farming alone and the final solution for China's agrarian problem was diffused rural industrialization.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,Iowa State University,NA,NA,"History, Agricultural economics, Economic history, China",1,Ames,Iowa,42.0256,-93.6217,United States
304344699,"Mueggler, Erik A.",Specters of power: Ritual and politics in an Yi community,Contemporary,"This is an account of how people in a mountainous corner of Southwestern China received attempts of state officials to transform their identities as social persons. These were efforts to create both subjects of and agents for the socialist state. They aimed to make most people into willing material for campaigns to create new kinds of society, and to make many into agents who would actively carry out such campaigns. I show how these efforts were inextricable from moral transformations. They could not be separated from people's convictions of deep obligations to others, which bound the life and death of persons to the life and death of collectivities. The historical focus of this study is a ritual and political arrangement called a ts'ici, in the local Tibeto-burman language and a huotou (XXX) in Mandarin. In the ts'ici, the burden of dealing with representatives of Imperial and Republican states rotated yearly among the wealthiest households in the community. With this burden also rotated the duty of sponsoring a cycle of rituals intended to nourish the community's health and unity. Though this arrangement deteriorated rapidly after the area was liberated in 1950, to be finally destroyed early in 1965, it haunted the entire subsequent history of this community, as a group of powerful, malignant, and extremely stubborn ghosts. This investigation combines recollections of the ts'isi, its slow destruction, and the ghosts released in its demise with an exploration of the spatial foundations of social personhood. My aim is to show how memories, inextricable from the spaces people inhabited, became resources with which people deflected state efforts to manage how they lived and died, as persons, as households, and as a community.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, China",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States
304311850,"Cheng, Weikun","Nationalists, feminists, and petty urbanites: The changing image of women in early twentieth-century Beijing and Tianjin",Contemporary,"During the early twentieth-century (1902-14), women of the great north China cities of Beijing and Tianjin underwent dramatic changes in the nature of their lives. Encouraged both by an indigenous Chinese tradition of protesting patriarchal oppression and by Western feminism, they began systematically to violate Confucian moral restraints and cross existing gender boundaries. In contrast to previous scholarship, which has focused nearly exclusively on the Chinese women's movement led by elites in the south, this dissertation examines the changing image of northern urban women, both elite and commoner, through analyzing several interacting social groups: male reformers, feminist women, female students, and actresses. While each group possessed different attitudes toward women's issues, they jointly contributed to the transformation of women's political, economic, and social roles. In early twentieth-century north China, women did not initially strive to change their social position. They were inspired by male nationalist reformers who put forward a limited program of improving women's status. The lack of an independent economic foundation, and the constant threat of imperialist partition of China, prevented women from organizing an independent and united feminist movement. Early female activists were involved in a variety of moderate and pragmatic programs. Women's emancipation encompassed not only the struggle for political, economic, and educational rights, but also the demands for women's individual rights and Freedom at home. Especially after the Revolution on 1911, a shift of women's attitudes and lifestyles based on notions of individualism, consumerism, and iconoclasm coexisted with the suffrage movement. The demand for sexual equality was expressed by a range of rebellious conduct. Calls for emancipation were only slowly picked up by lower-class women. Much less organized or self-conscious, these women spontaneously revolted against the Confucian moral principles and men's control, integrating their efforts with the mainstream of the women's movement. In this study, women's resistance in different dimensions has been explored. In the private and family sphere, women began to break down the ideological and customary restraints on their social behavior, and sought to develop a self-centered and heterosocial lifestyle. In the public sphere, women's activities were more collective and feminist-oriented, crossing the boundaries between genders. With their active involvement in education, organization, journalism, and other political action, women became more conscious and informed regarding their submissive condition and the patriarchal oppression. Additionally, through participating in the broader nationalist movement, women developed a sense of citizenship and an ambition to have a voice in national affairs. Nationalist activities, though they sometimes proved contradictory to gender interests, promoted their collective solidarity, political awareness, and the image of female patriotism.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"Economic history, History, Womens studies, Cultural anthropology, China, images, twentieth century",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States
276107707,"Provost-Smith, Patrick","Macao, Manila, Mexico, and Madrid: Jesuit controversies over strategies for the Christianization of China (1580–1600)",Modern,"From Macao to Manila, Mexico, and Madrid, there were a number of contenders for missionary strategies to open the doors of the closed kingdoms of China. The strategies implicit to “accommodation,” historically attributed to Matteo Ricci (1554–1610), were among them. Yet, temporally coinciding with the formative years of the Jesuit mission to China were various Hispanic projects for the conquest of China. As the introduction of Christianity into the Americas and (more recently) the Philippine Islands, required prior pacification, and the establishment of a civil protectorate for missionaries and their fledgling converts, many argued that such would prove the case in China. A proposal for the conquest of China on those grounds came to be defended primarily by Alonso Sánchez (1545–1605), a Jesuit missionary in the Philippines, and chiefly disputed by José de Acosta (1540–1600), of missionary experience in Peru. The proposal launched a storm of controversy, and the arguments that followed attempted to articulate in various ways the problematic relationship of Christianization to the use of coercive civil, military, and religious authority—of “ evangelism ” to “ imperium .” What follows is an extended analysis of the central terms of that controversy: the arguments employed, the ways in which they were expressed, and the traditions of thought implied. It is argued that the controversy represented a historical moment in which events and circumstances provided the occasion for complex and long-standing controversies to coalesce. From St. Augustine's De civitate Dei , through the more recent wars of conquest in the Americas, the deeply problematic relationship of evangelism to empire proved a constant tension within Christian thought. The analysis undertaken here contextualizes the proposed conquest of China within the intellectual and theological milieu of the 1580's, complete with the tensions, contradictions, and uncertainties that marked Christian thought between the Renaissance and the 17 th century. Attempts are made to weigh and balance historiographical patterns of interpretation, and to draw from the moral and theological deliberations implied in the controversy critical insight into a chapter of the religious, moral and political thought of 16 th century Europe in its expanding global context.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"European history, Religious congregations, Religious history, History, China, Christianization, Jesuit, Sixteenth century",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States
304913835,"Sasaki-Gayle, Motoe","Entangled with empire: American women and the creation of the ‘New Woman’ in China, 1898–1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines how the (re)construction of America's national identity during a time of empire came to influence the subjectivity of American women working for America's civilizing mission overseas. From the beginning of the twentieth century, the new generation of college-educated American women moved beyond the domestic sphere and sought to become historical agents for modern progress by taking up missionary careers in education and sailing for the less advanced countries. Many of these women went to China—America's largest mission field in the early twentieth century—and established women's colleges, medical and nursing schools, and the YWCA for the purpose of creating “New Women” like themselves. In order to provide a raison d'etre for their projects, they forged identities as preachers of American civilization through dominant discourses in America relating to social evolution, American exceptionalism, science, liberal Christianity, and internationalism. By doing so, as this dissertation shows, their educational enterprises and their subjectivity were implicated in the project and ideology of American imperialism. Before setting sail, most of these American women thought that China was a virgin land awaiting their touch. Yet, they soon discovered that the concept and the term of the New Woman ( xin nüxing ) had already made its way onto Chinese soil. For non-Western countries like China, the New Woman was a significant element in the drive toward modernization and, by absorbing and vernacularizing Western knowledge and ideas, Chinese intellectuals, students, and revolutionaries sought to strengthen their country to thwart encroaching imperial powers. These attempts reflected the fact that China was trying to narrow the gap in level of civilization between the West and the non-West. As a result, discourses such as social Darwinism could be found on both sides of the Pacific Ocean so that both China and America began to change the ways they viewed and dealt with one another. Ultimately, the American women came to be criticized as imperialists and feudal masters and their projects came up against many obstacles. The dissertation shows that the American women's enterprises and subjectivity were contingent upon China's changing situation and that America's national identity was also interdependent with nations such as China.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"History, American history, Womens studies, Modern history, China, Empire, National identity, New Woman, The New Woman - America, China, Transnational history, U.S. imperialism, U.S.-China relations, United States-China, Women and education",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States
303991336,"Chia, Ning",The Li-fan Yuan in the early Ch'ing Dynasty,Modern,"The Li-fan Yuan was a central government agency of the Ch'ing dynasty (1644-1911) which dealt with Inner Asian affairs. This dissertation argues that it was not, as has usually been assumed, simply a diplomatic office intended to receive foreign dignitaries. Rather, as designed by the Manchu rulers, it was a large and complex agency, with its own field administration, intended to rule Inner Asian societies as fully internal components of the empire. As such, it brought about radical economic, social, and political changes throughout Inner Asia, and within China as well. Attempting to transcend the narrow political analyses in the field, this study discusses the multiple functions of the Li-fan Yuan and suggests that the interplay of those functions led the Manchus to succeed in incorporating the non-Chinese Mongols, Tibetans and Uighirs into the Great Ch'ing Empire. The administrative functions of the Li-fan Yuan brought the Inner Asian local leaders into the imperial bureaucracy, allowing direct political control by the Manchu court. The cultural functions of the Li-fan Yuan, in the ritual forms of Pilgrimage to the emperor, the Imperial Hunt, and the Tribute, created the symbolic relationship underlying Inner Asians' recognition of Ch'ing political authority. The Manchus' religious policy bridged the gap in spiritual life between Lamaist believers (the Tibetans and the Mongols) and the majority non-Lamaist believers of the Ch'ing empire. The Li-fan Yuan's work in Inner Asian language education created a professional translation class in the Ch'ing bureaucracy and promoted the cultural communication that an integrated multi-national empire needed. The economic functions of the Li-fan Yuan shielded the Inner Asian societies from the shortage of material necessities due to the fragile ecological environment, and tied the Inner Asian nomadic pastoral economy to the Chinese agricultural economy by expanding and routinizing exchange between the two sides. In discussing such important theoretical issues as the relation of nomadic and agrarian societies, the Chinese world order under an alien people like the Manchus, sinocentrism in the Ch'ing dynasty, and the understanding of the Great Wall frontier zone between Chinese and non-Chinese peoples, this study argues that under the Li-fan Yuan's management, the imperial government no longer played the passive role in Inner Asian affairs as it had in earlier Chinese dynasties, and the so-called barbarians in Inner Asia were never again viewed by the Chinese as people excluded from the Middle Kingdom.",1992,1992,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"History, History, China",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States

Chengdu was the capital city of Sichuan province and a fairly typical inland city, with a long historical and cultural tradition. Until the late Qing, it did not receive much impact from the West. This feature makes Chengdu as an object of study especially significant. This study seeks to answer: What happened to popular culture and public space in modern Chinese inland cities? What relationships pertained between urban elites and commoners, and how were these played out in regard to the use of public space? How did popular culture and local politics interact? By examining the street as a public space used by urban commoners as commercial space, recreational space, workplace, and ceremonial space, I explore the changes in street culture and the struggle among urban commoners, social reformers, and local authorities. Politics in Chengdu during this period experienced several stages, which I generalize those of “customary practice”, “reformist practice”, and “revolutionary practice”. Under the impact of political changes, although street culture retained considerable continuity, it also underwent important changes and developed new features in different political stages. Commoners were often regarded by elites as an unstable element of society. This situation inspired elites to consider the issue of social order, making the street a place they wanted to take over completely. At the same time, the commoners were also the people the social reformers wanted to utilize for achieving their own political purposes. Therefore, the streets were drawn into the orbit of local and national politics, and street culture was transformed into street politics. In this process, both commoners and reformers redefined their roles on the street. In the early twentieth century, social transformation brought about an important change in the use of the street. The streets were used by the commoners, no longer only for their livelihood and recreation, but now as well for organized political protest.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"History, Public administration, Cultural anthropology, Chengdu, China, Commoners, Local politics, Public space, Social reform, Street culture, Urban communities",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States

While the economic importance of riverine transportation during the Qing is well recognized, what is less understood is how the river transportation trade, by providing an alternative, mobile livelihood for the population excluded from China's dominant agrarian society, also played a significant role in the social, cultural and political life of numerous localities. I argue that the men and women who operated boats on the waterways in diverse localities throughout China, together with the local officials who sought to administer them, formed a diverse variety of “riverine communities.” These communities were constituted by the interconnected operation of distinctive forms of social life, commercial organization, religious practice, technological infrastructure and administrative policy. Each chapter explores a different aspect of Fujian's riverine community, paying special attention to how this community was impacted by a larger historical context of expanding population mobility, increasing occupational diversification and deepening concern among all levels of society over the preservation of livelihoods. Chapter Two considers the rugged riverine geography of Fujian and the long-term effort to develop transport routes through the province. Chapter Three analyzes the active role local officials took in governing Fujian's rivers as they negotiated the tension between a desire to maintain an agrarian-based, settled society linked to the land versus a determination to preserve all people's livelihoods, including those of China's growing mobile laboring population. Chapter Four considers boats as both “tools of the trade” and cultural symbols on the rivers. Chapters Five and Six explore various components of the work regimes of two different groups of river workers, the “bachelor sector” on the upper Min River, and the women of the Dan boat families who constituted the “familial sector” on the lower Min River. Chapter Seven analyzes the dispute that arose between Qing officials and British diplomats over the first introduction of steam boats on the Min by British traders, and Chapter Eight concludes this study with a discussion of a large-scale feud battle that erupted between sojourning boat workers and dock workers on the upper Min during the late nineteenth century. I argue that this conflict, which took officials more than six months to suppress, highlights how the atmosphere of tension and competition in the province by this time had an especially strong impact upon the region's large population of mobile workers.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"History, Transportation, Cultural anthropology, Economic history, China, Floating community, Min River, River transport, Society, State",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States

The tenement-ization of courtyard neighborhoods, the rise of various forms of affordable amusements, and runaway inflation during war and Japanese occupation combined to produce opportunities as well as dangers for women.

Individual accounts of desertions, pursuit of romantic relationships, and survival strategies under wartime economic pressure provide invaluable insights into the ways by which lower class women struggled to re-adjust individual choices in relation to the changing urban landscape. The first two chapters examine the formation and operation of women's social networks in courtyard tenements, and the ways they helped women engage in a rather fluid pattern of marriage. Chapters three and four study the link between the rise of affordable entertainment options in courtyard neighborhoods and commercial facilities on the one hand, and women's sexual agency in the process of their pursuit of personal pleasure on the other. The last two chapters study wifely desertion as a survival strategy, to argue that lower class women reconfigured customary roles of husband and wife in response to economic dislocations. Women's choices and strategies demonstrate that urban transformation penetrated the fabric of ordinary women's life. However, women did not merely respond to changes. they played an active part in reconfiguring urban space and redefining the socioeconomic structure. To do so, women did not rely upon institutionalized channels such as political participation or organized actions like labor strikes. Instead, they re-conceptualized the city through individualized survival strategies, through manipulations of pre-existing social practices and cultural preferences, and through their daily life choices. Women's adjustments to the dramatic changes in the urban landscape and their strategies of survival neither conformed to, nor posed a conscious challenge to, the official formulation of the meaning and function of the city. But their appropriations of urban transformations helped them to become an invisible force that left visible marks on the city's social and moral geographies.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, Beijing, China, Courtyard neighborhood, Japanese occupation, Law, Urban reform, Women",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States

Pierce","Buddhist medicine in medieval China: Disease, healing, and the body in crosscultural translation (second to eighth centuries C.E.)",Medieval,"This dissertation is a study of the role of literary and cultural translation in the transmission and reception of Buddhist medicine in medieval China between the second and eighth centuries. This dissertation brings to light the diversity of medical material in the Chinese Tripitaka, analyzes the central metaphors and discourses in this corpus, and examines how these foreign medical ideas were understood in their historical context. I employ methodologies from Translation Studies to reconcile the study of the transregional exchange of linguistic and cultural repertoires with the agency of individual historical authors as they retooled and adapted foreign knowledge to forward contemporary social strategies. I utilize this theoretical framework to analyze how Indian medical doctrines influenced Chinese Buddhist discourses and practices, while also emphasizing the importance of disease, healing, and the body as sites of crosscultural negotiation. Chapter 1 introduces the transmission of Buddhist medicine to China in the context of transregional currents of crosscultural religious and medical exchange. Chapter 2 outlines the theoretical approach of this dissertation, situating the translation of Buddhist medical doctrines within the context of indigenous Chinese cultural repertoires and the local religiomedical marketplace. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce the major metaphors at the foundation of Buddhist medical discourses, emphasizing the translation tactics and strategies mobilized in rendering these in the Chinese language. Chapter 5 focuses on the work of one sixth-century hagiographer, highlighting the role of healing narratives in the Buddhist proselytism. Chapter 6 looks at the strategies of cultural translation employed by authors of a range of indigenous Chinese Buddhist compositions between the sixth and eighth centuries, identifying connections between individual translators' treatments of Buddhist medicine and their social political, and personal contexts. A brief conclusion argues that a new approach prioritizing the role of translation in the dynamics of crosscultural exchange allows scholars to jettison the anachronistic categories of “religion” and “science” and move toward a greater appreciation of the integration of Buddhism and medicine in medieval China.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Medicine, Science history, Buddhism, China, Chinese religion, Healing, Medicine, Medieval, Translation",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States
305171281,"Hung, Ho-fung",Dynamics of popular contentions in mid-Qing China,Modern,"In the last three decades, a spate of research brought to light the dynamics of popular contentions in early modern Europe. These studies suggest that surges of commerce and centralized state power led to a transition of popular contentions from reactive to proactive claims, and from violent to non-violent repertories. This literature assumes that the Western path of development of contention is unique, and non-Western paths of development following the “impact of the West” and the disintegration of the premodern “oriental despotic” system are simply repetitions of the Western experience. This research is an attempt to examine the patterns of popular contentious in late imperial China (c. 1600–1900), with a focus on c. 1740–1840, a period when China's political economy was characterized by a commercialized economy, centralized state, and looming ecological crisis. Based on a catalog of contentious events derived from archival sources, I find that the changes in the patterns and dynamics of different types of contention (including political protest, class conflict, heterodox revolt and organized predatory activities) are functions of the particular trajectories of commercialization, state formation, and ecological degradation in mid-Qing China. They are comparable with but also distinctive from the patterns and dynamics of contention in contemporaneous Europe. In sum, political protest changed from predominantly proactive, peaceful actions in the early eighteenth century to reactive violence in the early nineteenth century. Class conflict changed from predominantly intra-communal conflicts between haves and have-nots in the early eighteenth century to actions that protect local communities' rights to subsistence against profit-making activities of the merchants in the early nineteenth century. Heterodox revolts and organized predatory activities were kept at bay by the strong imperial state, but were never rooted out in the eighteenth century. I argue that the modern revolutionary movement in twentieth-century China was a continuation and convergence of the traditions of political protest, heterodox revolts, and predatory activities in the mid-Qing period. This study shows that “modernization” of contentious politics in non-Western civilizations is rarely a simple repetition of the Western way, but is rather a complex hybridization of the Western influences and indigenous tracks of development.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,Johns Hopkins University,NA,NA,"Social structure, History, Political science, China, Commercialization, Popular contentions, Qing dynasty, State formation",10,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States

N.",Defending Christianity in China: The Jesuit defense of Christianity in the “Lettres édifiantes et curieuses” “Ruijianlu” in relation to the Yongzheng proscription of 1724,Contemporary,"Jesuits presented evidence in both French and Chinese to defend Christianity by citation of legal and historical precedents in favor of the “Teaching of the Lord of Heaven” (Catholicism) even after the Yongzheng Emperor’s 1724 imperial edict proscribed the religion as a heterodox cult. The Jesuits’ strategy is traceable to Matteo Ricci’s early missionary approach of accommodation to Chinese culture, which aimed to prove grounds for a Confucian-Christian synthesis based upon complementary points between Christian theology and their interpretation of Yuanru (Original Literati Teaching). Their synthesis involved both written and oral rhetorical techniques that ranged from attempts to show compatibility between different religious values, to the manipulation of texts, and to outright deceit. Personal witness, observation, and interpretation played a key role in Jesuit group translation projects. French and Chinese apologetic texts composed to prove grounds for the repeal of the 1724 proscription edict contain these approaches. The Lettres édifantes et curieuses écrite par des missionnaires jésuites (1702–1776) contain examples of this approach, as well as the Ruijianlu (1735–1737). Memorials in the Ruijianlu cited favorable legal precedents and imperial patronage rendered to Xiyangren (Men from the West). Jesuits presented their case for toleration of Christianity in the Ruijianlu in terms of Chinese notions of hospitality, diplomacy, and defense found in texts from as early as the Zhou dynasty. They cited an enduring Chinese defensive notion of “welcoming men from afar” ( rouyuanren ), but the court refused to return to this soft policy. The Qianlong Emperor rejected the Kangxi era policy of “welcoming men from afar” regarding established missions. In 1735 the imperial Board of Punishments re-enforced the proscription order against Christianity in military units and also ruled that baptism of abandoned infants by a Chinese convert constituted religious heterodoxy based on the Qing Code (Article 162). The twenty-one Jesuits (not expelled in 1724) remained in imperial service and at liberty to practice their religion among themselves. Officials pursued a severe policy of punishing any cult deemed heterodox according to statutes of the Code. Persecution of Christians increased throughout the eighteenth century, but abated during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor (1821–1851) when most anti-Christian edicts were rescinded and a subsequent imperial edict pardoned those Christians who practiced the faith for moral perfection.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Kansas State University,Department of History,History,"Religious history, History, European history, China, Christianity, Christianity in China, Jesuits, Law and diplomacy, Lettres edifiantes, Lettres edifiantes et curieuses, Qing dynasty, Qing history, Ruijian, Ruijianlu, Yongzheng proscription",2,Kansas City,Kansas,39.1235,-94.7443,United States

My study provides insight into the first series of prolonged diplomatic and cultural interactions between the United States and China during the inter-Opium War period. Combining the practices of diplomatic and cultural historians, I utilize the narratives and reports of travelers, merchants, diplomats, missionaries, and print journalists to show how a broad range of Americans relied on the same interconnected rhetorical tropes of mystery, opportunity, failure, threat, and success to justify the expansion of American influence in China. My work illuminates how Americans used these themes in contemporary debates regarding questions of political access, economic growth, religious influence, contemporary masculinity, and territorial expansion. China could represent whatever the observer wanted, and Americans from 1843 to 1856 used that indeterminacy to the greatest extent imaginable. Americans created an entire discourse of description that could simultaneously and effectively suit the needs of individuals, organizations, and the nation as a whole by cobbling together hopes, dreams, fears, and suspicions under the guise of engagement. Americans believed that increased access after the First Opium War would serve as a panacea for the problems that had previously hindered the Sino-American relationship. But instead of presenting a solution, greater engagement with China only served to open a Pandoras box, wherein the Chinese represented everything and anything that Americans could desire or fear, and it has not only motivated, but controlled the relationship ever since. The Sino-American relationship of the mid-nineteenth century represented the first major foray of the United States into diplomatic activity in Asia.

304130494,"Melancon, Glenn Paul","Palmerston, Parliament and Peking: The Melbourne Ministry and the Opium Crisis, 1835-1840",Contemporary,"Palmerston, Parliament and Peking is a revisionist work designed to challenge the prevailing economic interpretations of the first Opium War, 1839-1842. Orthodox historiography considers early nineteenth-century Britain as a modern, industrial society and argues that its Government needed to respond violently to the Chinese authorities' suppression of the opium trade in order to protect and expand a lucrative endeavor. Indian opium sales generated revenue for the British-run government in Bengal and paid for Chinese tea, a highly prized commodity in Great Britain. British industrialists demanded war to end the Chinese Government's restrictions on trade, known as the Canton system, thus opening China's market to goods produced by Britain's expanding industrial economy. During the mid-1970s a new interpretation of British society began to emerge which challenges the centrality of modernization to the experience of life in early nineteenth-century Britain. Viewing Britain in the 1830s as a predominantly traditional society, these historians argue that the landed aristocracy remained the dominant order economically, socially and politically. Although Northern industrialists launched their challenge to this aristocratic order in this period, the limited scope of industrial growth inhibited their ability to win approval for middle-class initiatives at the highest levels of government. By revising the interpretation of the British Cabinet's decision to wage war on China, this dissertation supports these new interpretations of early nineteenth-century British society. Lord Melbourne's Whig Ministry (1835-1841) did not respond immediately to calls for a violent response to events in China. Several Ministers doubted the wisdom of confronting such a populous empire as China, and economic considerations shared center stage with the Government's domestic political interests. A political crisis in the Fall of 1839 created the opportunity for middle-class Radicals, whose constituent eagerly awaited the opening of China, to sway a cautious aristocratic government.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,Louisiana State University and Agricultural & Mechanical College,NA,NA,"Modern history, European history, China, Great Britain, Melbourne, William, Opium War, Palmerston, Henry",1,Baton Rouge,Louisiana,30.442,-91.1311,United States

Rockefeller Jr. and the Architecture of an American Internationalism (1919-1939).,Contemporary,"Following the First World War, American philanthropist and heir to the Standard Oil fortune, John D. Rockefeller Jr., financed an international body of cultural and scientific institutions, which he presented as sites of global """"""""brotherhood,"""""""" intellectual cooperation, and shared world heritage. Combining religious history with an architectural and urban-spatial analysis of the built environments associated with these institutions, this dissertation argues that Rockefeller's putatively secular and inclusive promotion of culture and science was, in fact, designed to arrest the rise of """"""""savage"""""""" nationalisms and a """"""""godless"""""""" communism. While scholars have recognized the imperialism inherent in Rockefeller's philanthropy, they have largely ignored its theopolitical dimensions and its unexpected instrumentalization of secular buildings and landscapes towards religious concerns. Focusing on the so-called Orient (which valued modernity, sought freedom from European powers, and understood Western Christianity as an accomplice to imperialism), Rockefeller, a devout capitalist and Baptist, underwrote projects reconciling Christianity with modernity. Simultaneously, he presented Protestant America as a new civilizational leader to diverse audiences, including nationalists in the former Ottoman territories abroad and students from China and other modernizing nations studying in the U.S. Concentrating on two groups of buildings from his larger patronage---the International Student Houses and the museums and archaeological expedition-houses of the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute---I show how Rockefeller leveraged architecture to present an American internationalism and its scientific and religious modernity as a """"""""logical"""""""" fit for diverse regions and conditions. From the Pacific Coast to the Middle East, his team of architects, theologians, archaeologists, and social reformers attempted to harmonize each of their buildings within its immediate geopolitical and aesthetic site.

The modern fiscal state greatly enhanced state capacity and stimulated financial development. it thus represented a crucial stage in the transformation from early modern to modern state and economy. My comparative analysis of England, Japan, and China shows multiple sequences and outcomes. All three cases had well-established early modern states and sophisticated market economies. Under the pressure of increasing spending demands, state actors conducted similar experiments, such as short-term borrowing, issuing of paper notes, and the collection of taxes upon domestic consumption. England became a modem fiscal state by the 1750s when its government used the revenues from excises and the customs to service its massive long-term debt. Japan made the leap in the late 1880s when tax revenues were employed to back up paper money, i.e., banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan. China, however, failed to develop into a modem fiscal state. I put forward a temporally-based causal mechanism which resulted from the interactions between a profound state credit crisis and socio-economic conditions. Such credit crises were caused by excessive dependence upon fictitious credit instruments such as bills of short-term borrowing unfunded by tax revenue in England or non-convertible paper notes in Japan. As these credit crises were an unintended consequence of earlier policies or events, they were exogenous to subsequent institutional development. As a problem that had to be solved, they forced experimentation, selected effective institutional arrangements and competent financial officials, and facilitated a continuous learning and accumulation of effective elements in a process full of uncertainties. Socio-economic conditions, such as the size of consumption and the degree of concentration of production, were important to sustain this process in which various elements came to form a mutually reinforcing system. The lack of such an interactive process is used to explain the absence of a modern fiscal state in China. This institutional model reconciles the uncertainties and multiplicity of possible outcomes in the early stages of the process and the eventual observed outcome. This dissertation contributes to the study of institutional dynamics, which aims to understand how specific institutions emerge and consolidate.

923618709,"Matsuzaki, Reo",Institutions by Imposition Colonial Lessons for Contemporary State-building,Contemporary,"What explains variation in institution-building under foreign occupations? Why do some state-building missions produce effective and durable state institutions, while others leave a legacy of weak or dysfunctional ones? I explored these questions through a comparative study of the Japanese colonization of Taiwan (1895–1945) and the American colonization of the Philippines (1898–1941), which produced contrasting institutional legacies despite the presence of similar initial conditions. While a strong bureaucratic Taiwanese state arose in the aftermath of Japanese colonization, the legacy of the American occupation of the Philippines was a weak postcolonial state penetrated by parochial interests. I explain variation in institution-building outcomes through two causal variables: (i) the degree of discretionary power afforded to the occupational administration by the home government. and (ii) the ability of native elites to effectively resist the institution-building effort. Discretionary power allows reform agents to abandon any pre-formulated (and likely ill-conceived) plans, and instead flexibly integrate native laws, norms, and customs with their new institutional designs. Additionally, and contrary to conventional wisdom, more effective institutions emerge when native elites possess the willingness and capacity to resist (even violently) the institution-building effort of foreign agents. The reformist state-building agenda of occupiers is likely to be in direct opposition to the distributional interests of native elites, who seek to maintain their advantageous position within the existing order. It is, therefore, only under the threat of effective resistance that foreign agents will accommodate the interests of native elites to forge institutions with local ownership. The main empirical chapters of the dissertation draw on more than two years of original archival research in fourteen libraries and depositories across Japan, Taiwan, and the United States. In both cases, my analysis focused on the similarities and differences in the process through which education and police institutions were developed over time. these two areas were chosen due their importance for a country's political stability and socioeconomic development. The applicability of conclusions drawn from the historical cases to contemporary state-building missions was assessed through an examination of recent U.S. efforts at building a police institution in Afghanistan.

Drawing on three years of transnational archival research spanning Vietnam, China and Singapore in a variety of Vietnamese, Chinese, French, and English sources, I construct the first comprehensive social and political history of Chinese commercial networks, social organizations, and cultural institutions; their multi-level interactions with the French colonial regime and Vietnamese; and their relations to mobile communities in maritime Southeast Asia and a China in the middle of drastic political transformations. Focusing on four crucial sites of ethnic Chinese-colonial state interactions, notably the colonial rice trade, health and cultural institutions, immigration surveillance, and crime and informal economies, my dissertation resituates the Chinese in Vietnam at the center of a prominent Nanyang diasporic network connecting East and Southeast Asia by examining Chinese transnationalism and identities as evolving and flexible articulations that responded dialogically to French colonial control, to the gravity of the Chinese Revolution and nationalist movements, and to varying modes of interactions with the wider Chinese capital and migratory connections in Hong Kong and Singapore. The dissertation is organized into four main chapters, thematically and chronologically organized to highlight the evolution of Chinese identities, mobile practices, and relationships to colonialism against dominant narratives of modern Vietnamese history that tend to privilege revolutionary times and downplay inter-ethnic elements. Chapter 1 explores Chinese rice monopoly and the political struggles between transnational rice merchants, a hyper-regulatory colonial state, and a new generation of Francophile Vietnamese politicians who advocated anti-Chinese nationalism as the answer to Chinese “domination.” Chapter 2 focuses on Chinese participation in the global opium trade, gambling cercles, and inter-Asian relationships that fostered an informal economy while challenging the foundation of colonial legal structures, leading to Vietnamese contentious attitudes towards Chinese roles in the French civilizing mission. Chapter 3 investigates the establishment, bureaucratization, and innovation of the French service of immigration control seeking to police increasingly mobile Chinese economic, social, and “illicit” networks and Chinese deployment of flexible identities to resist colonial hegemonic regulations. And chapter 4 turns to examine the local and transnational tensions of ethnic co-existence between mobile Chinese communities and the colonial state as reflected in issues of Franco-Chinese education, repatriations of Chinese remains to Hong Kong and their hometowns, and Chinese-led hospitals and their interactions with colonial medical institutions. My dissertation advances four interrelated areas of studies: Chinese migrants in Vietnam in the history of Nanyang Chinese migration wherein Vietnam’s crucial Chinese communities have remained largely marginal; the studies of the Sinosphere and Chinese identities; Sino-European relations and postcolonialism; and the history of colonial and modern Vietnam at large.

Three periods of its recent history are examined: the pre-1949 period. the collective period between 1950 and 1983. and the post-1984 period. In each period, I examined the power relationship between elites and commoners. In the pre-1949 period, the Yangzi delta had a high tenancy rate. Scholars often assume landlords, because they control the means of production, have the ability to control tenants. In Shuitou, however, land ownership was dispersed, landlords had little contact with tenants, and landlords could not evict tenants. In fact, the landlords were often were threatened by tenants' demands for rent reduction. Similarly, some argue that, in the 1950 to 1983 period, cadres could control production team members because of control of the means of production. In Shuitou, however, because of the rigid system of distribution set by the state, production team cadres not only could not selectively favor certain peasants, but they were often deposed from their positions by the disaffected peasants. Finally, in the post-collective 1990s, economic stratification in Shuitou did not give the wealthy entrepreneurial factory owners a commanding position over factory workers because villagers could easily find jobs in the forty button factories in Shuitou. Thus, in each of the three periods in Shuitou's history, the elites did not and could not control the village commoners. Power in this study is defined as the ability to punish and reward. Based on this definition, my study considers two forms of power structures: power-dispersed and power-concentrated. In the former, structural constraints prevent elites from punishing and rewarding commoners. In the latter, elites punish and reward commoners at will. The inability of elites to control commoners in Shuitou is explained in terms of its power-dispersed structure. Although Shuitou exhibited a power-dispersed structure through all three periods, this does not preclude the likelihood that other Chinese communities in comparable periods have had power-concentrated structures. By analyzing communities in terms of the two forms of power structure, this study provides a typology of community and a framework for comparison in Chinese society.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,Michigan State University,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, China, Yangtze Delta",8,East Lansing,Michigan,42.748,-84.4836,United States
304127128,"Wang, Guanhua",The 1905 anti-American boycott: A social and cultural reassessment,Contemporary,"The 1905 anti-American boycott was a new type of popular movement. This study argues that the movement was the result of long-term, accumulative, and multi-facet developments in urban political culture which directly led to urban political activism in the form of urban nationalism. Significant developments in early twentieth century China included commercialization of mass communication, rise of urban entertainment, and politicization of new urban social groups. It was in these long-term accumulative developments not in a few shocking effects of military defeats and other national humiliations that this author tries to find the roots of Chinese urban nationalism. In the early twentieth century, Chinese-exclusion acts by the United States provided a perfect issue for Chinese urbanites to express themselves politically. The exclusion acts seemed to be unjust and at odds with both Western ideals and Confucian humanism which banned all and only Chinese immigrants. The fact that the Qing government was too weak to obtain equal rights for its people provided an opportunity for the urbanites to show their strength. To do so they decided to boycott American goods. As a means, the boycott seemed to be perfect because it was peaceful and by the people. The boycott might have been more effective and successful if big merchants had not betrayed the movement half-way through. The eventual failure of the boycott exposed the difficulty of the sovereign status boycotters assigned to the public (gong) vis-a-vis the private and official spheres. Merchants wanted to assert their rights as individuals to trade freely with whoever they wished. The Qing government stepped in to protect this claim as a sovereign government would do. In the final analysis, although we can see from the 1905 boycott elements of an emerging public sphere in China, there was a long way for the Chinese people to go in order to build a mutual civic society.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,Michigan State University,NA,NA,"History, American history, China, Qing dynasty",8,East Lansing,Michigan,42.748,-84.4836,United States
304118729,"Shao, Qin","Making political culture: The case of Nantong, 1894-1930",Contemporary,"Previous scholarship on state-society relationships in China in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has chiefly focused on social and institutional changes, and has often failed to appreciate fully either the multifaceted process through which local elites legitimated their authority or the enduring impact which the local self-government movement had on the history of modern China. This dissertation adopts a mainly cultural approach to examine local self-government experience. Focusing on Nantong, a county in central China, and on the period from 1894 to 1930, this study explores the processes and methods involved in the making of a locally-centered political culture. This study finds that although local self-government institutions were important to the establishment of elite power, the local political culture, which included new concepts, new symbols, new political instruments, and new rhetorical assumptions, was nevertheless essential in creating the image of elite authority at the expense of state power. The Nantong elite not only successfully developed a locally-oriented political, economic, and cultural system, but also constantly searched for and invented new symbols and methods of publicity to shape and reinforce the rhetorical assumption that a purely self-governing county under the leadership of local elite could be and had been achieved regardless of the outside political situation. This political culture refashioned local politics, which was no longer practiced merely through vertical administrative lines but was redefined by social networks, mass media, spatial rearrangement, celebrity visitors, and many other new means. More importantly, the political culture, once formulated, became an ongoing force independent of institutional change and had enduring impact on subsequent history.

(Volumes I and II)",Contemporary,"This comprehensive study of the activities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in China's Fujian Province between 1924-1934 uses newly-published contemporary documents to challenge some previous assessments of the socio-economic background of the Chinese Revolution and assumptions about the effectiveness of the CCP's politico-military methods. Previous works have suggested that the CCP used some combination of ideological appeals, organizational skill and/or the prospect of fundamental socioeconomic reforms to recruit masses of discontented Chinese peasants to their cause. Party historians and Western scholars have also generally agreed that the rural base-building strategy whose origins are attributed to Mao Zedong played a significant role in the long-term success of the revolutionary movement. This study suggests that these explanations for revolutionary success need reevaluation and modification. The pre-revolutionary Fujian rural economy was not sharply declining. some important sectors may actually have been expanding. Moreover, many aspects of the revolutionary movement were not entirely new, but rather represented continuations and/or reworkings or established patterns of collective action, rural militarization and intra-elite conflict. Also, Fujian peasants were far from being dependable CCP allies. divergence between the perceived interests of both sides meant that the CCP-peasant relationship was as confrontational as it was cooperative, and that the CCP's much-celebrated organizational mobilization was much less effective than hitherto believed. In addition to these problems, the Maoist base-building strategy was undercut by the incompatibility of various demands and interests of local and regional/central authorities.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,Michigan State University,NA,NA,"History, China",8,East Lansing,Michigan,42.748,-84.4836,United States
305600434,"Wang, Shuo","Manchu women in transition: Gender, ethnicity, and acculturation in the 17th –18th century China",Modern,"This dissertation is about gender and ethnicity in Qing dynasty—the last dynasty in Chinese history, established by the Manchus, a non-Chinese ethnic group in northeast China. Over the years, scholars of Chinese history dispute against each other about whether the Manchus became Chinese after they entered China Proper. This study supports the arguments that the Manchus maintained their ethnic identities until the end of the dynasty. The Manchu culture was not assimilated by Chinese although it differed from the traditional culture of Manchuria as the result of acculturation. This study departs from the existing scholarships by examining the acculturation from a new perspective—the interaction of gender and ethnicity. It discusses the roles the Manchu women played in the construction of Manchu ethnicity and the way in which their participation was different from that of men in the process of acculturation. The conclusion is that women changed more slowly and more superficially than men. When Manchu men gradually accepted many Chinese Confucian values, women still lived in an old Manchu way and thus helped many traditions to pass on. This dissertation is heavily based on Qing archival materials, housed in the First Historical Archive Museum in Beijing and in the Academia Sinica in Taipei. These primary sources provide previously unknown information about Manchu women's lives and experience after the conquest. Some primary sources from literature and interviews are also used as supplementary materials in the dissertation. This study has five chapters, plus an introduction part and a conclusion. The topics it discusses include Manchu women's roles and positions in family, widowhood and remarriage. intermarriage between the Manchus and Chinese. and gender relations and sexuality.

As the opposition parties were established and the elections became competitive, the electorates had chances to formulate their party identification to deal with the complexity of politics in Taiwan. However, as discussed in this study, second-generations voters were more likely than voters in the other two generations to have stable partisan preference, and they employed their partisan preferences to determine their national identity. Therefore, second-generation voters might formulate their party identification and employ that identification to determine their political attitudes.

304258830,"Chafy, Carl Randall",Technology and education in the Third World: The pervasion of the culture of progress,Contemporary,"Contemporary literature concerning technology and education in the third world is dominated by development-based approaches advocating the fastest route to third-world modernization. Thus, the primary consideration in the bulk of third-world development literature, from both Western and third-world perspectives, is catching up to the West. To achieve this goal, technology and education are characterized as tools for development, disconnected from the social and historical roots of the Enlightenment vision of progress (the foundation for our current understanding of technological progress). Although some Western theoretical and historical literature has considered the impacts of Western culture and technology on third-world cultures, little has been written about the role of progress as an ideology in third-world social formations. To explain how ideas about progress have a tangible social impact, this text considers theories of ideology and the assertion that technological, or Western, progress as a dominant ideology has become persuasive on a global scale. Using both a theoretical and historical approach, this text investigates the problematic and historically constituted link between technology, education, and progress in a third-world context, and scrutinizes the dehumanizing potential of using technological progress as a gauge for civilizational advancement. We can find evidence of the pervasion of progress by examining the history of colonial interactions between the West and the non-West, the rise of technical education in the West (and ultimately the third world), and the historical and contemporary experience of China, the world's largest third-world country. Colonial interactions between the West and the non-West established the strength of Western technology and ultimately third-world cultural inferiority. Subsequently, third-world education, inheriting the Western educational tradition, has strongly embraced practical forms of education to accelerate the process of catching up to this advanced culture. Both of these phenomena are clearly exemplified in the case of China, which has sought, since its first experiences with the West in the colonial era, to accelerate modernization through the development of Western technology and the use of practical forms of education (in the context of its own cultural development).",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Michigan Technological University,NA,NA,"History, Science history, Educational software, China, modernization",1,Houghton,Michigan,47.1118,-88.5675,United States

Led by President Chiang Kai-shek and his ruling Kuomintang Party, the ROC received military, financial, and humanitarian assistance from the U.S., and enjoyed support in the White House, from the Departments of State and Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Democratic and Republican Parties. President Chiang even employed public relations firms and political pressure groups to help generate public support and to sway American policymakers to favor his cause. By the end of the 1970s, however, the ROC had lost its seat in the United Nations and no longer maintained formal diplomatic relations with the United States. Why would the United States abandon a long-standing World War II ally, recipient of American aid, and fellow anti-communist? The 1960s proved to be a pivotal decade in the diplomatic and military relationship between the United States and the ROC. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, both Democrats, publicly promised support for Chiang and the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan. Chiang hoped to secure continued military aid and diplomatic support by relying upon allies in the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, and in the U.S. Congress, and even occasionally making threats to take actions detrimental to American policy. Throughout the 1960s, the U.S.-ROC relationship was tested by events in the United Nations, the Taiwan Strait, and Southeast Asia. By the end of the decade, the ROC had lost millions in American aid and the United States had publicly started to consider normalizing relations with the People's Republic of China. This dissertation will show that U.S.-ROC relations in the 1960s deteriorated due to a combination of factors. The Vietnam War was one of several factors that helped bring an end to formal American relations with the Republic of China. The Vietnam War caused a conflict of interest, whereby American containment of communism in Southeast Asia clashed with ROC plans to maintain its international legitimacy and to restore its rule over all China. Additionally, bureaucratic changes within the State Department, the demise and ineffectiveness of the China Lobby, and the changing make-up of the United Nations resulting from decolonization also contributed to the decline of U.S.-ROC relations.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,Mississippi State University,NA,NA,"American history, History, International law, International relations, China, Diplomatic relations, Military relations, Taiwan, Vietnam War",1,Starkville,Mississipi,33.45441314606764,-88.79410573135954,United States

In the nineteenth century, the rise of Western imperialism threatened the survivals of all three realms. Unlike their East Asian neighbors, Japan, China, and Siam preserved a large measure of self-rule though they had to cede significant amounts of sovereignty. To defend their societies' interests, their leaders sought to modernize their political, social, and economic structures. In the process, they abandoned existing educational systems in favor of Western models and practices. The purpose of this comparative study was to better understand the motivations, methods, and results of their educational modernizations by examining their educational development from the seventeenth to the mid-twentieth century. The study answered four main questions: (1)&#xa0.What motivated these societies to modernize their educational systems using Western models and practices? (2)&#xa0.How did they accomplish their educational modernizations? (3)&#xa0.How did they adapt Western models to suit their political, social, economic, and cultural circumstances? (4)&#xa0.What were the broad results of their educational modernizations? Although the inquiry heavily relies on English secondary sources, some primary-source and Japanese materials were considered. The analysis employed such recognized qualitative/historical methods as constant comparison, triangulation, negative case analysis, and internal criticism. The study found that the Japanese, Chinese, and Siamese made the adoption of European and American educational approaches a central component of their modernization strategies. While employing similar borrowing methods, namely textual study, foreign experts, study abroad, and external help, they incrementally rebuilt their educational systems through trial and error experimentation. In adapting Western models, all three added elements of their traditional ideologies. Although each nation recovered their full sovereignty, the political, social, and economic consequences of their educational modernizations differed. Nonetheless, educational reform was uniformly a catalyst for far-reaching change. Ultimately, their eclectic borrowing and shrewd adaption of foreign ideas and practices allowed the Japanese, Chinese, and Thais to create their own versions of modernity.

This political process can be regarded as two mechanisms entwined together. that is, Taiwanization and democratization and both escalated into the constitutional politics in the seven constitutional revisions. This dissertation attempts to explore these dynamic relations among conflicting national identities, democracy and constitutional politics. I will analyze how the fatung embedded ROC Constitution was transformed into a Taiwan-centered ROC Constitution, why this transformation was possible, and why some constitutional issues emerged and became essential in certain junctures of political struggles. I assert that the nature of conflicting national identities provides a better, more thorough explanation for understanding the constitutional revision process and its politics in the time of democratic transition in Taiwan. Second, I will trace the development and dynamic between Taiwanization and democratization and assert that the democratizing process in Taiwan in the early stage was driven by the rise of Taiwanese consciousness and Taiwanese nationalist sentiment and however, as the democracy formally established in the late 1990s, a new democratic force has arisen—one which provides different political rhetoric from the past and which further cultivates the deepening of Taiwan's democracy. In other words, as I have discovered in the seventh constitutional revision, the identity-driven identity politics, or Taiwanization, having once brought democracy to Taiwan, had somehow lost its progressiveness, and yet nevertheless, the newly emerging, more democratic and less identity-driven forces, joined together to become the political protagonist leading Taiwan to advance to a new level of democracy.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,The New School,NA,NA,"History, Political science, Social structure, China, Constitution, Constitution of the Republic of China, Constitutional change, Democratization, National identity, Taiwan, Taiwanization",1,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

275880985,"Wue, Roberta May-Hwa",Making the artist: Ren Bonian (1840–1895) and portraits of the Shanghai art world,Contemporary,"The leading painter in nineteenth-century Shanghai, Ren Bonian (1840–1895) was known for his tour-de-force technique, as well as the remarkable range of subjects he painted. His portraiture, however, occupies a special place in his oeuvre. In high demand but difficult to obtain, these works by Ren focused almost exclusively on denizens of the Shanghai art world. Though much admired, little research has been done on this unprecedented series of images of fellow painters, calligraphers, dealers and collectors. By employing the portraits as documents, and also by using contemporary primary sources such as guidebooks, newspapers, magazines and collected writings by the sitters themselves, this dissertation casts light on Shanghai's little-understood art world, specifically in its social and economic contexts. Thus, this dissertation not only examines Ren Bonian's portraiture practices and strategies, it is also a study of the artist and the art world that engendered these portraits. The dissertation begins with a double portrait of the artist himself. A major obstacle in approaching Ren Bonian is the large number of anecdotes and stories surrounding the artist since his death in 1895. While these largely fictive tales complicate a straightforward biography, they are valuable for understanding changing attitudes towards and assumptions about Ren Bonian. These stories are contrasted with an account of the artist's early career as told through the numerous portraits dating from this period, and with the young artist's rising reputation as documented in contemporary Shanghai guidebooks and magazines. The critical setting of Shanghai is given wider scope in a study focusing on art world business practices and activities using advertisements and articles from the famous Shanghai newspaper, Shenbao . These documents make the increasing professionalization of the artist especially clear, a necessity in Shanghai's marketplace society. The final section of the dissertation looks at Ren Bonian's portraiture as a social practice, both in terms of analyzing Ren's social characterization of his sitters as latter-day literati and in terms of the uses of the portraits as tools of social interaction and identity.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Artist, China, Painting, Portraits, Ren Bonian, Shanghai",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304363469,"Chou, Fang-mei",The life and art of Wen Boren (1502-1575),Modern,"This study explores the life and art of Wen Boren (1502-1575), a painter from the city of Suzhou, a leading cultural center of China. The first chapter investigates the artist's life and delineates his artistic development. Wen Boren grew up in the shadow of his immensely famous uncle, the scholar-artist Wen Zhengming (1470-1559), one of the so-called four great Ming artists. He received a full classical education in preparation for the civil service examination, but subsequently he started to market his formidable painting skills in the Wen tradition. He was welcomed by patrons outside Suzhou and lived for an extended period in Nanjing. Some art critics disliked the fact that he, as a literatus and leading upholder of the Wen tradition, was openly profiting from selling his paintings, and their criticisms effectively diminished Wen Boren's actual position in art history. This chapter concludes that the artist was, however, responsible for introducing the painting styles developed by the Wu School artists to a broader geographical area. The next three chapters examine Wen Boren's works in terms of his contributions to painting genres popular in sixteenth-century Suzhou. The second chapter focuses on three topographical albums. These albums illustrate how the promotion of local culture, enthusiasm for travel, and literati antiquarian interest converge. One of the albums also sheds light on the interrelationship between patrons and the scholars they sponsored. The third chapter discusses biehaotu (sobriquet landscapes), a genre in which the artist illustrated a patron's sobriquet through landscape. The examples discussed here demonstrate that whenever patrons approached Wen Boren for a biehaotu, they expected something similar to what Wen Zhengming would have done. The biehaotu also strongly expresses the idea of being a recluse in the city, an image that patrons sought to cultivate. The last chapter examines Wen Boren's paintings with Daoist themes. Wen's understanding of the Daoist classics enhanced the complexity of his compositions, and his innovations in this regard were taken up by later artists.

305463574,"Nemroff, Lauren S.",The figure paintings of Tang Yin (1470–1524),Modern,"The Chinese artist Tang Yin (1470–1524), canonized as one of the “Four Masters of the Ming” ( Ming si jia ), was a premier practitioner of figure painting ( renwu hua ). Both within and beyond the walls of his native Suzhou, he was also a celebrated belle-lettrist and personality who appealed to a broad segment of urban society. Tang produced a diverse pictorial repertoire that was to profoundly influence the history of Chinese painting. His images of historical and legendary figures, courtesans, and contemporary scholars reveal the vibrancy, refinement, attitudes, and values of mid-Ming society. Although Tang's figure painting constitutes a critical component of his work, past scholarship has primarily focused on his landscape paintings thus rendering our understanding of his artistic aims and practices incomplete. Recent research posits a connection between Tang's famously bohemian life and choice of pictorial subjects, but insufficiently probes the dynamic interplay between his painting and Suzhou's flourishing urban culture. Using a diverse body of visual and textual evidence, I identify important themes in Tang's figure painting. Chapter one examines Tang's copies of the canonical Night Banquet of Han Xizai theme. I assess the significance of his insertion of costly furnishings, screen paintings, textiles and other collectible objects in the depicted scenes. I situate these compositional elements in terms of Suzhou's status as the Ming center for silk weaving and handicraft production, and its local market for luxury goods. Chapter two explores Tang's representations of scholar-beggars, libertines and other figures drawn from popular dramas and fiction. These subjects, like his better-known “beauties” ( meiren ) paintings discussed in chapter three, indicate the broader impact of the entertainment world on the artist's picture-making practices. My reading of the inscriptions on these paintings indicates that Tang strategically used his subjects to define a public persona based upon established cultural icons and urban social archetypes. I argue that his figural production constitutes a critical and a highly self-reflexive response to the contingencies of Suzhou's political, socio-economic, and cultural conditions. These arguments are extended in the final chapter's discussion of Tang's portraits of historical worthies and contemporary “lofty scholars” ( gaoshi ).",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,NA,NA,"Art history, History, China, Figure paintings, Ming dynasty, Tang Yin",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304513993,"Lewis, Candace Jenks",Pottery towers of Han dynasty China,Ancient,"Some of the most remarkable burial objects ( mingqi ) from early Chinese tombs are the tall pottery towers ( taolou ) created during the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.). In the prevailing view, these pottery towers, along with other architectural mingqi , have been considered a critical source of information about the architecture of the Han period. While there is truth in this view, a significantly different interpretation of the architectural burial objects emerges from this comprehensive analysis. This dissertation presents a history of scientifically-excavated pottery towers and examines the complex and, sometimes, ambiguous meanings of the towers in relation to Han culture—its artisans, patrons, and religion. The study has established that pottery towers were made from the end of the Western Han (first century B.C.E.), attaining greatest popularity during the turbulent years of the late Eastern Han (second century C.E.), and continuing for several decades into the third century C.E. A total of 119 towers of the Han and immediate post-Han periods have been identified and categorized by regional styles. Artisans who made the pottery towers were anonymous craftsmen—working in local workshops away from the sphere of influence of the court, but utilizing the court factory techniques of mass production and modular construction. The patrons of the Western Han period came from a small corps of the middle levels of the élite, and during the Eastern Han from a very large segment of the nation's élite. By the Eastern Han dynasty (first and second centuries C.E.) this group included high-level bureaucrats, landowners, merchants, the military, and even one royal prince. In the interaction of artisans and patrons, local traditions, not centrally-controlled court traditions, largely determined the design of the works. Accordingly, the iconography of the pottery towers can be identified as non-scholastic in origin, with two main subjects—the mingtang (Bright Hall, a traditional ritual structure with cosmological significance) and the taicang (Great Granary, a building symbolizing food and wealth). Both have. been characterized as popular utopian visions, expressing hopes for a bountiful and harmonious existence in the afterlife.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Cultural anthropology, Architecture, Burial objects, China, Han dynasty, Pottery towers",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
304361507,"Rowan, Diana Pyle",Portable Buddhist shrines of the T'ang period,Medieval,"This dissertation concerns small shrines made for Buddhist worship during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Because they were intended for personal devotions, these diminutive sculptures were created as portable works of art. Without a specific temple site it is difficult to establish provenance, a condition that has determined the methodology used in this study. that is, each of the three shrines considered is evaluated for style and iconography, and related to an appropriate cultural context and textual evidence. The first shrine studied is an ivory diptych found in Gansu, China. By reference to similar stone diptychs of northwestern India, stylistic and iconographic analyses, and textual evidence the work is defined as a late seventh-early eighth century private commission from the Kasmiri region. The second shrine is a wooden triptych now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum, Kansas City, Missouri. The work's style and iconography, evidence of a Khotanese-Tibetan-Chinese cultural context, and the Eight Bodhisattva cult with its cosmic relation to consecration rites identify the mandala as a late eighth-early ninth century ritual object of northeastern Tibet or Dunhuang during the period of Tibetan occupation (787-848). The third shrine, unlike the previous two, is not unique. the wooden triptych belonging to the Inui Family in Japan is compared to four other related works in Japan and Korea. The small Inui triptych is placed in the context of imported devotional art works or shorai bijutsu, studied for style and iconography, and related to pertinent texts. The weighing of this evidence results in the definition of new Maitreya imagery, which may account for the continuation of Northern Qi architectural forms in a work clearly executed during the Tang. This dissertation concludes that although related as portable works of one period each shrine represents a different school of Buddhism, and was created to serve a particular function in disparate cultural contexts. Lastly, the small shrines are shown to be modeled on monumental prototypes--sculpture cycles, banner and wall paintings, and cave temples.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,NA,NA,"Art History, Religious history, History, China, T'ang dynasty",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

The engendering and delimiting of secular and religious spheres was central to China’s turbulent modern history and, although scholars have begun to study the significance of these notions in the twentieth century, religion’s emergence and the specificities of its production are unknown.

Focusing on material culture and folk performances revived in two Beijing folklore markets, the dissertation discusses the neoliberal marketization that coincides with urban commercial zoning in China since the 1980s. The dissertation examines the intertwined cultural and economic dimensions of collective nostalgia, urban marketization and heritage developmentalism. Based on ethnographic and archival research in Beijing from 2010 to 2015, the dissertation addresses China’s collaboration with UNESCO in world cultural heritage program. It looks closely at the process of cultural heritage marketization, which is geared toward a developmental agenda. Such a heritage construction appears in conjuncture with the rise of the new Chinese cultural industry and cultural entrepreneurship, reconfiguring the sociopolitical role of folk arts and folk artists in China. Through the ethnographic lens, the dissertation focuses on depicting the everyday life in contemporary Beijing surrounding folklore marketplaces. In particular, it describes material engagements established by connoisseurs and collectors in two major folklore markets, the Shilihe and the Panjiayuan market, demonstrating a new Chinese folklore connoisseurship that ascends and reconfigured in contemporary Beijing.

305280182,"Lai, Chiu-han Linda","Producing heterotopia: Traces of the cinema in the thick space of governmentality, localism and citizenship in 1934 Hong Kong",Contemporary,"The project began as the quest for an absent history of the pre-war Hong Kong cinema, finally re-defined as the study of one year, an attempt to gain the first sights and sounds of 1934's material existence, a year without monumental significance and before cinema turned full sound. The choice of 1934 problematizes at once normative definitions of significant events and film culture. Upholding spatial realism (as opposed to conceptual realism), I refresh the category of space-time to supercede the time versus space dichotomy in history-writing, thus re-assessing standard historiographic categories like causal relation, continuity, progress, and structure-conjuncture to call for revised narrative models. Spatial realism leads to the critical engagement with mapping, urban morphology, and a sought dialog between production of space and heterotopia. I also critique the notion of film culture, arguing that pro-filmic events need not always be placed in the paradigmatic center to yield productive cinema history, whereas individual films and related activities can be unique nodal points through which factual and fictional histories travel. A multiple-approach chapter scheme establishes the following: that cinema necessarily forms a continuum with other everyday life domains. that quotidian micro-processes involving multiple players best illumine (the effects of) governmentality, and in Hong Kong's case, one looks at the colonial administration's pacification tactics in population management, the promotion of leisure via spatial reproduction, relaxing land purchase and rental legislation, and a bottom-up Cantonization process forging a local identity around a distinct shared dialect, Cantonese. Two key chapters trace my virtual walk through the urban space along key transportation routes, steered by thick description and free story-telling. I reveal traces of the government's constant relocation of Chinese residential clusters as disciplinary measures, and how movie theaters spatially intervened into a minor district as it evolved into modernized urbanity. Seventeen silent and Cantonese-language films are investigated, following the order of their exhibition dates across 1934, emphasizing the textual transportation between cinema and other locations of cultural writings and moral exegesis, yielding a unique picture of production of citizenship via self-techniques.

(3)&#xa0.the relations between the inside and the outside within the context of the intercultural exchange of dance as well as in terms of the questions of cultural interpretation and representation involved. Rather than presenting an all-encompassing, chronological narrative of Taiwan's dance history, the dissertation is organized as a series of topical studies of important developments and eminent phenomena. They include the formation of contemporary dance culture in Taiwan under Japanese colonialism (1930s–1945), the invented tradition of Chinese ethnic dance in the post-War years in relation to the ideologies of anti-communism and state nationalism (1950s–1960s), the quest for a modern Chinese dance theatre and the burgeoning of a Taiwanese consciousness (1970s), the politicalization of the dancing body and the emergence of feminist awareness in dance after the lifting of Martial law (1987–1990s), the influence of postmodern dance languages and the appropriation of postmodernist characteristics in Taiwan's modern dance (1990s), and finally the creation of Eastern body aesthetics for the purpose of the globalization of Taiwanese dance (1986–1990s).",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,NA,NA,"Dance, History, China, Cultural politics, Dance, Taiwan",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

It is known that in the history of Chinese students studying abroad in the first half of the twentieth century, the students who went to the Soviet Union had the most influential impact on shaping the course of modern China. For political reasons and the inaccessibility of archives, no scholarly work has been done on how Chinese students were trained in the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the Communist International founded a few schools in the 1920s and 1930s to train foreigners making revolutions in their home countries. However, there is no comprehensive study on any of the Comintern schools. Sun Yat-sen University provides a good case study to gain insight into the extent of Soviet influence in modern China and gives new information on an important, but inadequately understood period in Sino-Soviet relations. In addition, the study probes the interaction between Chinese students and Soviet politics and culture to explore the potential and limits of cultural transmission. Five years after the establishment of the university, the Comintern claimed it had failed to achieve the goal of training political workers for revolution in China. However, both the Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party greatly benefitted from the Soviet educated students in their knowledge and abilities in party organization, propaganda and intelligence work. Students' educational experience has a great impact on their subsequent careers and on the course of modern Chinese history. The preeminent figures, such as Yang Shangkun, Jiang Jingguo and Deng Xiaoping, were graduates from the university. The main sources of the dissertation come from the recently accessible key archives in Taiwan (the Central Committee Archives on the Five Divisions and the Hankou Archives preserved by the Historical Commission of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang) and in Russia (the Comintern Archives, maintained by the Russian Center for the Preservation and Studies of Documents of Modern History).",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,NA,NA,"Education history, History, European history, China, Russia",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

It is traditionally attributed to Zhao Boju who was active in the early Southern Song. Scholars tend to believe that this painting falls into the late Northern Song. The attribution to Zhao Boju is usually denied. This dissertation is mainly a study of this painting seen within the artistic and cultural context of the times. Based on the assumption of Zhao Boju's authorship of the Autumn Colors, Zhao Boju's biography is reconstructed in Chapter I. His life span is established (b. ca. 1118-1120. d. 1166). The biography of Zhao Bosu, Boju's brother, is also covered. Their artistic attainments in contemporary and later evaluations are discussed in Chapter II. Chapter III is devoted to the history of the use of color before the Southern Song since the Autumn Colors is rendered in colors. A historiographic review on, as well as a different approach to, the development of Chinese painting are provided. The Autumn Colors is able to be placed in the history of Chinese painting. Chapter IV comprises the main body of this dissertation. Section I makes morphological and stylistic analyses on the Autumn Colors, in which technical aspects such as the Blue-and-Green manner or the use of gold are fully expounded. The authorship of Zhao Boju is first established. Section II interprets the content of this painting. I identify the landscape in this painting with the Tianmu Mountains near Hangzhou and explore the nature of this painting. Certain geomantic and political readings can be made. Chapter V deals with other possible attributions of Zhao Boju. The Han Palace is confirmed as out of Zhao Boju's hand through stylistic analysis, and a thematic interpretation is included. The Emperor Minghuang's Journey to Shu, a painting known as a copy after Li Zhaodao, is tentatively re-attributed to Zhao Boju. Profound political significance is discernible in this painting.

304438206,"Chang, Ivy I-chu",Remapping memories and public space: The theater of action in Taiwan's opposition movement and social movements (1986-1997),Contemporary,"In this dissertation, I will investigate how social activists and theater artists employ theatrical techniques and ritualistic elements to develop performative tactics in Taiwan's political opposition movement and social movements, from 1986 to 1997. Along with the KMT (Kuoming Tang) regimes political liberalization in 1986 and the lifting of martial law in 1987, social activists increasingly utilize theater of action to remap memories and public space to reach their goals. These goals include: to redefine nationalism, citizenship, and state-civil society power relations. to represent national identities or group identities. to perform alternative norms, values, and models of living. The term of theater of action was first raised in Taiwan in 1988, at the first coalition between the little theater movement and anti-nuclear movement, Expel the Evil from Lanyu Island. Since then, activists have constantly utilized the techniques of environmental theater to produce real effects through symbolic interactions. To investigate Taiwan's theater of action, I would like to employ Richard Schechner's theory to regard the symbolic public actions incorporating art performance, social critiques, ritualistic performance, entertainment, and mass media as a direct theater that has its own dramaturgy, mise-en-scene, role enactment, audience participation, and reception. (Schechner 1992: 90) Furthermore, I would link theater of action to performativity (Judith Butler 1993: 1-26): it is at the same time the effect as well as the process of the reiterative power of discourse, which makes possible both identification and disidentification with the regulatory norms and imperative. Based on my fieldwork, I will discuss how social actors employ performative tactics from these aspects: (1) represent historical traumas and invoke the repressed social memories to appeal for collective action. (2) seek legal umbrellas and mobilize consensus through indigenous consciousness. (3) carry on love and non-violent confrontation. (4) disseminate their causes through mass media. (5) educate the general population. (6) push legislation. (7) press the government for law enforcement.

1468940050,"Liu, Lihong",Places and Place: Wen Zhengming's Late Work and the Significance of Jing (Scene),Modern,"Central to the work of Wen Zhengming (1470–1559) is the interrelationship between “places” as subject matter and “place” as a pictorial concept in landscape representation, mediated by the notion of jing (scene), which implies both situational experience and painterly ideal. Focusing on Wen’s late work, this dissertation examines the real-life experiential grounding of artistic production and consumption in relation to changes in landscape painting’s morphological and compositional significance during the sixteenth century. In both the representation and compositional use of jing , Wen promoted the principle of buzhi (relational positioning). This practical skill and formal-structural conception that was concerned with how to arrange things in bounded space then became a primary criterion for assessing artistic intelligence and creativity. The same principle was used concurrently in garden-building and everyday landscaping in the increasingly urbanized environment of the Suzhou area, where the artist lived. The artistic attention to relational positioning accorded with the transformation of social grids in a changing economic situation and political climate. Through exhaustive research into Wen’s networked art world, rediscovery of understudied artworks, and an interpretative framework that correlates artistic practices with social-historical and epistemological issues, this dissertation establishes some elements for a new understanding of early modern Chinese painting. Chapter One provides a critical analysis of the concept of jing in order to shed light on the historical notions of the “real” and the “scenic,” and how the return to reality connects to the return to antiquity in the intellectual, literary, and art world of the time. Chapter Two investigate the significance of composition and its correlation with practical learning. Chapter Three examines the role of tree as topos and tectonic form in place-making and the pictorial imagination. Chapter Four discusses the path as formation of a “footfield” in Wen’s paintings through analyzing the spatiotemporal contingencies of the path motif as it negotiates the relations among compositional substructure, figural locomotion, and spectatorial engagement. Chapter Five highlights an overlooked genre of birthday-congratulatory albums depicting specific places, created by and for members of Wen’s social network, which situate personal experience in communal space and dynastic time. By reconsidering modern art history’s foundational assumption that landscape operates between the poles of idealizing subject and topographical description, this dissertation strives to fundamentally reassess early modern Chinese art and visual culture.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,Institute of Fine Arts,Fine Arts,"History, Asian Studies, Art history, China, Jing, Landscape painting, Ming dynasty, Place, Wen, Zhengming",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
993006058,"Ping, Lei",Figures of Capital: A Post-1949 Socio-Spatial Account of Shanghai through Socialism and Postsocialism,Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the historical trajectories of capital and the bourgeois consciousness in the post-1949 socialist and postsocialist Shanghai through a socio-spatial reading of the figures of capital—the Shanghai national bourgeoisie ( minzu zichanjieji ), Shanghai petty urbanites ( xiaoshimin ), house-slaves ( fangnu ) and land-grabbers. It critically examines the multifold irony that emerges from this historical period, namely, how the bourgeois consciousness resiliently survives during the socialist transformation of the Shanghai national bourgeoisie, how the Shanghai urbanite longtang everyday life persistently preserves the bourgeois consciousness, and how the dialectical resurgence of capital relentlessly demolishes the form of Shanghai everyday life and passionately propagates the middle-class homeownership dream in the age of postsocialist Chinese neoliberalism and global capitalism. In this context, the first chapter investigates the historical rationale and limits of the socialist transformation of the Shanghai national bourgeoisie. It questions the completeness and validity of the transformation of the bourgeois consciousness in the socialist transition period (1949–1956). Chapter two further examines the dialectic of the socialist remoulding process by revisiting socialist realist writer Zhou Erfu's novel Morning in Shanghai . It foregrounds Shanghai national capitalists' diversified responses to the socialist transformation project, as well as the embourgeoisment of the socialist remoulders that are captured in the literary representation. Chapter three studies and critiques a particular mode of everyday life—post-1949 Shanghai urbanite longtang everyday life through which it argues that the bourgeois consciousness is aspired and inherited by the longtang petty urbanites and their practices of Shanghai urbanite culture ( shimin wenhua ) and everyday life in the post-1949 socialist Shanghai. The subsequent chapter highlights the violent vanishing and Haussmannization of this distinctive form of Shanghai everyday life by critiquing radical urbanization, privatization and urban housing reform in the post-1992, postsocialist Shanghai. It problematizes the second tidal wave of global capital from which the previously constrained bourgeois consciousness during the combat with socialist revolutionary culture ( geming wenhua ) now saliently fulfills its new historical mandate.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,East Asian Studies,East Asian Studies,"History, Asian Studies, Bourgeois consciousness, Capital, China, Longtang, National bourgeoisie, Petty urbanites, Shanghai, Socialism",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

By examining the evolution of pig-feeding practices through agricultural treatises and other food texts, I explore the simple pig-feeding practices of ancient China, the subsequent expansion of pig farming as the Chinese economy and agriculture expanded from northern China to central China, the shift of pork consumption from a medical orientation to a gastronomic orientation, the gradual substitution of omnivorous and foraging pigs for herbivorous and grazing lambs, and the emergence of pig-based commerce in the early modern era. Throughout these historical stages, pig-husbandry practices matured, permitting an expansion of pork surpluses, which were preserved according to specific curing techniques. Borrowing the concept of terroir, I argue that “localized technical skills” emerged in China’s Jinhua area, where meat curers applied diverse preparatory methods to specific types of pig in combination with specific ingredients (salt, orchids, and pine tree leaves). Eventually, a reputable cued meat emerged: Jinhua Ham. By the Ming-Qing era, Chinese literati were increasingly producing culinary texts as demand for good-tasting pork dishes grew significantly. In this regard, I argue that literati played a critical role in the daily-life production and consumption of Jinhua Ham—a meat that went from being an unknown and localized cured meat to a cross-regional ham product and national brand.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, China, Food studies, Jinhua ham, Ming dynasty, Pig-feeding techniques, Pork consumption, Qing dynasty, Terroir",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
303988363,"Chen, Tsong-yao",Chiang Kai-shek and the Northern Expedition,Contemporary,"Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975) may be remembered for the four major tasks he accomplished during his life time--the Northern Expedition, the war against the Japanese, the struggle against Communism, and building Taiwan into a vital economy. Nevertheless, the impact of these feats has yet to be determined through an historical prism. In other words, the Chinese saying Only when a person passes away, his merits and demerits can be established (kai-kuan lun-ting) is not applicable to him. The present study centers around Chiang's role in the Northern Expedition which started in 1926 and was completed in 1928. Judging by the circumstances at the time, to achieve this historical mission devolved upon him by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Chinese Republic, was by no means easy. The Northern Expedition started in weakness. The National Revolutionary Army under the command of Chiang Kai-shek had only 150,000 officers and men. It was pitted against the total strength of 750,000 troops of three major warlords--Wu P'ei-fu, Sun Chuan-fang, and Chang Tso-lin. In addition, there were breaches in the delicate coalition between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, and the split between the Kuomintang Left and Right Wings over the KMT's twin policy of admitting the Communists and allying with the Russians. Many a twist or turn along the course of the Northern Expedition, such as the March 20th Incident, April 12th Coup, Nanking-Wuhan split, and the Battle of Lung-t'an could have aborted the military campaign. After overcoming all these obstacles, the NRA captured Peking, symbol of national authority, in June 1928. With Young Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang's pledge of loyalty to the National Government in Nanking at the end of 1928, Manchuria came to the nation's fold.

304952478,"Clinton, Margaret","Fascism, cultural revolution, and national sovereignty in 1930s China",Contemporary,"This dissertation traces the emergence and consequences of cultural revolution as it was elaborated by the fascist factions that dominated China's ruling Nationalist Party from 1927-1937. I develop a novel account of the origins of cultural revolution in China by revealing how this concept, typically identified with the Chinese Communist Party, was articulated by Nationalist politicians and soldiers on the eve of World War II to transform China into a militantly-united, self-sufficient, and sovereign nation state. I argue that Nationalist concern to foment a cultural revolution emerged from a confluence of global, regional, and local socio-political transformations and intellectual developments. Building upon ideas and tactics inherited from the May Fourth Movement of 1919 and the Nationalist Party's 1923-1927 experience of Comintern patronage, 1930s fascists articulated an organized program for creating nationalistic artworks and radically transforming popular thinking and everyday activity. Nationalist attention to cultural transformation as a precondition for broad-scale structural change was on the one hand conditioned by China's semi-colonized circumstances, and on the other by the dynamics of civil war as it unfolded after 1927. Openly challenging the incipient cultural revolutionary agenda of the Chinese Communist Party and mirroring the dramatic rightward march of nationalist movements around the world, interwar Nationalists emphasized China's Confucian-spiritual unity and the power of mass action to achieve a sovereign national polity amidst an increasingly volatile world. Throughout the 1930s, Nationalist leaders and supporters anxiously anticipated that the rising fascist powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy intended to carve out empires of their own from those currently possessed by England, France, and the United States. To thwart China's full colonization by Japan, Nationalists proposed ever-more draconian measures to foster rapid industrialization and to bolster civilian capacities for self-defense. This dissertation documents how the Nationalist right called for a cultural revolution, one aspect of which was the New Life Movement, to rationalize everyday behavior, to inculcate work discipline, and to foster respect for Confucian social hierarchies. In tandem with nationalistic films, literature, and artwork, these measures aimed to cultivate the national unity necessary to eradicate communism and avert the impending Japanese occupation.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,History,History,"History, China, Cultural revolution, Fascism, National development, National sovereignty, Nineteen 30s",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

In the early 1800s the first Protestant missionaries arrived in China and established connections with British East India Company and American traders. As the Qing government made hesitant pronouncements against opium, many western companies considered profits from the trade grounds for its continuation, while the missionaries were caught between their financial relationship with the trading companies and the opium trade stigma. In the period before the first Opium War (1839–42), the problem of opium consumption simultaneously linked together and split apart the interests of the above groups. These problems justified the trade with and within China, and at the same time symbolized what was “wrong with China.” The dissertation illuminates links between global actors previously treated individually: British and American traders and missionaries, and Chinese officials and subjects who had everyday contact with Westerners.

(Volumes I and II)",Modern,"In 1689 the Russians and Chinese concluded the Nerchinsk Treaty which set the basis for Sino-Russian relations until the mid-19th century. An important factor influencing the negotiations of this treaty was the invasion of Outer Mongolia by the Zunghar Mongols. However most of the literature dealing with this period treat them as only a minor factor in Russian-Chinese relations. In reality the Zunghar Mongols played an important role in relations between China and Russia as this dissertation attempts to demonstrate. This thesis traces how the Russians and the Manchus building their Central Asian empires first collided with the Mongols and then each other in the 17th century. Russia expanding its colonial possessions from Siberia annexed the Buryat-Mongols and then clashed with the Khalkha Mongols. At the same time Russians invaded the Amur river valley. Here they fought the Manchus who had just conquered China in 1644. Earlier the Manchus had moved into Inner Mongolia incorporating the Chakhar Mongols into their Banner system. Later they attempted to control the Khalkha Mongols, fighting with the Zunghar Mongols who had just unified themselves in 1640. The Zunghar Mongols tried to found their own empire by attacking the Khalkha Mongols and the Kazakhs. But this only resulted in the Khalkha Mongols turning the China and the Kazakhs to Russia for protection. This power struggle ended when the Manchus utterly destroyed the Zunghar Khanate in 1758. When the Zunghar Khan died, his realm split apart. One faction of Mongols, invited the Middle Kingdom into this fighting. The Manchus took advantage of this invitation to annihilate their old enemies, while the Russians stood by observing a policy of neutrality. The downfall of the Zunghar Khanate marked the end of the influence of the nomads upon world history under such leaders as Chinggis-khan and Tamerlane.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,NA,NA,"History, European history, China, Mongols",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1638274532,"Hayward-Smith, Elizabeth Jane",State of the Peasantry The Agrarian Question in Contemporary China,Contemporary,"The historical trajectory of the Chinese state since 1978 has been determined by China's agrarian nature. Against conventional accounts which view the peasant as having no place in the modern world, I seek to reveal the centrality of the 'peasant', as a political category, to projects of modernization. Taking an 'internationalization of the state' perspective, I locate contemporary Chinese debates on the 'peasant question' in a long international history of debates on the agrarian question, showing how struggles over the strategies of power seizure and state-building have turned on competing conceptions of the peasant's nature as a political, social and economic subject. I seek to dislodge the stereotype of the 'backward' peasant by highlighting alternative conceptions of the peasant subject—including those which envisage the peasant as a progressive, modernizing force. Developing the common trope of the peasant as possessing an essentially dual nature, I argue that conceptions of the peasantry can be divided, crudely, into three categories: feudal, socialist and capitalist. I demonstrate how each of these categories operates centrally within debates about the organization of labor, land and production—questions which themselves underly the form of the state itself and the nature of state-building. For example, I show how debates on rural land organization under Mao pivoted on whether the peasant was viewed as essentially feudal, socialist, or capitalist. I argue that Deng Xiaoping's triumph over Hua Guofeng in the late '70s hinged on his conviction that the peasant was more individualist entrepreneur than lover of egalitarian community. I examine how the peasant of the rural boom in the early '80s was hailed as the embodiment of modernization, while during the '90s, as the countryside was increasingly utilized as a source of cheap labor extraction, state discourse increasingly portrayed the peasant as feudal—exposure to the international market seen as its salvation.

It shows the eugenic and evolutionist limits to radical or liberal intellectuals' understanding of the role of the individual in the pursuit of sex, free love and birth control. The study examines the scientific view of modernity embodied in eugenics, as well as the challenges to this vision based on humanism and sex aestheticism. Bertrand Russell's visit to China in 1920 with his lover Dora Black led to heated discussions surrounding free love and free divorce, where privacy, the eugenic idea of a robust individual and science were key. Meanwhile, translations and the reception of Ellen Key and Havelock Ellis's works on eugenics and love underpinned the reconciliation in Chinese liberal intellectuals' thought between individualism/evolutionary humanism and eugenics, particularly in their debates on sexual and emotional ethics in the 1920s. Margaret Sanger's visit to China in 1922 opened up a debate on the suitability of eugenic birth control to solve China's problems, such as overpopulation and venereal disease. By probing into her interactions with Chinese intellectuals in 1922, this study reveals how her eugenic ideas were received, as well as the political tensions regarding her birth control advocacy. The dissertation demonstrates that the sexual reproductive considerations that had been viewed in the 1920s as a problem of the relationship between the individual and nation/race/society, by the 1930s came to completely subordinate the role of the individual to national and racial regeneration concerns. Sanger's continued correspondence with Chinese medical professionals came to shape the birth control movement in the 1930s in more strictly eugenic terms. This research contends that eugenics was not only influential in discourse, but came to be implemented in practice in the fields of sex hygiene, birth control and VD regulation. The agency of pioneer female gynecologists in the 1930s is emphasized by examining how they brought eugenics in practice in their birth control clinics, how they localized global female experience and theories on birth control and hygiene, either through translation or through their attempts to reach working class women with contraceptive sex education. Lastly I argue that eugenics and social hygiene also functioned as a male oriented ideology in VD policies of various colonial powers: British, American, Japanese, and French as part of an economy of empire. By contrast Chinese Nationalist Hygiene Campaigns and female gynecologists' internalizing of eugenics focused on female health.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,History,History,"History, Science history, Gender studies, Birth control, China, Eugenics, Free love, Individualism and ellen key, Sanger, Margaret, Sexuality, Venereal disease",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
2030000001,"Cole, Robert William","""""To Save the Village"""": Confronting Chinese Rural Crisis in the Global 1930s",Contemporary,"During the 1920s–30s, China’s vast countryside appeared to be on the verge of social collapse: crop yields were falling, peasant indebtedness soared, and increasing numbers of rural families made the wrenching decision to abandon their land and seek new, uncertain urban livelihoods. This dissertation examines how researchers, reformers, and revolutionaries both within China and around the world struggled to understand and to intervene in this agrarian crisis, arguing that interwar inquiries into the state of China’s agrarian economy were part of a much broader attempt to make sense of the modern transformations underway in agricultural societies worldwide. The Chinese piece of this global story unfolded in individual rural communities. In the 1920s and 1930s, hundreds of researchers educated in China, Japan, Europe, and North America fanned out across the countryside, funded by a range of transnational sources and informed by new social scientific methods. Local leaders undertook a myriad of ambitious social and economic experiments—creating new agricultural currencies, organizing cooperative credit societies, and introducing new approaches to the valuation and exchange of farmland—all aimed at turning theories of crisis into concrete political action. Through a series of case studies, this dissertation shows how Chinese researchers and reformers looked to the world for conceptual and empirical models that could help them understand these local problems, even as they used local experiences to reflect on and interpret global theories of agrarian crisis.

305166140,"Miao, Yen-Wei",From cultural capital to national stigma: The anti-footbinding movements in China and Taiwan,Contemporary,"This study analyzes how the millennium-long practice of footbinding declined as a national stigma at the turn of the twentieth century in China and Taiwan. The first part focuses on the process whereby footbinding was enframed within the ocularcentric modernity. The hegemonic technologies of seeing—via journalism, medical science, exhibitions, photography, and radiography—not only visualized what had been concealed under the binding cloths but also constructed, represented and displayed it as something evil in accordance with the episteme of vision: pathologically, disease and filthiness. anthropologically, markers of barbarism. and aesthetically, the hideous taste of beauty. The second part examines the social-cultural contexts that sustained and popularized the practice of footbinding. It explores the significance of bound feet in the formation of gender and ethnic identity as well as of the gentry habitus, by which girls' footbinding, like boys' studying, symbolized as a form of cultural capital for themselves and their families with which to maintain or approach a higher social position. The opening-up of an “in-between” space (treaty ports) and the emergence of “in-between” elites (compradors and new intellectuals), which brought about a hybrid culture and challenged the gentry habitus, is discussed as well. The third part looks at four efforts to abolish footbinding, each of which was characterized by a specific cultural framing shared by its activists. The anti-footbinding movement in late-nineteenth-century treaty ports organized by Western missionaries and memsahibs, who consciously or unconsciously assumed responsibility for the civilizing mission, highlighted an ideology of cultural imperialism. The anti-footbinding movement led by late-Qing reform nationalists centered around the discourse of national preservation. The anti-footbinding campaigns in the Republican era launched by state regimes with relative stability—the warlord regime in Shanxi Province, the Nationalists' Nanjing regime and the Communists' Yanan regime—exemplified the state-building projects in relation to social control, economic production, and war mobilization. The anti-footbinding movement in colonial Taiwan initiated by native elites who agreed with the colonial authorities' condemnation of footbinding highlighted the colonial discourse and anticipated the overall colonization of lifestyles.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,NA,NA,"Social structure, History, Womens studies, Antifootbinding movements, China, Colonial discourse, Cultural capital, Footbinding, National stigma, Taiwan",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
303860637,"Sun, William Huizhu",The peasants' theatre experiment in Ding Xian county (1932-1937),Contemporary,"The Ding Xian theatre experiment was a part of China's mass education movement sponsored by Americans including the Rockefeller family. The experiment was led by Xiong Foxi, once a student of Brender Matthews at Columbia University and then a leading playwright and theatre educator in China before he went to Ding Xian, a social laboratory of MEM in the '30s. Ding Xian had a strong tradition of yangge, a stylized sung drama performed at annual festivals and temple fairs. But Xiong and his colleagues showed peasants realistic social problem drama. The peasants not only loved it but soon organized village troupes to do it themselves. In learning and doing the new theatre, they brought with them their old habits cultivated in open-air festivals of sung drama. The most important was breaking the curtain line. With no idea of the fourth wall demarcating performers and audience, fiction and reality, peasant spectators often spontaneously joined a performance in progress about their life performed by their fellow villagers. Xiong, taking advantage of the peasants' frame-vagueness, wrote and directed open-air masses' plays and designed special open-air theatres to facilitate massive audience participation for the village troupes. Coinciding with such Western experimenters as Meyerhold and Reinhardt, this environmental production mode mainly resulted from the peasants' spontaneity and the professionals' adjustment to their needs. This study traces how spoken drama replaced sung drama--then evolved into environmental theatre incorporating traditional styles yet presenting new ideas. It explores why such radical changes took place in the underdeveloped villages. It also sheds some light on contemporary theatre experimenters' problem with audience participation: true audience participation occurs during audience-oriented performances done by performers akin to their audience.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,NA,NA,"Theater, Language arts, History, China, environmental theater, theater",26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States

This dissertation examines the nature of the relationship between Jewish refugees and their Chinese neighbors from 1937-1948. While some scholars have sought to highlight the ways that the Jewish refugee and Chinese populations of Shanghai found common cause, this dissertation argues that most Jewish refugees and Chinese residents of the city were predisposed to treat each other with ambivalence and even skepticism at times. By contextualizing Sino-Jewish relations on the ground within the history of semi-colonialism in China, this research underscores the crucial power dynamics that underlay the vast cultural differences between both populations. Although stateless and poor, refugees still appeared as white foreigners in a city where the whole colonial project rested upon a racial hierarchy that placed local Chinese on the lowest rung. Amid the backdrop of Shanghai’s multicultural social landscape, Jewish refugees and Chinese locals both racialized each other along the lines of the preconceived notions they harbored. Neither colonizers nor colonized, Jewish refugees carved out places for themselves within the network of layered colonial spheres that had been established primarily by Europeans after the Opium Wars. Liminal parties within this greater milieu, many Jewish refugees used their European notions of public health, hygiene, labor, and living standards to draw boundaries between themselves and their Chinese neighbors. Jewish refugees even derived certain legal privileges from foreign intervention in China at times, revealing the porousness of Shanghai’s colonial institutions. In the end, Sino-Jewish relations in Shanghai both during and after the war remained laden by wartime deprivation and the legacies of whiteness and foreignness in China. By placing Sino-Jewish encounters squarely within the context of semi-colonialism China, this dissertation ultimately seeks to integrate Asia into the growing field of Holocaust geographies, while decentering the Holocaust within the history of Jewish refugee migration during World War II.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,New York University,Hebrew and Judaic Studies and History,Near Eastern and Judaic Studies,NA,26,New York City,New York,40.6943,-73.9249,United States
1037065505,"Li, Yan",In search of a socialist modernity: The Chinese introduction of Soviet culture,Contemporary,"The first decade of communist rule in China featured the widespread introduction of Soviet culture that transformed the lives of ordinary Chinese citizens. The Chinese Communist Party familiarized the populace with a spectrum of Soviet cultural forms, such as architecture, fashion, film, and literature, through every possible channel with the intention of cementing their hold on power and pushing a program of international socialist modernization. However, while in general the popularization of Soviet culture generally achieved anticipated results, at times mass interpretation of Soviet cultural products differed considerably from the intentions of the new regime. The results of this decade-long transnational cultural engagement with the Chinese public's mentality, behavior patterns, and belief systems remain far-reaching to the present day. Two questions are relevant to understanding this transformation: 1) How did the Chinese government exploit the Soviet culture to mold socialist new citizens? and 2) How did the Chinese people utilize the language and imagery from Soviet cultural products to express their own vision and understanding of socialist modernity? Using methodologies in mass communication, cultural studies, literary criticism, and film studies, this dissertation will answer these questions and explain the process by which the values of the PRC party-state and the Chinese masses contested, negotiated, and colluded. In so doing, this study will not only shed new light on early PRC history and Sino-Soviet relations, but it will also contribute to understanding the transnational cultural dynamics shaping the evolution of the communist world.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,Northeastern University,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, World History, Social structure, China, Cultural interaction, Early PRC, Socialism, Soviet culture, Transnationalism",2,Boston,Massachusetts,42.3188,-71.0852,United States
304815012,"Hu, Aiqun",Social insurance in twentieth-century China: A global historical perspective,Contemporary,"This study analyzes China's social insurance movement in the twentieth century in global historical perspective. Social insurance is defined as an employment-related income maintenance system for old-age, sickness, unemployment, maternity, and work injury, but also viewed as the historical core of the welfare state. The global perspective of the analysis is a creative synthesis of Meyer's theory of world society, diffusion theories, and theories of the welfare state based on the experience of Western industrial democracies (modernization theory, neo-Marxism, and state-centered theories). The study argues that China's social insurance movement partially resulted from diffusion of competing world models of social insurance - the capitalist and socialist models - through interactions of global forces (such as the International Labor Organization, international advisors, and national polities) with Chinese national forces, for most of the twentieth century. In the 1980s, however, China switched to the mainstream world model provided by the ILO, and then in the 1990s to the neo-liberal model of individual accounts advocated by such global neo-liberal forces as the World Bank. While global forces provided the basic intellectual framework, national and local forces determined the timing and specifics of the adoption of social insurance programs. During this process, Chinese national forces contributed in turn to the development of world models of social insurance. Through the entire twentieth century, various Chinese governments stressed Chinese situations and Chinese characteristics whose essence was regarded as the Confucian heritage. These terms, however, were defined increasingly in terms of the competing global norms and principles. This study not only fills a major gap in Chinese studies, but also extends the theory of social diffusion and the study of the welfare state.

Seeing the prevalent political oppression and economic exploitation, Liang proposed to revive Confucian traditions as the leading force for the national salvation of China. However, due to cultural differences and the prevalent social evils created by Western institutions, Liang was opposed to the implementation of political democracy and economic capitalism in China. Modernization, according to Liang, does not necessarily mean westernization. In spite of the fact that Liang himself tried to make China a society of Confucianistic socialism, he opposed the Chinese communists' class struggle for political revolution as well as the adoption of the Soviet-communist economic model on the grounds that they were inconsistent with the Chinese cultural spirit. Liang saw the weaknesses and strengths of the Chinese culture, attempted to merge China's strengths with that of Western science and technology and Confucian ethics and moral intuition. He wanted to decentralize the political power of the state into local communities so as to promote political participation, economic development, and mass mobilization among the populace. He adopted hsiang-yueh (village covenant), a traditional institution, in the Tsou-p'ing experimental district to strengthen the rural community. Under hsiang-yueh, the villagers, old and young, men and women, were devoted to mutual exhortation, moral scrutiny, and mutual aid. Liang also revived chiang-hsueh, the ideal close and intimate small groups, a relationship adopted by Confucius with his fellowers. The effect of chiang-hseuh was to promote internal virtue for mobilization. By reviving these two traditional institutions, Liang designed the school center on the hsien and hsiang levels to replace the governmental administration. With the effect of substituting the school for government and the society, community development was to be realized. The whole concept of Liang Shu-ming's social reform is significant from an adult educator's viewpoint.

1883382632,"Yang, Xiao",Between National Imagination and Social Critique: Female Figurations in Pang Xunqin and Fu Baoshi's Wartime Chinese Painting (1930s-40s),Contemporary,"This dissertation provides the first in-depth comparative study in any language of the female figurations made, viewed, and interpreted in the realm of refashioning modern Chinese painting during the war period of Republican China (1930s-1940s) in the Nationalist government-controlled southwestern inner frontier, with projects by Pang Xunqin (1906–85) and Fu Baoshi (1904–65) as disparate yet related case studies. This dissertation pays particular attention to two themes of Pang and Fu’s wartime projects. One is their study of Chinese art antiquity as an attempt to modernize Chinese art historiography after the May Fourth New Culture Movement. The other is their wartime paintings featuring their perceived native southwestern women clad in traditional costumes, such as Pang’s Guizhou Mountain People and Fu’s Mountain Spirit. Investigating the different modes of cultural-making practices of these two artists, this dissertation examines the Chinese artistic modernity embodied in the wartime nativist trend of making female figurations. This dissertation argues that these Han Chinese male artists’ wartime art historiography and female figurations should be understood as their cultural-making practices of reinventing China’s artistic past. Two entangled concerns were embedded in the wartime dynamics of making, viewing, and interpreting these projects of refashioning Chinese modernity in painting—that is, a national imagination of China’s past and a social critique of China’s wartime conditions at the present. Chapter 1 interrogates the Han Chinese ethnographic eye embedded in Pang Xunqin’s May-Fourth-inflected modernist approach to the “folk” during the 1930s and 40s in his Chinese art historiography and Guizhou Mountain People paintings. This chapter argues that Pang’s quest for China’s native aesthetic tradition, inspired by a surge of wartime nationalism and displacement, epitomizes a primitivist paradigm in which the Han Self was to be rediscovered in the multicultural southwestern inner frontier of China, a secure cultural zone untouched by Euro-American modernity. Chapter 2 examines Pang’s entangled national and social concerns during the 1930s and 40s as exemplified in his feminization of southwestern non-Han ethnic groups. It explores the ways in which multiple European and Japanese modernities were appropriated and transformed in Pang’s formation of a singular aesthetic of “decorative realism.” This chapter argues that a significant reason why Pang’s self-proclaimed “classicist” paintings of Guizhou Mountain People were publicly criticized by the Nationalist-government official in charge of wartime propaganda as pictures “harming the image of the nation” was that the female figurations could be viewed as a southwestern variant of the female symbols Pang created with social concerns during the early and middle 1930s. Chapter 3 studies Fu Baoshi’s wartime paintings of female figures drawn from Chuci and modeled on the female archetype traditionally attributed to legendary Eastern Jin artist Gu Kaizhi. It sets Fu’s emphasis on Han cultural patrimony in contrast to Pang’s cosmopolitan aesthetic vision in refashioning modern Chinese painting, examining how Fu made a cultural and political allegory of China’s past and present. Reading Fu’s painting and Chinese art historiography, this chapter reveals how Fu rejuvenated and re-conceptualized his selected schools and period styles associated with the literati ink aesthetic discourse as a distinctively Chinese paradigm of intellectual art. Contextualizing Fu’s Mountain Spirit (1946) in the intellectual politics of studying national antiquity during the Civil War, this chapter argues that Fu transformed the Pre-Qin Shamanic motif from Chuci into a female figuration of wartime China and a political allegory of the unfinished Chinese Revolution.",2017,2017,Ph.D.,United States,Northwestern University,Art History,Art History,"Asian Studies, Art history, History, Baoshi, Fu, China, Chinese painting, National imagination, Nationalism, Social critique, Xunqin, Pang",5,Evanston,Illinois,42.0464,-87.6943,United States

I argue that, in this period, figure painting assumed a central role to painters who sought to reform Chinese art, which was commonly understood as “declining.” This investigation will focus on the achievements of the Lingnan School ( lingnan pai), which originated in the region of Guangdong but attained national recognition in the period of investigation. Attention will be paid to three painters of this school, namely Gao Jianfu, Fang Rending, and Huang Shaoqiang, whose figure painting was guided by divergent concerns to reform Chinese art. Chapter one analyzes figure painting as a discursive construct. By first tracing the emergence of discourses that Chinese art was “in decline,” the chapter will examine how such discourses endowed figure painting with symbolic meaning. The efforts to introduce European figure painting to China will also be investigated. Chapter two examines Gao Jianfu’s relationship with figure painting. The chapter traces this abnormal eruption of interest in figure painting and argues that it could be dated back to the 1930s when Gao was presented with a dilemma as his earlier successful formulae turned out to be not as effective. Chapter three delineates the career of Fang Rending, who was preoccupied with the concern to represent his “times” (shidai). By examining Fang’s exhibition activities in the Republican period, this chapter will show how Fang presented a different version of a “contemporary figure painting” each time, as well as his continuous effort to rebuild the vocabulary of the genre in ink and brush. The final chapter investigates Huang Shaoqiang’s quest to paint for “the people” by visualizing the experiences of the poor and the socially neglected. The discussion will examine the development of his idiosyncratic visual vocabulary and narrative strategies, which had a strong pessimistic flavor. This chapter will also demonstrate that his obsession with the realist ideal to “paint for the people” led him into structural difficulties that he was unable to resolve.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Northwestern University,Art History,Art History,"Communication and the arts, Social sciences, Figure painting, Lingnan School, Republican China,",5,Evanston,Illinois,42.0464,-87.6943,United States
1722049130,"Thilly, Peter Dewitt","Treacherous waters: Drug smuggling in coastal Fujian, 1832-1938",Contemporary,"This dissertation is a social history of the “opium century” – the one hundred years during which opiate narcotics dominated the Chinese economy and became normalized within Chinese society. It is also a local history, focusing on the particular experience of the people living along the southern Fujian littoral. It is a story of change over time, exploring the chains of connection and patterns of divergence between the 1830s, when the opium trade first began to truly flourish on the Fujian coast, and the 1930s, when drugs were intertwined with nearly every aspect of social, political and economic life in the region. Unlike previous studies of opium, which have focused either on states and institutions or on the culture of consumption, “Treacherous Waters” is built on the premise that we can learn something important about the world by examining the lives of drug traders. It is this focus on people and profits that allows me to say something new about some of the most well-studied questions in Chinese and global history. Why was the opium trade so big, and how did it remain so vital for so long? How as historians should we understand the importance of the opium trade? “Treacherous Waters” shows why the ordinary people who traded in opium mattered. Opium was a source of livelihood, which people defended, often violently, against the incursion of powerful institutions and states. By focusing on the criminal brokers who operated the drug trade, “Treacherous Waters” tells overlapping stories about the local experiences of global imperialism, nationalism, statebuilding and corruption. The people who dealt in drugs, over the course of the opium century, carved out a particular capitalist version of local power in the face of encroaching, modernizing states. In so doing, drug traders transformed the processes of nation-building and imperialism in China. Drug traders were the original traitors, enemies of the nationalist enterprise. They also made their own meanings out of imperialism and statebuilding projects, and in examining their experiences, “Treacherous Waters” sheds new light on how modern Chinese history unfolded during the chaos of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Northwestern University,History,History,"History, China, Drug trade, Fujian, Maritime, Opium, Smuggling",5,Evanston,Illinois,42.0464,-87.6943,United States
915713919,"Sng, Tuan-Hwee",Size and Agency Problems in Early Modern China and Japan,Pre-modern,"This thesis uses principal-agent theory to make sense of China’s reversal of fortune between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. My hypothesis emphasizes the role of size in shaping China’s fiscal and organizational possibilities. I argue that the vast geographic size of the Chinese empire created immense difficulties for the imperial court to monitor state agents dispersed across the country. This in turn gave these agents strong incentives to extort from the taxpayers, especially the politically weak ones. Consequently, the imperial court had to keep taxes low and the bureaucracy small to prevent overexploitation that could foment rebellion. The Qing state’s fiscal weakness was initially masked by its huge tax base. However, between 1700 and 1850, China’s population more than doubled. This aggravated the managerial diseconomies of scale embedded in its political institutions, intensified corruption, and put a further squeeze on state finances. The result was the paradox of a weakening state despite an expanding economy. The ensuing political instability eventually put a halt to sustained economic expansion. The thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 1 sets up the research question. Using historical records, I reconstruct the Qing dynasty’s tax revenues between 1650 and 1850. The results show that economic expansion did not benefit state coffers in the long run. The Qing state’s fiscal capacity contracted steadily after the early eighteenth century, even as the economy continued to grow extensively. This development was accompanied by a gradual withdrawal of the state’s involvement in public goods provision over time. Chapter 2 presents an explanation of the historical patterns observed in Chapter 1. To establish the hypothesis formally, a model is set up and tested. In line with its predictions, I find that the Qing state taxed less and set up fewer counties in regions further away from the capital Beijing. If distance matters, we should also observe a higher level of fiscal and administrative efficiency in a smaller but otherwise similar country. In Chapter 3, Chiaki Moriguchi and I analyze Tokugawa Japan from a comparative perspective.

2723448363,"Yang, Guangshuo ",Between the Animal Kingdom and Modern States: Animal Protectionism and the Transcultural Making of Chinese Modernity,Contemporary,"Using the rise and fall of a Buddhist-led animal protection movement as my primary case study, I explain how debates about the nature of animals figured into the making of state-centric Chinese nationalism between 1895 and 1955. By reading “animals” as an index of sociopolitical changes, I illustrate how different cultural groups negotiated their power relationships through competing ideas about animals over cosmology, law, public health, and political legitimacy. Piecing together diverse archival documents, I demonstrate how the instrumental view of animals came into prominence through translated Euro-American science and reinterpreted local traditions in epistemology and spiritual beliefs. As nationalists struggled to transform the Qing Empire into a unified modern state, nonhuman animals became inscribed into textbooks as fodder for nation-building. State-led extermination campaigns against pestified species, the expanding industrialized exploitation of animals, and intensifying biopolitical policing of humans prompted monks and lay Buddhists to promote animal protection to redress the immoral excesses of this shift. Against the claim of scientific truth, Buddhists and their secular allies invoked traditional beliefs in the cosmic connections between humans and other species with a modern twist. For example, cosmopolitan poetess Lü Bicheng (1883–1943) cited European vegetarianism and Anglo-American animal welfare campaigns in articulating animal care as central to a “true civilization.” Lü’s vision struck a chord with an unlikely alliance of Buddhist modernists, cultural conservatives, and secular humanists who saw animal protection as one way to enhance China’s international standing. The movement persisted throughout World War II but quickly declined after the Communist Revolution, which heralded the shift to a more instrumental view of animals, humans, and the environment in the name of state-led development.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,Northwestern University,History,History,NA,5,Evanston,Illinois,42.0464,-87.6943,United States

Loo, 1880-1957), a leading international art dealer, and his role in the circulation and reception of Chinese antiquities in the United States between 1915 and 1950. By investigating the modes of transaction, network, conceptual framework, and visual strategies in his business, I argue that C. T. Loo played a significant role in the framing of “Chinese art” by situationally capitalizing on the boundaries between different territories, concepts, and roles in the market-museum-academia network. The introduction places Loo against the theoretical and historical background of the exchange, study, and display of Chinese antiquities in America. The first part of this dissertation focuses on the modes of transaction and social networks in his dealing. The second part investigates how Loo’s negotiation of the spatial-temporal-cultural boundaries recontextualized ancient Chinese art in modern America. The last part examines Loo’s presentational strategies, which articulated the power relations in his operations. This dissertation concludes that although C. T. Loo, as a network builder and cultural mediator, played an important role in the formation of Chinese art collections in America, his dealing was based on America’s capitalist and imperialist logic that Chinese antiquities were to be consumed by the rich and the powerful in modern America.

Findings and Conclusions . This research examines the legal culture as presented in 348 case stories published in 16 th and 17 th century China. It demonstrates how it is significantly different from the hegemonic legal culture prevailed in this period as it focuses on crimes and the judicial process, takes an instrumental approach to courtrooms that represented legal order and judges who represented the governmental authorities, and places more confidence and hope in the universal rules of justice than in legal rules and legal agents. Focusing on human agents, the producers (mainly book merchants and grass-roots scholars), and utilizing the key concept “social resource”, this research reveals how this legal culture was produced. It argues that the producers actively translated their intentions into the production principles, i.e.,“to teach” and “to entertain”. Guided by these principles, producers creatively appropriated and utilized the social resources they brought into the culture production process and shaped the features of the legal culture they produced. This research demonstrates how social members who had little legal and political power actively participated in the production and dissemination of legal culture in 16 th and 17 th century China fueled by economic prosperity and commercialization process.

304756555,"Morton, Dirk Richard","Becoming a good neighbor in Southeast Asia: The case of China's territorial disputes in the South China Sea, 1989–2006",Contemporary,"Since the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between China and the ASEAN states following the end of the Cold War, Sino-ASEAN relations have widened and deepened considerably. This is surprising, considering that most ASEAN states viewed China as a revisionist power and threat to regional security during the Cold War and Vietnam and the Philippines have a history of armed conflict with China over as-of-yet unresolved territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Given the withdrawal of American military forces from the Philippines in 1992 and the steady growth of Chinese economic and military power, one might expect ASEAN's traditionally-held threat perceptions of China to continue or even increase. This, however, is not the case as China is viewed increasingly in Southeast Asia as a cooperative, responsible good neighbor and Sino-ASEAN relations continue to deepen. This study argues that a reorientation of Chinese regional foreign policy is the principal force responsible for these surprising turn of events, and that ideational factors supervened structural factors in inducing this reorientation. Through a historical analysis within a social constructivist theoretical framework of arguably the most contentious issue in Sino-ASEAN relations, this study concludes that China's cognitive base was changed as a result of complex social learning induced by increased diplomatic interaction with ASEAN which, in turn, led to Beijing's successful good neighbor diplomacy and the subsequent emergence of China's new post-Cold War identity in Southeast Asia and beyond.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Old Dominion University,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, South China Sea, Southeast Asia, Territorial disputes",1,Norfolk,Virginia,36.8945,-76.259,United States
303860245,"Finkelstein, David Michael","From abandonment to salvation: The evolution of United States policy toward Taiwan, 1949-1950",Contemporary,"This dissertation traces the evolution of United States policy toward Taiwan from January 1949 until the outbreak of the war in Korea in June 1950. It details Washington's efforts to save the island from a communist invasion. It argues, however, that the military and political constraints that policy makers placed upon ways to achieve that goal resulted, by January 1950, in the decision to write off the island. At that time Chiang Kai-shek was abandoned to save Taiwan through his own efforts. Had the war in Korea not erupted in June 1950, the United States would not have intervened with military force to neutralize Taiwan. This study relies almost exclusively upon declassified government documents. It exploits the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the records of the National Security Council, State Department cables and memoranda, and the personal papers of such critical decision makers as President Truman, Dean Acheson, Douglas MacArthur, various State Department officials, and prominent pro-Nationalist Congressmen. The dissertation offers a detailed analysis of State's Titoist policy toward Peking, the linkage of Taiwan policy to larger goals in East Asia, and places this policy dilemma within the greater context of the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the domestic political environment then prevailing in the United States. It offers as well an inner history of the Truman administration. It examines the men who made the policies. Dean Acheson, Dean Rusk, George Kennan, Walton Butterworth, Louis Johnson and the State Department China Hands. It details the intellectual baggage these men brought to their positions, their professional experiences, their personal animosities, and their bureaucratic struggles to develop a viable policy toward Taiwan. Moreover, this study presents an examination of the intelligence, raw and finished, upon which these men acted. Finally, this study offers a detailed look at prevailing conditions on Taiwan from 1945 to 1950.

This dissertation explores a crucial aspect of these relations, examining how global commerce, and Americans’ ideas about global commerce, produced theories and practices of power. It approaches this wide subject from the perspective of Americans’ trade with Asia, known colloquially to contemporaries and historians alike as the “China trade,” after the empire that made up its largest and most influential component. Notable for its global reach—the demands of Asian markets took Americans all over the world in search of silver specie and rare commodities—the commerce also permeated the political imagination of policymakers in the early republic. Tracing changes in the material reality and ideological import of this complex commerce through the files of mercantile firms, the archives of the American and British governments, the correspondence of scientific associations, and a wide survey of print culture, this dissertation reconstructs how Americans created, communicated, and used knowledge about Asian trade as it moved from the decks of ships to the floor of Congress, and everywhere in between. The China trade, this study reveals, served as a motive and a medium for U.S. politics. Focusing on the politics of the China trade shows us the surprisingly global range of early Americans’ political vision. From the origins of the trade in the 1780s through to the onset of the Civil War, the capital, goods, and people that made up the U.S.-China trade were deeply intertwined with the struggles that defined the early American state. Conflicts over the political economy required to maintain the republic’s independence, the nature of sovereignty, federalism, and states’ rights, the balance between westward expansion and intensive economic development, and the status of free and unfree labor were all profoundly affected by Americans’ global commerce, and their ideas about that commerce. Expanding our knowledge of politics beyond the narrow continental or Atlantic borders to which it has heretofore been confined, this dissertation offers a new model for understanding how a global perspective on political economy structured Americans’ relations with other peoples—and each other.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,History,History,"American studies, History, American history, International Relations, Antebellum, China, Commerce, Early republic, Political economy, United States",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

To obtain a fresh perspective on the evidence for early writing from China, it looks at how the ideological and administrative needs of the early state were met in five other regions of the world—Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Maya lowlands, Central Mexico, and the Andes. What role did writing play in royal legitimation? in the state administration? in the rise and development of the state as an imagined community? States in Central Mexico and the Andes, which did not employ writing, help us to grasp the power of writing by showing what was involved in doing without it. Although the cross-cultural comparisons made here discover differences, on balance it is the similarities that seem most striking. Differences of culture do not seem to entail major differences in the state's uses for writing.

275622122,"Xu, Jay Jie",The Sanxingdui site: Art and archaeology,Ancient,"The Sanxingdui site is a Neolithic and early Bronze Age site in the Chengdu Plain of western Sichuan in southwest China. In 1986, two pits were found at the site containing an astonishing amount of wealth in the form of hundreds of bronzes alongside stone and jade implements, gold objects, and elephant tusks. The most shocking revelation was the bronze sculptures, which account for the majority of the bronzes. Ranging from miniature to monumental in size, they include human-like figures, fantastic creatures, dragons, birds, and trees the likes of which had never been seen before in Sichuan or anywhere else. This sculptural tradition and iconography contrast sharply with other ancient traditions in China. Around the same time, traces of an ancient wall were recognized, leading eventually to the discovery of a large walled settlement. These finds at Sanxingdui prove beyond doubt that the site was home to a major civilization previously unknown. The present dissertation is a comprehensive survey of art and archaeology of the Sanxingdui site. It attempts to sort out the basics of the site: its archaeological history, the components of its archaeological record, the spatial and temporal dimensions of the site, and the elite material culture evidenced in the contents of the two pits as well as other related finds. Focusing particularly on the two pits, the dissertation addresses the nature of the pits. the typology of artifacts and their origins, functions, and cultural associations. the iconography and original appearances of the bronze sculptures. and the bronze fabrication technology and its cultural implications.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Art history, Ancient China, Archaeology, Bronze casting technology, Bronze sculptures, China, Sacrificial pits, Sanxingdui site, Sichuan archaeology",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

By serving as middlemen between the Central Plain civilizations and the Northern Steppe, the societies on the Loess Highland thrived and became increasingly complex in the early Anyang period. When Anyang shifted its attention to the Northeast the network declined. and with the rise of the Guanzhong Basin in late Anyang period it finally collapsed. The argument is based on several lines of evidence: stylistic and scientific study of the bronzes themselves, analysis of relevant textual sources including oracle bone inscriptions, bronze inscriptions, and received texts, consideration of site distributions based on the pottery data from Shanxi and Shaanxi as well as systematic data that were collected during a survey of Shilou County in Shanxi by the author.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,Art and Archaeology,Art and Archaeology,"Archaeology, History, Bronzes, China, Loess highland, Trading network",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

Ferguson (1866-1945), lived in China from 1887 through 1943, working as a Methodist missionary, government adviser, and dealer, scholar, and collector of Chinese art. How Ferguson affected and was affected by changing definitions of Chinese art throughout those five decades is the primary question of this dissertation. My exploration of Ferguson's association with China's political and cultural elite, critical to his access to art objects, simultaneously reveals the cosmopolitan nature of late nineteenth and early twentieth century China, and the active role played by late Qing collectors and Republican-era archeologists in transmitting Chinese things and knowledge about them to the West. In the first decade of the twentieth century, through his association with Duanfang, Ferguson was introduced to jinshi scholarship. this vibrant culture of antiquarianism would profoundly influence his future collection of ancient bronzes and pottery, calligraphy and rubbings. In the same period, Ferguson made his first contributions to a Western dialogue on Chinese art as a member of Shanghai's North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. In the 1910s, the contacts Ferguson had established among Peking collectors, including Wanyan Jingxian and Jin Cheng, allowed him to become an effective dealer of Chinese art for museums in the United States. Ferguson bought for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and Charles Freer, among others. The confluence of American demand for and limited knowledge about Chinese paintings and objects, and the increased availability of these things, was also critical to Ferguson's success. Ferguson's private collection, donated in 1934 to the University of Nanking (now Nanjing University), manifests the value the foreign collector placed on his connections with renowned collectors of his own and earlier generations. The newly excavated objects that Ferguson acquired in the 1920s and 1930s also reveal his engagement with modern archeology in China and his interaction with scholars such as Ma Heng, who contributed to the emerging field. In his English language publications, Ferguson argued in cultural nationalist terms that China's autochthonous culture was the basis of Chinese art. His theory was intended to disprove Western opinion that Chinese things were not fine art, and to challenge Ernest Fenollosa's condemnation of literati painting. As archeological discoveries rapidly altered Chinese and Western knowledge of China's past, however, Ferguson was not able to thoroughly integrate the new finds into his narrative. The most lasting of Ferguson's books have proven to be his Chinese language indexes of recorded paintings and bronzes, accomplished with the help of the multi-generational circle of associates that this resident scholar cultivated in Peking.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Fine arts, Art history, China, Ferguson, John C., Jinshi, Qing dynasty",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304260543,"Sun, Zhixin",Jades of the Liangzhu culture,Ancient,"Recent advances in Chinese archaeology have brought to light a number of neolithic cultures that produced carved jades. Among them the jade industry of the Liangzhu culture, whose origin dates from the fifth millennium scB.C., was the most prominent. The Liangzhu culture arrived at a period of fluorescence in the first half of the third millennium scB.C., when unprecedentedly large quantities of refined jades were produced and surface decoration grew increasingly more sophisticated. These jades provided a source of inspiration for contemporary jade industries and had far-reaching influence on later cultures. This study attempts to provide an interpretation of the evolution of the surface decoration of Liangzhu jades and the typological transformation of major jade shapes. At the same time it responds to other related issues such as the material sources and jade working techniques. The discussion then moves on to explore more generally the relationship between Liangzhu jades and those of contemporary cultures as well as the contribution of Liangzhu jades to artistic traditions of later times.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Art History, Archaeology, History, China, decorative art",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304428858,"Liu, Cary Y.",The Ch'ing dynasty Wen-yuan-ko imperial library: Architecture and the ordering of knowledge,Modern,"In Chinese architecture, an edifice is judged beautiful not only by its outward form, function, or structure, but even more by its underlying symbology, which is often embodied in a building's name, numerology, decoration, and design prototypes. One may even go so far as to posit that a building's symbology is its mark of authenticity. This thesis examines the Chinese conception of architectural symbology and its connection to the imperishable word. Knowledge is recorded in writings, and is ordered in libraries. In the Ch'ing dynasty Ssu-k'u ch'uan-shu OOOO, the largest book compilation ever produced in dynastic China, the library books and halls came to manifest imperial ritual. The 1776 Wen-yuan-ko XOO library in the Forbidden City, Peking, was specially constructed to house the chief set of the Ssu-k'u books. Contrasting this hall's ideal design with its built reality affords a unique opportunity to observe the close interaction between architecture and imperishable words. It is commonly asserted that the timber-frame Wen-yuan-ko imitates the Tien-i-ko private library in southern China. Even imperial records cite this connection, yet a comparison of the two buildings reveals differences. Moreover, imperial libraries and archives in the late Ming and early Ch'ing were predominantly built of masonry for fire protection. The return to a timber-frame typology, thus, represents a significant reversal. The differences between the Wen-yuan-ko and Tien-i-ko library halls, and the return to a timber-frame library type, can be explained by the need to accommodate the ritual functions of an imperial library, palace building regulations, and architectural and institutional typologies for library halls and their agencies. The Wen-yuan-ko hall design also had to conform to the dictates of the bibliographic ordering of knowledge implicit in the Ssu-k'u ch'uan-shu compilation. For this study, Ch'ing imperial archives and statutes, private accounts, building documents, and modern building surveys of the Wen-yuan-ko hall allow us to reconstruct the hall as it was actually erected. Prior to the beginning of construction, however, imperial building records and poems for the Ssu-k'u halls specify an ideal design whose symbology was tied to the bibliographic order of the Ssu-k'u books and concerns for dynastic authority. Discrepancies between the ideal and actual designs can be traced to imperial building codes, provisions for imperial ceremonies, and to a long-standing imperial library typology with roots as early as the Northern Sung dynasty Tai-ch'ing-lou XOO library as seen in a surviving painting and written descriptions.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Art History, Architecture, History, China, library",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
250332509,"Barbieri-Low, Anthony Jerome",The organization of imperial workshops during the Han dynasty,Ancient,"From the earliest period of dynastic rule in China, specialized groups of artisans under official control supplied the ruling house with luxury articles and weapons of war. The Former Han (206 BC–AD 9) is the first period for which we have sufficient information to study the organization of these artisans and their workshops. Chapter 1 details the macro-organization of Han imperial workshops—the position of state-run workshops and factories within the political, economic, and geographic structure of the state. It follows a narrative structure which begins by describing workshops within the palace compound and expands outward to discuss larger factories in the capital and provinces. Factories were established according to the dictates of military strategy and following such practical guidelines as proximity to raw materials and labor resources. Overlapping production units provided goods of different quality to different markets and prevented reliance on one source for vital products. Chapters 2–5 narrow the scope of investigation by selecting a single imperial factory, the Western Workshop of Shu Commandery, in order to study its micro-organization. Micro-organization is defined as the inner workings of a workshop or factory, encompassing all stages of the production process and their management. Relying on a critically selected mixture of inscriptional and historical sources, as well as technical and stylistic analyses of the lacquer vessels produced at this factory, it is argued that the artisans' labor was divided along very fine lines of specialization as part of a production process similar to the modern assembly-line method of mass production. Other mass-production tools such as turntables, pattern books, and standardized molds were used to produce thousands of nearly identical lacquer vessels on a short production schedule. As the factory organization became more refined, the quality of the artistic output declined. The factory management structure was modelled on the structure of the smallest unit of centrally-controlled regional administration, the xian “county.” Parallel to bureaus in the county government which managed various affairs such as law-enforcement and taxation, bureaus in the factory structure handled different media like bronze or lacquer.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Art History, Economic history, History, Artisans, China, Factory production, Han dynasty, Imperial, Weapons, Workshops",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

(Volumes I and II),Medieval,"In illustrating T'ao Ch'ien's rhapsody Returning Home, Li Kung-lin (ca. 1040-1106) created a series of images as art-historically far-reaching as it was unique to the late eleventh century. This study revolves around an early twelfth-century copy of Li Kung-lin's Returning Home handscroll in the Freer Gallery of Art, in which we behold (1) the importance of this subject to intellectuals of the late Northern Sung, and (2) the complex ways in which Li Kung-lin used past art to express his modern approach. Two later paintings show Li's strong influence, but indicate the gap separating him from followers. Chapter 1 summarizes the historical response to T'ao Ch'ien, culminating in Li Kung-lin's time. Chapter 2 examines literature of Li's Returning Home paintings. Some contemporaries paired his Returning Home with his celebrated painting entitled Yang Pass, which reevaluated its subject and the role of painting in general. By the end of the eleventh century at the latest, Returning Home was linked with the Yuan-yu faction. Two middle twelfth-century poems suggest that the subject embodied protest against the status-quo. though paintings of Returning Home in the Southern Sung court would have played a very different role. Chapter 3 discusses the Freer scroll, broadly characterizing it as a linear mandala which presents T'ao Ch'ien's progressive expansion within two separate realms: natural landscape and Confucian social web. The imagery and compositions that Li adopted in depicting these two realms were drawn from distinct pictorial traditions. Li was merging style with content. Li's followers converted his composition into a physical continuum, undermining his ideas. Chapter 4 interprets the early Yuan handscroll Kuei-chuang t'u by Ho Ch'eng as a copy of a no-longer extant twelfth-century work probably painted for the court, but displaying heavy indebtedness to Li Kung-lin's long handscroll composition. It is suggested that Kuei-chuang t'u's model was by a follower of Li working in the court of Emperor Kao-tsung.

305313190,"Lu, Hui-Wen","A new imperial style of calligraphy: Stone engravings in Northern Wei Luoyang, 494–534",Pre-modern,"This is a study of calligraphy's role in the construction and reinforcement of political and cultural values in early medieval China. It examines the ideological functions and calligraphic styles of a group of state-sponsored stone engravings in Luoyang, Henan, the capital of the Northern Wei dynasty from 494 to 534 C.E. Through a historical, archaeological, and stylistic reconstruction of Luoyang calligraphy, this thesis uncovers an ancient imperial tradition of Chinese art that has largely been overlooked in both traditional historiography and modern scholarly discourse, which have tended to limit the examination of calligraphy to its role as a vehicle for individual expression. The Luoyang stone engravings appeared after the Xianbei Northern Wei regime relocated its capital there in 494. They include nearly three hundred epitaphs unearthed from the official cemetery on the Mang Hills and dedicatory inscriptions in the Longmen Buddhist Caves. Puzzled by the sudden emergence of these stone engravings with their distinctive calligraphic style of geometric and tectonic structures, many scholars have speculated that this calligraphic style developed without any stylistic precedents, and have consequently forfeited further inquiry. Through careful contextual research and stylistic analysis, this thesis brings to light two major discoveries about the Northern Wei engravings. First, the distinctive Luoyang style of calligraphy was a revival and re-creation of an imperial style of writing from the Eastern Han empire (25–220). This new imperial style was the artistic embodiment of the political agenda of the Northern Wei regime as it sought political and cultural orthodoxy on a par with the contemporaneous, ethnically Chinese-ruled courts in Southern China. Secondly, state-sponsored Luoyang calligraphy underwent significant stylistic changes during its four decades of development, from 494 to 534, that reflected crucial transformations in Northern Wei politics and society. The case of the Northern Wei illuminates an essential function of Chinese calligraphy that hearkened back to ancient times and was sustained in subsequent dynasties: the use of calligraphy to implement political and ideological agendas. The revelation of this tradition, it is hoped, will help achieve a more nuanced understanding of the art of calligraphy and its role in Chinese culture.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Calligraphy, China, Luoyang, Northern Wei dynasty, Stone engravings",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304446428,"Lin, Li-chiang",The proliferation of images: The ink-stick designs and the printing of the Fang-shih mo-p'u and the Ch'eng-shih mo-yuan,Modern,"This study analyzes the compilation method and the content of two ink-stick design compendiums, the Fang-shih mo-p'u (The Ink-manual of the Fang Family) and the Ch'eng-shih mo-yuan (The Ink Garden of the Ch'eng Family), in late Ming China (the second half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth century). Two Hui-chou ink-makers, Fang Yu-lu (ca. 1541-1608) and Ch'eng Chun-fang (1541-after 1610) initiated new trends by decorating their solid inks with flamboyant designs. In order to record their unprecedented achievements and promote their ink-making business, Fang published the Fang-shih mo-p'u in 1588 and Ch'eng published the Ch'eng-shih mo-yuan in 1605. Both books feature hundreds of illustrations of ink-stick designs as well as commentary by the famous literati of the day. The editorial programs of these two ink-manuals reveal their origins as catalogs of objects, as well as the ambitions of their compilers. Ch'eng arranged his ink-stick designs in an encyclopedic manner to demonstrate that his ink-sticks could encompass the knowledge of the universe. He further proclaimed his pride as a successful merchant and ink-maker in many of his writings and in the illustrations in the Ch'eng-shih mo-yuan, where he portrayed himself as a literatus. These two books are the records of Fang's and Ch'eng's careers as ink-makers as well as documents of visual sources in the late Ming period, since many of their designs were adapted from different crafts, books, paintings and even Western images. By tracing the sources of these ink-stick designs and the influence they exerted upon later ink-makers and artists of other decorative media, we come to realize the active exchange of decorative vocabularies between different crafts in this period.

304615670,"McCausland, Shane",Zhao Mengfu (1254--1322) and the revolution of elite culture in Mongol China,Medieval,"This study aims to bridge existing histories for the artistic transformations of early Yuan (1279–1368) China, and a fresh understanding of the less tidy horizons of cosmopolitan Yuan culture that my research has generated. I address this concern by focusing on the production and milieux of the pivotal figure in the Yuan revolution in art, Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322), a Chinese aristocrat and poly-math, statesman, and favourite of Khubilai khan. By relating each experimental stage of Zhao Mengfu's transfiguration of nature, and his reforms of calligraphy and painting to historical and social contingencies, I aim to recover something of the society and ideology of pictorial art at this most significant juncture. Mine is a long overdue attempt to complicate our understanding of these changes. The reunification of China under Mongol rule in 1279 precipitated massive canonical reforms in art, and coincided with the eclipse of mimetic aesthetics by a transformation of the medium into a self-critical device. Central to this thesis is my reading of Zhao Mengfu's art as a leading corrective in this process. Initially, I investigate the hermeneutic art of calligraphy as an informative paradigm in elite pictorial art. This provides grounds for recounting what I see as the inscribing of this discipline into the art of painting. Then, I explore tensions evident in Zhao Mengfu's art between Song (960–1279) representational aesthetics, medieval symbolist aesthetics—which he recovered through collecting and connoisseurship—and the abstract moral aesthetics of calligraphic brushwork. I see Zhao's later paintings as drawing authority not from nature, but from the act of redefining the past through isometric recreations of the old masterworks that he canonised in colophons. at the same time they were reflexive ideological statements on his own predicament as a Chinese cultural leader in a government of occupation. I regard the impulses to represent thought and action as the visual initiatives in Zhao's art—whether the formal recoding of sagely calligraphic models (chapter I). the transformation and abstraction of the pictorial surface in figure and animal painting (chapter 2). self-enrichment via stylistic reinvention in landscapes (chapter 3). or the devotional exercises in the intelligentsia's signature genre “Old Tree, Bamboo &amp.

304221567,"Kent, Richard Kellogg",The sixteen lohans in the pai-miao style: From Sung to early Ch'ing,Medieval,"Chapter 1 surveys the worship in China of the sixteen lohans--enlightened disciples of the Buddha entrusted with guarding the Buddhist law until the advent of Maitreya, the Buddha of the future. Cultic worship of the lohans flourished toward the end of the ninth century, inspiring their depiction in painting and, presumably, sculpture. Strongly iconic, the earliest, extant representations follow two models: one that presents them with sinicized features in the manner of contemporary portraits of Chinese patriarchs, and one that emphasizes their foreignness in the manner of earlier, imaginary portraits of legendary Indian disciples--especially Mahakasyapa--that had been produced in China since the Six Dynasties period. Focusing on the only surviving handscroll attributed to the monk-painter Fan-lung (d. before 1187), Chapter 2 examines the rise of the depiction of lohans in the pai-miao style during the late eleventh and twelfth centuries. Along with the choice of a style that was distinctly associated with late Northern Sung literati culture, there occurs a marked change in the iconography. In Fan-lung's painting the lohans are presented as dignified Ch'an abbots in garden-like settings and engaged in scholarly, contemplative pursuits. The iconographic change, much informed by the genre of Ch'an patriarchal portraiture, reflects the institutional prominence gained by the Ch'an school during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Fan-lung's approach to depicting the lohans, which also incorporates elements from genres of secular painting, offers visual evidence of the increasingly public and multi-faceted identity of the Ch'an school at this time. Chapter 3 examines the continuation of the Sung-derived tradition of pai-miao lohan painting as it was revived during the late Ming and early Ch'ing periods. The chapter focuses on works by Ting Yun-p'eng and Shih-t'ao. Both of these artists' lives and careers were profoundly shaped by the widespread renewal of Buddhism, and particularly the Ch'an school, that began during the Wan-li period and lasted well into the Ch'ing period. I argue that the achievement of these two artists in painting lohans in the pai-miao style cannot be separated from their identities as Buddhist adherents.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Religious history, Buddhism, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304615281,"McIntire, Jennifer Noering",Visions of paradise: Sui and Tang Buddhist pure land representation at Dunhuang,Medieval,"The hope for rebirth in paradises became a powerful goal for many Chinese Buddhists in the sixth century. The practice of visualization, a meditative method to attain such rebirth, became increasingly popular as did artistic representations of Buddhist paradises. The growing interest in these paradises corresponded with the development of three-dimensional, illusionistic representation in Chinese pictorial art. At the Mogao complex near Dunhuang in northwest China there is a continuous visual record of Buddhist cave-temple decoration spanning the fifth through the thirteenth centuries. This dissertation explores and documents the complex relationships among figural, architectural, and landscape elements that together produce convincing three-dimensional, spatial representations. I propose that this development of illusionism in painting at Dunhuang was closely linked to the Buddhist meditative practice of visualization in which the practitioner mentally constructed an eidetic image of a specific object or scene. The pure land paintings at Dunhuang are also related to sutras that both describe the wonders of paradisiacal worlds and prescribe visualization practices. The changing conventions of these practices can be seen in concrete form in the paradise programs of the Sui and Early Tang cave-temples at Dunhuang. The rapid development of pictorial skills necessary to depict a spatial environment reflects an intention to present these paradises as both enticing and attainable as well as a significant alteration in the way visual perception was represented.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Religious history, Buddhist, China, Dunhuang, Paradise, Pure land, Sui, Tang",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

Instead of sanctifying the contemporary imperial clans as did the Tang and Song pantheons, the late Quanzhen pantheon glorifies its own patriarchs. The connection between the Daoist pantheon and imperial ancestry established from the Tang onward was severed during the Yuan because the Mongol rulers, as foreign conquerors, had neither the necessity nor the possibility to claim ancestry in the pantheon of the native Daoist religion. Unlike the Chinese Buddhist pantheon whose thearchy and theogony remained relatively stable, the Daoist pantheon was frequently rejuvenated to meet both the religious and political needs of changing situations.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Art History, Religious history, History, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
1558887782,"Brightwell, Erin Leigh","The Mirror of China: Language selection, images of China, and narrating Japan in the Kamakura period (1185-1333)",Medieval,"Kara kagami (The Mirror of China) is something of an enigma—only six of an original ten scrolls survive, and there is no critical edition with comprehensive annotation or previous translation. A work composed for Imperial Prince-cum-Shogun Munetaka by the scion of a distinguished line of Confucian scholars, Fujiwara no Shigenori, on a topic of pressing interest in the thirteenth century—the fate of Continental China—it embodies many of the characteristic concerns of Kamakura Japan. Tensions between privatization and circulation of learning, imperial and warrior authority, Japan's envisioning of China and her relations thereto, as well as a larger cosmological narrative all run through the work. Yet they do so ways that challenge now long-held ideas of language, stance towards the Continent and its traditions, and narratives of generic development and resistance. This dissertation explores the ways in which The Mirror of China defies familiar-yet-passé conceptions of medieval Japan. It examines afresh how three issues in medieval discourse—language selection, portrayals of China, and narrating Japan—are refracted in The Mirror of China in order to better understand text-based claims of political, cultural, and philosophical authority. The Mirror of China's linguistically diverse manuscripts invite question of the worldviews or allegiances of identity a multilingual text can intimate. Its depiction of China and the implied narratives such a vision creates likewise differ markedly from those of contemporary works. And lastly, the linguistic and thematic innovation it brings to the Heian genre of Mirror writing marks a previously obscured turning point in medieval historiographic writing, one that allows an appreciation of the genre as a medieval experiment in crafting histories as legitimating narratives. Drawing on multiple understudied works in addition to better-known writings, this dissertation provides a new understanding of how medieval thinkers exploited languages, images, and traditions in order to create their own visions of authority.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,East Asian Studies,East Asian Studies,"Asian literature, Asian History, China, Cosmology, Historiography, History, Japan, Kamakura, Language selection, Literature",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304446431,"Des Forges, Alexander Townsend",Street talk and alley stories: Tangled narratives of Shanghai from Lives of Shanghai Flowers (1892) to Midnight (1933),Contemporary,"Novels set in Shanghai first appeared in the 1890s and flourished for more than three decades. This dissertation investigates the complex links between narrative form and the practice of reading in these novels, raising questions about the relationship between literary texts and their means of production, and challenging the distinctions conventionally drawn between modern and pre-modern Chinese literature. In the first chapter, I outline the social context in which Shanghai novels appeared, describing the introduction of new printing technologies, high literacy rates, and rise of leisure time as social practice in nineteenth-century Shanghai. The second chapter delineates the Shanghai novel as a genre, noting first its uniqueness in setting, and second, its new mode of production: publication in installments. The third chapter analyzes the textual construction of space in three early Shanghai novels (Haishang hua liezhuan--Lives of Shanghai Flowers. Haitian hong xueji--A Shanghai Swan's Tracks in the Snow, 1899. and Haishang fanhua meng--Dreams of Shanghai Splendor, 1898-1906), examining the place of specific public parks, theaters, teahouses, and streets, and showing how the Shanghai of these novels differs from the Shanghai of maps and guidebooks compiled during the same period. The fourth chapter addresses the way in which narrative lines begin, interact and develop, and end in Shanghai novels, and shows how this management of narrative time constitutes a response to conditions of literary production specific to turn-of-the-century Shanghai. Finally, I explore the influence of these conceptions of city space and time on Mandarin Duck and Butterfly novels of the 1920s and Mao Dun's Ziye (Midnight). Previous readings of Midnight have presented it as heir to the nineteenth-century European realist tradition. I concentrate instead on its similarities to earlier Shanghai narratives and highlight the problematic aspects of approaches that find Mao Dun to be imitative of European writers. In the conclusion, I reveal the motivated aspects of my choice of genre as an analytical (and finally rhetorical) tool, and show how the selective and strategic use of categorical groupings can be a powerful technique for the critical reassessment of reigning paradigms.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Comparative literature, History, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304981727,"Ditter, Alexei Kamran",Genre and the transformation of writing in Tang Dynasty China (618-907),Medieval,"This dissertation examines the sweeping changes in the themes, rhetoric, and forms of prose writing that occurred during China’s late-eighth and early-ninth centuries. I argue that the literary innovations of this period reflect ways in which writers adapted their textual practices to rapidly changing material, social, and economic conditions. Over the course of the eighth and ninth centuries, new technologies for the production of paper significantly lowered the costs of literacy education and literary reproduction. Progressively more efficient and motivated systems of textual circulation allowed writers to address more diverse audiences faster than ever before. Finally, the evolution of public and private markets for literary products during this period opened new avenues for realizing financial gain through writing. Through close examination of patronage, official ritual sacrifice, and the literary marketplace, I demonstrate that these material, social, and economic changes profoundly affected mid-Tang literary practices. In cover letters, writers experimented with different ways of coercing prospective patrons to help them by making the addressees seem petty in the eyes of others should they refuse. Prayers for rain could be used to advertise the quality of one’s performance in provincial office, communicate social critique, or even send warnings to political enemies. And literary reputations could be traded upon to land lucrative commissions composing prefaces or tomb inscriptions for those desiring lasting fame. Through inquiry into how changing material, social, and economic conditions across the late-eighth and early-ninth centuries shaped and influenced textual practices, the dissertation contributes to contemporary understanding of a complex and innovative period in Chinese literary history and at the same time clarifies a methodological approach to understanding literary change applicable to the literatures of other places and times.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, China, Cover letter, Genre, Orisons of appeal, Tang dynasty, Tang prose, Writing",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
580129798,"Klein, Esther Sunkyung",The history of a historian: Perspectives on the authorial roles of Sima Qian,Ancient,"In the first century BCE, Sima Qian compiled the Shiji, a history of China from mythological beginnings to his own day. Soon after, readers of the Shiji began producing both continuations and extensive comments. This dissertation examines the changing ways in which pre-modern Chinese readers understood authorship through an analysis of their perspectives on Sima Qian. I argue that we cannot know the “real” Sima Qian: the tragic authorial figure of Sima Qian is a construction by later readers. I trace the development of this authorial construction from the Han through Song dynasties, examining readers' comments within their historical contexts. The dissertation has three parts. The first outlines Sima Qian's fortunes in the textual world of traditional China, exploring how his authorial role was seen in relation to the Classics and to historical texts (in chapter 1), as well as to literary theory and composition (in chapter 2). Chapter 3 discusses formal aspects of the Shiji and how they were considered an aspect of Sima Qian's creative authorship. The second part juxtaposes two competing interpretations of the Shiji. Chapters 4 and 5 analyze how Sima Qian's personal tragedy was thought to relate to his work on the Shiji . Initially such motivations were viewed in a primarily negative light. It was not until the Song that the autobiographical connection came to be valorized. In chapter 6, I consider an alternative position, that the Shiji was a “true record” and how the meaning of that term changed over time. I show how this aspect of Shiji interpretation reflected and influenced traditional Chinese attitudes toward history. The third part explores textual issues. In chapter 7, I consider three problems related to Shiji authorship that go beyond Sima Qian: the question of Sima Tan, the work of Chu Shaosun, and the idea of a damaged Shiji text. In chapter 8, I discuss issues related to the authenticity of the “Letter in Reply to Ren An,” which is often read as Sima Qian's finest autobiographical statement and a crucial interpretive key to the Shiji.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Medieval history, Authorial, Authorship, China, Historian, Reception history, Shiji, Sima, Qian",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304989416,"Du, Chunmei",Gu Hongming and the re-invention of Chinese civilization,Contemporary,"This dissertation investigates the life and thought of Gu Hongming (1857–1928), a cosmopolitan scholar who became a premier exponent of Confucianism to the early twentieth century Western world. In contrast to traditional historiography that portrays Gu as an ultraconservative nationalist, I problematize his “Chinese” identity and reinterpret him as a diasporic and transnational figure, taking into account Gu's childhood experience in colonial Malaya and higher education in Victorian Britain. My dissertation focuses on two questions. First, how did Gu reconstruct an “authentic Chinese” identity when China was undergoing a transition from empire to nation-state? Second, how did he emerge as a representative of “the East” by reinterpreting and propagating Chinese culture to Western audiences in the post-World War I era? Using Gu as a case study, my project further examines two transnational networks that I term “diasporic Chinese professionals” from Southeast Asia, and “spokesmen for the East” from China, Japan, India, and Russia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. I draw on a wide variety of sources, including periodicals, government documents, school records, literary writings, and personal diaries from national and private archives in China, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and Scotland. These materials reveal the diverse experiences and hybrid identities of overseas Chinese and underscore the ambiguity of the concept of “Chineseness” during this transitional period. Moreover, I highlight the roles played by Gu and other representatives of “the East” in transforming Western anti-modern discourse by incorporating anti-Orientalist critiques. The irony is that these same intellectuals could not escape the very Orientalist paradigms that they opposed, given the rootedness of their thinking in Western conventions. My dissertation thus provides a concrete example of how intellectuals from “the East” struggled in a problematic relationship with Western cultural traditions and contemporary trends. I propose a new framework that brings diasporic and cosmopolitan scholars back into the center of modern Chinese history. Through highlighting the multivalent values and hybrid identities of these “cultural amphibians,” I not only challenge some prevailing dichotomies such as “Chinese versus Western” and “traditional versus modern,” but also expand the scope of the field of Chinese cultural history.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Philosophy, China, Chinese diaspora, Chinese identity, Civilization, Confucianism, Cultural amphibians, Gu, Hongming, Spokesmen for the East",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304446238,"Ji, Xiao-bin",Conservatism and court politics in northern Sung China: The thought and career of Ssu-ma Kuang (1019-1086),Medieval,"This dissertation provides a new interpretation of Ssu-ma Kuang's conservatism and analyzes his career in relationship to Northern Sung politics. Ssu-ma Kuang's conservatism was characterized by a reverence for the wisdom of the past and an urge to preserve past achievements. For him, deviations from established practice were potentially dangerous and could be effected only with utmost caution. To preserve the hard-won peace and stability of the empire for everyone's benefit, the ruler should secure the hierarchical system and focus on the most essential task of government: personnel management. Since the resources of the empire were limited, the government should limit its expenditures in order to prepare for emergencies and to lower its burden on the people. Ssu-ma Kuang's political career points to a general phenomenon in Sung politics at his time: The rulers were constantly trying to strengthen or maintain their control over government. Their main tool for this purpose was a system of checks and balances among officials. Second tier court officials, especially remonstrance officials, never wanted top administrators to grow too powerful. Consequently, the ruler could maintain control simply by letting power struggles occur. When both sides appealed to imperial support, the emperor's position was strengthened. Ssu-ma Kuang enjoyed his rulers' trust because he always defended the interest of the throne. In court politics, he often strengthened imperial power by counter-balancing the influence of the most powerful ministers. Ssu-ma Kuang's conservatism motivated his opposition to Wang An-shih's famous New Policies. Although Emperor Shen-tsung supported these policies enthusiastically, he still trusted Ssu-ma Kuang and tried to promote him to important offices. For this reason, anti-reformers looked upon him as their greatest hope to convert the emperor to their side. At the end of his life, Ssu-ma Kuang abandoned his conservative caution to abolish the New Policies. Yet, his actions were still motivated by his old views on the proper role of government.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Biographies, History, China, Conservatism, Court politics, Ssu-ma Kuang, Sung Dynasty",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
865035898,"Sela, Ori","Qian Daxin (1728–1804): Knowledge, identity, and reception history in China, 1750–1930",Medieval,"This study focuses on the eighteenth-century polymath Qian Daxin. Qian's peers regarded him as the greatest scholar of their dynasty, yet during the twentieth century Qian Daxin was marginalized. I argue that in order to understand Qian Daxin, as well as the reasons for his marginalization, we need to analyze the nexus of knowledge and identity, and do so according to the terms of the historical actors, not according to anachronistic, and foreign, categories imposed on the actors. This nexus of knowledge and identity has had bearing on the ways Qian Daxin thought of his scholarship, on the contents of his studies, as well as on the history of his reception in the two centuries following his death. In order to enter Qian Daxin's world I therefore begin with his biography, examining the social history of scholars during the eighteenth century via Qian's changing and intricate web of social networks. Through his scholarship on history, classics, and science (astronomy and mathematics in particular), I demonstrate how Qian Daxin thought about his own identity – mainly as an Ancient Learning adherent – and how this identity interacted with his notions of knowledge. I also shed new light on interand intra-cultural encounters (with Western Learning, for example) that were part of what Qian confronted. I maintain that Qian perceived an identity crisis, a crisis related not to political or economic anxieties but to the cultural identity of the Ru (“Confucians”), and reacted to it both in terms of scholarship and in terms of the dissemination of his scholarship. A sense of anxiety over the cultural identity of the Ru was not unique to Qian or to eighteenth century scholars. during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, similar anxieties, albeit stimulated by different circumstances, continued to be a significant factor in the shaping of Ru knowledge and later in the critique of Ru (“Confucianism”) as a whole. The question of what in the past, in history, a culture should remember and what could be forgotten, as well as how past events and personalities should be remembered, was influenced by such nexus of knowledge and identity. In my examination of the reception history of Qian Daxin I posit Qian's contemporary Dai Zhen as Qian's competitor in the historical narrative. The two competed already during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for “best Qing dynasty scholar” (Dai claimed to have won first place, others claimed Qian was the best). but Dai's twentieth-century victory was in totally new – modern and Western – categories, most significantly philosophy. My study problematizes the use of such categories, explores the genealogy of “philosophy,” and traces its journey from Europe, through Japan, to China. Similarly, the notion that Qian Daxin was part of a “Han Learning” group or movement, a notion that began in the early nineteenth century and persisted during the twentieth century, is reexamined and refuted. This study tries to present a more nuanced narrative of the intellectual history and historiography of the Qing and early Republican China, one that is more sensitive to the changing terminology, anxieties, and complexities of the period, through the person and image of a prominent yet hitherto unexplored scholar – Qian Daxin.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Biographies, History, Science history, China, Dai, Zhen, Identity and knowledge, Philology, Qing dynasty, Quin, Daxin",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

Radio first arrived in China in the winter of 1922–23, bursting into a world where communication was slow and disjointed, where less than ten percent of the population ever read newspapers—and these often took days or weeks to reach even relatively proximate locations. Just thirty-five years later, at the beginning of the Great Leap Forward, radio broadcasts reached hundreds of millions of people instantaneously, every day. Tracing the history of radio in China from its introduction in the 1920s through to the peak of Maoist totalitarianism in the Great Leap Forward, the project shows how radio transformed news, information, and governance. Trained radio monitors, posted in rural districts from the early 1930s onward, transcribed, reproduced, and redistributed news, information, and educational content broadcast from government stations. By the mid-1950s every county in China had such a monitoring post—most more than one. Thus, the project rebalances the story of the growth of mass media by integrating wireless and rural areas into a previously urban and print-centered narrative. While altering the flow of news and information, radio also coordinated mass mobilization campaigns, distributed government policies and implementation guidelines, and enforced compliance through shaming and public awareness of the ‘correct line’. By bringing central government movements and directives to rural areas where ninety percent of the population lived, radio technology reordered the political geography of China, creating the space for a reorganized and powerful Chinese state in the latter half of the twentieth century. In this way, the project reinterprets the history of the rise of mass politics in China; it should not be understood as arising from war, the introduction of party organization, or ideology alone. It must also be understood through the lens of technological development.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,History,History,"China, History, Media, Politics, Radio, Technology,",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
2130000018,"Peng, Peng","The Lost-wax Casting in Bronze Age China: Art, Technology, and Social Agency",Ancient,"The present dissertation adopts a comprehensive, thorough, and systematic approach toward early Chinese lost-wax castings. It first verifies that the lost-wax technique truly existed in Bronze Age China, and analyzes how it came to be used in each casting for which it is confirmed. After investigating the chronology and social context of the early lost-wax cast bronzes, it finally looks for the technological origin and artistic driving force of the lost-wax casting in Bronze Age China. As this dissertation shows, the dominant belief that lost-wax is the optimal method for metal casting, and its arrival was an earthshaking development, deserves more rigorous examination. In a broader sense, the dissertation provides a study on the concept of “norms,” which many historians and art historians constantly rely on, but seldom question or clarify. If we accept the lost-wax process as the norm in casting, early Chinese metalworkers must be regarded as favoring an inferior technology. By revealing the picture that Chinese founders often chose not to use the lost-wax process they had clearly mastered, the dissertation refutes the idea that lost-wax is the only “right way” to cast bronzes. This research aims to show that a “norm” is in many ways a misconception that twists our comprehension of art, technology, civilization, and history.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,Art and Archaeology,Art and Archaeology,"Communication and the arts, Social sciences, Bronze age china, Lost-wax casting, Openwork interlace, Origin, Section-mold casting, Technological variations,",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304836438,"Shan, Lianying",Narrating the colonial past in Manchuria and Shanghai in postwar Japanese literature,Contemporary,"This study explores how postwar Japanese literature narrates and recreates Japanese experiences in colonial Shanghai and Manchuria in the 1930s and the early 1940s. In postwar Japan, memories of the imperial and war periods have been suppressed. While postwar literature provides a discursive space for reconstructing individual experiences in the colonies, it forms a complicated relationship with the discourse of amnesia. This study thus examines the multiple ways in which narratives about Manchuria and Shanghai engage with colonial amnesia in postwar Japan. This project also demonstrates that individual identity and subjectivity are constructed through the dynamic interactions between amnesia and the counter-narrative to amnesia. I focus on five important postwar Japanese writers, who all lived in Manchuria or Shanghai before the end of the war, and who all wrote fiction based on their lives in the colonies. These authors are Takeda Taijun, Abe Kōbō, Kiyooka Takayuki, Miki Taku, and Hayashi Kyōko. Their writings on Manchuria and Shanghai span the late 1940s to the early 1980s. The Introduction maps out the historical and conceptual framework of the study. Chapter One discusses Takeda Taijun’s Shanghai narratives. His literature explores individual war guilt and responsibility in China as the reference for constructing Japanese individual subjectivity after the war. Chapter Two examines how Abe Kōbō uses the image of Manchuria as an alternative way to critique the national space, identity, and ideology of postwar Japan. Chapter Three analyzes Kiyooka Takayuki’s Dalian narratives and his celebration of the private space in relation to the colonial past. Chapter Four focuses on the ways in which Miki Taku’s narratives remember and recreate the Manchurian past from children’s perspectives. Chapter Five examines the interconnections between colonial memory and the memory of the atomic bombing in Hayashi Kyōko’s writing.

305413427,"Lin, Hsu-Ta","Reflavored nostalgias: A history and ethnography of Taiwan's muted marginality, 1895–2004",Contemporary,"This dissertation is an ethnographic study focused on the narrated memories of Japanese colonialism in Taiwan and the authoritarian violence of postwar Taiwanese history. It deliberates on how nostalgia is transformed into “sadness” for Taiwan's historical past and, simultaneously, beautification of people's colonial memories, thereby revealing transformations in cultural identification in contemporary Taiwanese society. Drawing on two neighboring gold-mining towns as settings for self-reflexivity and contemplation of historical and social change, the dissertation elaborates the diverse historical marginality and the consciousness of independent nationhood in modern Taiwan. Taiwan's cultural identification has been traditionally oriented toward Chinese historical and cultural hegemony, but this changing as the Taiwanese grow more self-reflectively aware of historical reality. This dissertation analyzes the film Beiqing Chengshi (A City of Sadness) and postcolonial phenomena such as the nostalgic fever for ekiben (train boxed lunches), thereby eliciting the nature of colonialism's impact on the hybridized cultural identity of the colonized. “Nostalgia” in contemporary Taiwanese society not only represents a movement of social consciousness that is expressed through recalling memories for the romanticized past, but also exposes Taiwan's identity controversy by juxtaposing the fifty years of Japanese colonial assimilationist policies with the subsequent Han Chinese ideological indoctrination program of the KMT. Such ideological re-hybridization typifies the marginal relocation of Taiwanese culture. This dissertation considers how the practice of traveling as a form of spatial mobility can probe a locale's colonized history and its people's feelings about their own past, and further reveals the contradiction inherent in searching for the vanished colonized past. The act of travel therefore represents not only the marginal history of Taiwan, but also the characteristic mobility by which the Taiwanese (re)localize themselves. The dissertation suggests that what travel and nostalgia refer to is not a specific historical period—Japanese colonization—but a free-floating past, for both shape the same images of authenticity and fictionality that are intertwined within people's remembrances. The Taiwanese have, therefore, come to a point of self-relocation at a moment poised between the repeated, marginalized past and an unknown, yet fervently imagined future.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, China, Colonialism, Marginality, Nostalgias, Postcolonialism, Taiwan",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304083481,"Wang, Fan-shen",Fu Ssu-nien: An intellectual biography,Contemporary,"This dissertation presents the results of a study on Fu Ssu-nien, a major leader of the May Fourth movement and a harbinger of modern Chinese historiography. This project has three objectives: (1) to reconstruct the major themes of Fu's thought, (2) to investigate his role in establishing a historical school, (3) to look into the collective experience of the May Fourth generation through an examination of Fu's life. From Fu's case we can see how youths of this generation responded to political turmoil, the Japanese invasion, and finally the victory of the CCP. Chapter I discusses Fu Ssu-nien's abrupt transformation from a conservative youth to a New Culture activist in 1917. After Fu's sudden conversion to the New Culture Movement, he was torn by many intellectual dilemmas and emotional contradictions. This chapter also examines the dilemmas and contradictions that tormented him. Chapter II describes Fu's study in Europe as well as some of his achievements after his return to China. In 1927, he introduced a hybrid of positivism and Rankean historiography to China. To put his ideas of historical and philological studies to practice, he founded the Institute of History and Philology. As the head of the Institute, he organized teams to open up archives, undertake anthropological investigations, conduct large-scale archaeological excavations, and engage in many other kinds of cooperative historical work. As a historian, Fu excelled in the history of Chinese antiquity. Especially important was his hypothesis of the plural origins of Chinese antiquity. Chapter III traces the formation of this theory and its influence. Chapter IV discusses Fu's study of the origin of ancient Chinese moral philosophy. According to Fu, his etymological studies proved that there was no introspective moral philosophy in orthodox Confucianism. Therefore he argued that the Mencian moral teaching was a betrayal of Confucianism. Chapter V shows how May Fourth ideals, such as iconoclasm, individualism, and objective historical study were seriously challenged in the wake of the Northern Expedition and the Mukden Incident. Chapter VI is a study of the laterday of a May Fourth youth. After the beginning of Sino-Japanese war Fu, in spite of his earlier vow to not talk of politics for twenty years, gradually gave up his early conviction and became involved in politics. He heroically attacked the prime ministers H. H. Kung and T. V. Soong for their massive corruption, and played a key role in forcing their resignations.

2310000026,"Chan, Ying-kit","Provincial Identity in China: Thinking Central-local Relations in Guangdong, 1870-1910",Contemporary,"This dissertation investigates Chinese impressions of Guangdong, the southernmost province of the Qing Empire (1644-1912), as an administrative or territorial unit, as a political concept, and—most importantly—as a source of identity. It interprets autobiographies, biographies, poems, literary letters, and political treatises as expressions of a new provincial identity informed by imperial decline, foreign ideas, and transcultural exchanges. By the beginning of the twentieth century, long before Guangdong would experiment with capitalism and economic decentralization in the 1980s and 1990s, its literati were already grappling with the issues of local autonomy, state control, and self-representation. By examining the writings of five literati who experienced China’s tumultuous transition from empire to nation—He Ruzhang 何如璋 (1838-1891), Deng Chengxiu 鄧承修 (1841-1892), Qiu Fengjia 丘逢甲 (1864-1912), Ou Jujia 歐榘甲 (1870-1911), and Liang Jushi 梁居實 (1843-1911)—this dissertation explores the historical context of the autonomy of contemporary Chinese provinces. It suggests that narrating a history of provincial identity and central-local relations outside the purview of statist and nation-centric perspectives can infuse fresh insights into tired historiographical and political credos about reform and revolution as well as provide an example that would supplement studies of nationalism of other parts of the world. Created in its current form during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1912) dynasties, Guangdong has developed a life of its own. It represents a locus for identity that is simultaneously cultural, ethnic, political, and personal. This dissertation thus focuses less on textual representations than on the personal inventions of provincial identity by selected Guangdong literati. Although marginal to the dominant discourses on state-oriented reform and revolution of their day, the vision of Chinese provincialism articulated by these literati accompanied the rise of ethnic Han nationalism. Through them, this dissertation explores the provincial roots of China’s national identity. It demonstrates how provincialism was fused with nationalist ideas in the late Qing Empire and has continued to influence debates on culture, history, and statecraft in contemporary China.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,East Asian Studies,East Asian Studies,"federalism, Guangdong, Late Qing China, localism, Modern China, provincial identity,",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
303727179,"Harrist, Robert E., Jr.",A scholar's landscape: Shan-chuang t'u by Li Kung-lin. (Volumes I and II),Medieval,"After earning his chin-shih degree the Northern Sung painter and scholar-official Li Kung-lin (ca. 1041-1106) took the unorthodox step of postponing an official career and retiring to a retreat in the Lung-mien Mountains of Anhwei province. The scenery of this retreat was the subject of Li's Shan-chuang t'u, a long handscroll composition painted after he had left the mountains and was serving in a low-ranking government post. This dissertation is a study of Li Kung-lin's painting and the complex network of cultural and artistic traditions within which it was created. Chapter 1 is a new biography of Li Kung-lin that concentrates on his career as a scholar-official. This chapter also demonstrates the importance of Li's friendship with Su Shih and Su Ch'e, who probably were the first to view his painting of the Lung-mien Mountains. Although Li painted both a draft and a final version of Shan-chuang t'u, these scrolls were lost long ago. They are reflected, however, in the six fragmentary copies introduced in Chapter 2, which presents a reconstruction of Li's original composition. Chapter 3 consists of two sections, a history of garden and retreat building during the eleventh-century and a scene by scene analysis of Li Kung-lin's painting. Chapter 4 argues that in order to interpret the pictorial structure of the landscape in Shan-chuang t'u, it is necessary to recognize Li's use of representational conventions seen in vernacular images, such as geomantic diagrams, and in narrative illustration. During the late eleventh century, Wang-ch'uan t'u by Wang Wei and Ts'ao-t'ang t'u by Lu Hung were intensely admired by Li's circle of friends. Chapter 5 examines the ways in which Li Kung-lin's allusions to these paintings by revered hermit-artists enrich the meaning of his Shan-chuang t'u. The conclusion summarizes the importance of Shan-chuang t'u for the history of later Chinese painting and, through a brief case study, demonstrates the far-ranging impact of Li Kung-lin's art among painters not usually considered his followers.",1989,1989,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Fine Arts, History, Biographies, China, Painting",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

(Volumes I and II),Modern,"The subject of this thesis is the Kangxi Southern Inspection Tour, a series of twelve long handscrolls painted by Wang Hui (1632-1717) and a group of assistants that documents the Kangxi Emperor's 1689 inspection tour of South China. Chapter I introduces the historical event that stands behind this painting. It examines the political context of Kangxi's 1689 Southern tour and summarizes how the tour was recorded in official chronicles. Chapter II describes Wang Hui's pictorial documentation of the tour in terms of the twelve distinct themes on which his painting focuses. It suggests how the idea for the painting came about, how Wang Hui was chosen to supervise the project, and what the political goals of the commission may have been. Chapter III treats the creative process: how Wang translated written and oral accounts into a coherent pictorial image. The chapter outlines a three-step process of visualization--rough sketches, a final draft on paper, and the finished version on silk--and suggests the types of pictorial sources Wang drew upon to give his painting a sense of topographic and iconographic accuracy. Chapter IV analyzes Wang Hui's artistic achievement. Through his integration of classical narrative and pictorial structures Wang not only elevated Kangxi's journey to the transcendent level of cultural archetypes, he achieved a major revival in narrative art. In deciphering the meaningful motifs of Wang's pictorial and narrative language, it is possible to reconstruct something of what the painting meant to contemporary viewers.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Fine Arts, History, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
275913169,"Brindley, Erica Anne",Human agency and the development of self -cultivation ideologies in the Warring States,Ancient,"This dissertation outlines a history of views concerning the relationship between individuals and idealized sources of authority in Warring States China (∼463–221 B.C.). It presents arguments for the development of two types of ideologies on the human agent: ideologies which support human obedience and conformity to a single, higher, external power. and ideologies centering on the individual agent as a powerful actor of its own. With time, this dissertation claims, the latter type of ideologies come to advocate the cultivation of certain universalized agencies inherent in all individuals. This important development is characterized by the emergence of a debate on hsing -human nature as an agency, or power of the individual. The emergence of ideologies that assume the universal power of innate human agency appears to be widespread. Later parts of this dissertation document varying approaches to the concept of innate human agency, attempting to provide the reader with a sense of how such a concept affected views on the scope of individual power in society. Also, in a general manner, this dissertation points to a likely connection between intellectual developments and the rise in social mobility, the transformations of the noble and shih -elite classes, and the growing centralization of power occurring at the time. Through an analysis of many diverse texts both from the received tradition and from tombs uncovered at Kuo Tien, this dissertation uses the theme of human agency to compare the views of Warring States writers across time and purported lineage affiliation. It is thus primarily comparative with respect to Warring States intellectual concerns and their sociopolitical implications. But this project is also relevant to America in the 21st century. Its analysis is framed so as to reveal and comment upon what we can learn from early China about our own, current discourses on human agency and notions of individualism in society.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Ancient civilizations, Agency, China, Individualism, Self-cultivation, Warring States",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
522161853,"Kelley, Sonja Jean","Printmaking in post-war Sichuan: Regional art development in the People's Republic of China, 1949-1966",Contemporary,"Government-supported artists working in Sichuan Province in the early years of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) used the medium of woodblock printmaking to create many of their propaganda images. These printmakers were known for their detailed monochrome prints and colorful water-based prints that took the daily activities of Chinese people, especially rural citizens and ethnic minorities, as a major subject. These artists worked in a Socialist Realist style modified by the influence of traditional Chinese painting, modern Japanese printmaking, and European Expressionism. The professional success of this group of printmakers can be attributed not only to the skill of each individual but also to the group’s effectiveness in promoting their prints nationally. This dissertation examines the historical conditions and stylistic sources that contributed to the development of printmaking in Sichuan during the period from the founding of the PRC in 1949 until the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Chapter One, “Historical Background and Artistic Context for Post-War Sichuan Printmaking,” provides an overview of the history of printmaking throughout China and in Sichuan in the 1930s and 40s and describes the modern print styles developed in the PRC’s various printmaking centers during the 1950s and early 60s. It shows both how Sichuan prints were similar to those produced elsewhere in China and also how they were distinctively different. It then examines the domestic and foreign stylistic influences at play in the creation of these post-war Sichuan prints. Chapter Two, “Effective Arts Management: The Development of Post-War Sichuan Printmaking,” details the history and organization of Sichuan’s major art institutions during the period from 1949 to 1966. It also briefly describes the biographies of the province’s most influential printmakers from this period and investigates their body of work. Finally, it analyzes the organizational and interpersonal factors that led to the success of Sichuan printmakers at the national level. Chapters Three and Four, “Depicting Southwest China: Rural Journeys and Images of the Countryside” and “Constructing a Multiethnic China: Visualizing the Ethnic Minorities,” investigate the role Sichuan prints played as propaganda, portraying the nation’s countryside and the ethnic minorities of China’s southwest to the rest of the nation. The prints supported government efforts to relocate urban youth to the countryside and promoted unity between Han and non-Han citizens. The conception of ethnic minorities that these prints conveyed became a fundamental part of the idea of the Chinese nation, and the power of this imagery and its value to the central government assured the place of Sichuan printmaking on the national stage. This dissertation examines regionalism in the modern art of China by studying an influential provincial site for printmaking production in the early years of the PRC. It shows how local officials and individual artists could create a space for distinct artistic creativity while remaining within the confines of national policies. This dissertation also provides insight into the role of the visual arts in constructing a modern Chinese multiethnic state. It analyzes how prints were used in Sichuan between 1949 and 1966 as propaganda tools to promote the Communist Party’s administrative approach to cultivating multiculturalism in China and managing the country’s urban-rural divide.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Art history, Art, China, Postwar, Printmaking, Sichuan, Woodcut",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
303824832,"Chapman, Nancy Elizabeth",Zhou Zuoren and Japan,Contemporary,"This dissertation considers aspects of the career of the Chinese essayist, Zhou Zuoren (1885-1967), related to his involvement with Japan and Japanese culture. It argues that Zhou's familiarity with and appreciation of Japanese culture represented a level of intellectual and emotional engagement with a foreign culture that was unusual for his time, but that this interest neither supplanted his attachment to Chinese culture nor blinded him to the bane of Japanese imperialism towards China. The study concludes by examining the fate that befell Zhou during the Japanese occupation, when he was branded a traitor for his conduct. The first chapter describes Zhou's childhood in China, showing how the declining fortunes of his family and nation helped to make him receptive to the influences he encountered as a student in late-Meiji Japan. The second chapter examines the growth of Chinese interest in Japan as a model for modernization and venue for overseas study, and chronicles Zhou's experiences as a student there from 1906-11. Chapter Three follows his emergence as a prominent member of the cultural community in Peking in the May Fourth period, and his efforts to acquaint his contemporaries with modern Japanese culture, especially literature. At a time when many Chinese intellectuals had discarded the Japanese model and turned increasingly to the West and the Soviet Union for inspiration, Zhou continued to argue that China could learn much from the Japanese experience of adaptation and innovation in the creation of a unique modern culture. This chapter examines his writings in this vein, as well as his strong denunciations of Japanese imperialism towards China. The fourth chapter treats Zhou's life in the 1930s, focusing on his increasingly gloomy ruminations about the nature of Japanese culture and the Japanese mind at a time when Japanese aggression and violence towards China was intensifying. The fifth chapter examines the events that led him to work for the occupation government during the Japanese occupation, his judgment by his contemporaries, and some of the questions that remain about this period of his life.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, Biographies, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
854862319,"Ching, Dora C. Y.",Icons of rulership: Imperial portraiture during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644),Modern,"At the beginning of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), life portraits of emperors and empresses followed conventions established centuries earlier during the Song and Yuan dynasties, and sovereigns were depicted in naturalistic, three-quarter poses. Continuing in this tradition, the first Ming emperor, Hongwu (r. 1368–98), was portrayed in a pose that emphasized three-dimensionality. In the fifteenth century, however, Hongzhi (r. 1488–1505), the ninth Ming emperor, was depicted frontally and symmetrically, centered within a monumental composition and seated on a richly decorated chair framed by a screen of painted dragons. He stares directly outward, nearly expressionless, with his body dissolved beneath robes decorated with cosmological symbols of rulership. This dissertation will examine the transformation of the imperial image from Hongwu to Hongzhi, arguing that the portrait of Hongzhi can be read as an icon of rulership. Through an analysis of the artistic concerns of imperial portraiture as well as the politico-religious context, I will trace the emergence of the iconic portrait of Hongzhi and attribute it to several factors: a new conception of the public function of imperial portraits, which ceased to be considered simply as objects of private veneration. the visual stimuli of Tibetan Buddhist icons, brought to the court in response to the early Ming emperors’ interest in Tibetan Buddhism. and the invention of a dragon robe that symbolized legitimate rulership. The combination of these three factors over nearly a century contributed to the creation of the new Ming imperial icon. After the establishment of the imperial icon, both imperial portraits from the late Ming and non-imperial ancestor portraits followed this new paradigm. In certain figure paintings, artists even eschewed naturalism to depict the emperor in an iconic pose whereas all the other figures were rendered more realistically. Imperial portraits from the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) similarly used this basic formula, incorporating new elements to suit the tastes of the Manchu emperors. The new Ming imperial portrait icon thus had long lasting effects in Chinese portraiture.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, Art history, Art, Asian, Art, emperors and rulers, China, Imperial portraiture, Ming dynasty, Painting",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
1734007330,"Hatch, Michael James",Qian Du (1763-1844) and the senses in early nineteenth-century Chinese literati painting,Modern,"The works of the literatus painter Qian Du (1763-1844) are examined in this dissertation for their particular use of sensuous allusion to secure social relationships. Qian Du was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the most renowned artists of his generation. But that generation has been overlooked by modern historians of Chinese art who have preferred to write about artists involved in stylistic and political revolution. A fundamental aspect of literati painting culture that those historical biases have encouraged us to forget is the role of the senses. As this study of Qian Du shows, literati paintings were keystone objects that secured social relationships within networks of elites in early nineteenth-century China, and sensuous allusion was a central tool for referencing the knowledge and experiences shared among those elites. Chapter One lays the groundwork for this argument with a biography of Qian Du followed by a historiographic critique of modern literati painting scholarship. Each of the next three chapters isolates a literati material culture with which Qian Du’s painting intersected and shows how painting could document the senses of touch, smell, and hearing experienced in the practice of those material cultures. Chapter Two describes the prominent theme of tea appreciation in Qian Du’s painting and the ways in which the fleeting fragrances, sounds, and tastes of tea could be cued in a literati painting. Chapter Three isolates the haptic qualities of the “archaic and awkward” brushwork adopted by Qian Du from the study of epigraphic inscriptions. Chapter Four describes the ways that Qian Du alluded to fragrances in his plum blossom paintings in order to describe the upstanding character of his fellow literati. Combined, these chapters draw from recent work on material and visual culture in order to redirect the insights of those fields back onto painting studies, unsettling it from myopic interests in stylistic precedents and avant-garde political messages by telling the story of an underrated artist and his depictions of the sensuous experiences of the early nineteenth-century literati world. The dissertation concludes by asking what a sensuous history of literati painting could look like.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,Art and Archaeology,Art and Archaeology,"History, Asian Studies, Art history, China, Du, Qian, Literati, Nineteenth century, Painting, Senses",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
1037064535,"Vance, Brigid E.",Textualizing dreams in a late Ming dream encyclopedia,Modern,"My dissertation centers on the meaning of dreams as interpreted by literati in the late Ming (1368–1644), viewed through the lens of the 1636 encyclopedia Forest of Dreams . This thirty-four- juan tome is the largest extant Chinese dream encyclopedia and includes nearly 5,000 dream interpretations, twenty-five nightmare exorcism and incantation methods, and a series of explanatory charts and graphs that depict the formation of dreams within the body. Forest of Dreams not only presented information on dreams, but also offered public access to a toolkit of esoteric knowledge employed by anonymous savants, or dream interpreters. Through a text-centric study of Forest of Dreams , I convey the ways in which dreams were transformed from private acts into public knowledge. First, by analyzing the contents and overarching organizational structure of Forest of Dreams , I offer insights into the assumptions its compilers held about dreams and about textual organization. Next, I analyze the motivations of the compilers and readers of Forest of Dreams and briefly address the question of audience and readership. Based on a reading of the encyclopedic section on dream exorcism, Forest of Dreams can also be simultaneously read as a scholarly endeavor to classify, systematize, and medicalize. I rethink the parameters of the term medicalize, pushing the category beyond the somatic to include the psychological, therapeutic, religious, and social. Finally, I illuminate the method of glyphomancy (the dissection of Chinese characters as used in dream interpretation), focusing on the shared, public knowledge of characters and the relationship between this shared knowledge and dream interpretation. Throughout the dissertation, I make a distinction between dreams per se and written, recorded, or textualized dreams. I maintain that the experienced dream is inherently inaccessible and intangible, albeit with residual emotional after-effects upon waking. Because written dreams were consciously produced and constructed, they reveal what their recorders believed about dreams. These textualized dreams transcended the individual, becoming shared, social dreams. Reading through layers of dreams also uncovers the existence of dream interpretation practitioners and the interesting overlaps between highbrow and lowbrow knowledge in early modern China.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, Book, China, Dreams, Encyclopedia, Literati, Ming",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
1622397627,"Shirane, Seiji","Mediated empire: Colonial Taiwan in Japan's imperial expansion in South China and Southeast Asia, 1895-1945",Contemporary,"Between 1895 and 1945 the Japanese transformed the colony of Taiwan into a regional center for southern expansion under the auspices of the Government-General of Taiwan (GGT). This dissertation explores how this process unfolded by focusing on the Government-General's interactions with other imperial institutions, the populations under its nebulous jurisdiction, and the peoples it sought to control through the production of ethnographic knowledge. By viewing empire through the lens of one strategic colony, this project demonstrates the existence of multiple imperial centers that possessed unique geographical and institutional imperatives. The GGT initiated imperial strategies that took advantage of its proximity to neighboring territories on the empire's edges. Due to Taiwan's geographical and cultural affinities with South China and Southeast Asia, it extended Japanese economic, cultural, and geopolitical interests across the East and South China Seas. Japanese colonial leaders mobilized Taiwan's institutions and personnel to economically exploit and later administer what would collectively become the Southern Region. Imperial ambitions in Taiwan, however, did not always align with those of the Tokyo central government. Rather, the GGT at times actively competed with the Foreign Ministry, Army, and Navy to shape Japan's southern advance. Japanese imperial ideas and practices thus did not solely emanate from the metropole but also from its colonies out toward extra-imperial regions. In addition to advancing Japan's trans-regional circuits of mobility and exchange farther south, the GGT pioneered Japanese area studies of the Southern Region through research institutions such as Taiwan's Encyclopedia Bureau and Taihoku Imperial University. Japanese colonial officials and scholars compiled ethnographic surveys to promote Japanese trade and investment in Southeast Asia's natural resources. They simultaneously formulated historical and ethnological narratives of commonality and connections among Japan, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia as cultural legitimacy for Japan's southern advance. Drawing on Japanese- and Chinese-language sources from Taiwan, Japan, and China, this dissertation illustrates how Japanese colonialists and Taiwanese subjects shaped Japan's relations with South China and Southeast Asia well before the Imperial Navy and Army's southern military advance in the late-1930s. Taiwan-based initiatives that advanced Japan's economic and cultural ties with, and knowledge production of, the Southern Region helped lay the institutional and conceptual groundwork for subsequent military occupation during the Sino-Japanese and Pacific Wars.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, Modern history, China, Empire, Imperialism, Japan, Southeast Asia, Taiwan",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
1036673457,"Li, Yaqin",Bandit suppression in Manchukuo (1932-45),Contemporary,"Manchukuo was a state that was established by the Japanese military in Manchuria (Northeast China) in 1932 and collapsed in 1945 with the defeat of Japan. Immediately after its founding, the Japanese Kwantung Army, later joined by the Manchukuo Army, initiated a series of bandit suppression( tōbatsu. ) campaigns to consolidate the new regime. This dissertation will focus on bandit suppression in Manchukuo as a means of illuminating the state's claims to legitimacy, its ability to mobilize at different levels, and the involvement of bandit suppression in other dimensions of state building. By examining how bandit suppression was perceived, represented, and practiced in the context of Manchukuo's state building, I will argue that the perception of the bandit problem and the practice of suppression campaigns in Manchukuo embodied the state's pursuit of legitimacy. Furthermore, the ideological, administrative, and legal construction of the state, as well the widespread mobilization of different groups of people in the anti-bandit campaigns also facilitated the state building process of Manchukuo. Through the lens of bandit suppression, I will suggest that the crucial concern of the state was to obtain legitimacy as the foundation of governmental power. Confronted with domestic disorder and the influence of Chinese nationalism, for Manchukuo itself to gain recognition and legitimacy for its continued existence as a state, it had to create a consciousness of its right to govern and the recognition by the governed of that right. Besides, to obtain legitimacy and consolidate state authority also involved the capacity of a political system to engender and maintain the belief that existing political institutions are the most appropriate and proper ones for the society. Therefore, the campaigns against bandits were often accompanied by the proclamation of the founding ideas of Manchukuo, including the principles of the Kingly Way ( ōdō. ), ethnic harmony, and bringing peace and order to the people. In this sense, bandit suppression embodied a state historiographic discourse about order, ordering, justice, and freedom.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,East Asian Studies,East Asian Studies,"History, Asian Studies, Modern history, Political science, Military studies, Bandit suppression, Bandits, China, Manchukuo, State building",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
1036669092,"Chiang, Howard Hsueh-Hao",Why sex mattered: Science and visions of transformation in modern China,Contemporary,"Amidst the disintegration of the Qing Empire (1644-1911), men and women in China began to understand their differences in terms of modern scientific knowledge. Why Sex Mattered provides an explanation for the relatively recent emergence of a psycho-biological notion of sex in Chinese culture, focusing in particular on the ways in which the introduction of the Western biomedical sciences had transformed the normative meanings of gender, sexuality, and the body in the twentieth century. This dissertation revises the conventional view that China has opened up to the global circulation of sexual ideas and practices only after the economic reforms of the late 1970s. Drawing on scientific publications, medical journals, newspaper clippings, popular magazines, scholarly textbooks, fictional and periodical literatures, oral histories, and other primary sources, this study highlights the 1920s as an earlier, more pivotal turning point in the modern definitions of Chinese sexual identity and desire. The evolving discourse of same-sex desire and the biologization of gender norms constituted two epistemological ruptures that complicated the shifting correlations of sex, gender, and sexuality in the Republican period (1911-1949). The extensive media coverage of sex change in postwar Taiwan epitomized the geocultural legacy of these earlier developments. Weaving together intellectual developments with social, cultural, and political history, this dissertation aims to accomplish three goals: it argues for the centrality of sexual scientific knowledge in modern China's cultural formation. it highlights the role of the body as a catalyst in the mutual transformations of Chinese national modernity and the social significance of sex. and, grounded in the historical-epistemological analysis of the vocabulary and visual knowledge of sexual science, it establishes a genealogical relationship between the demise of eunuchism and the emergence of transsexuality in China. This genealogy, above all, maps the underexplored history of China's modern geobody onto the more focused history of the biomedicalized human body. The isochronal evolution of China and sex, two constructs that seemed the most immutable of all, evinced the gradual decentering of the familiar frame of colonial modernity with Sinophone articulations in the course of the twentieth century.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,History of Science,History of Science,"History, Asian Studies, Science history, Gender studies, Body, China, Eunuch, Homosexuality, Sex, Sexology, Sinophone, Transsexuality",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

The production and sale of camphor on the world market impacted the livelihood of thousands of Taiwan workers, foreign and Chinese native merchants, Japanese industrialists in the colony and the metropole, and indigenous peoples who lived in Taiwan's camphor forests. It also affected the revenues of a provincial government and colonial state and the profits of a growing number of industries in Europe and America. The camphor industry operated on the borders of the Qing (1684–1895) and Japanese (1895–1945) colonial empires, enmeshed in the social, political, and economic structures of the island's frontier zone—an often violent, expanding zone of contact between state agents, Chinese settlers, and the indigenous peoples of Taiwan's central mountains. This dissertation examines the intersection of imperialism and capitalism at the center of frontier society through a study of the camphor industry. It aims to expand our theoretical and empirical understanding of the articulation between non-capitalist systems of political economy and emerging industrial capitalism in East Asia. I study the camphor industry on Taiwan as a site of political and economic struggle between foreign powers and East Asian empires, examining how both sought to gain and extend control over a natural resource whose end markets underwent a fundamental transformation from luxury good to industrial raw material between 1875 and 1920.

Knowledge of him is mainly drawn from the brief description in Huang Tsung-hsi's (1610-1695) Ming-ju hsueh-an (Intellectual biography of the Ming thinkers). This dissertation is an attempt to reassess Chou Ju-teng's position in the late Ming intellectual world, and then to use it as a means to re-evaluate Huang Tsung-hsi's characterization of late Ming thought. My dissertation deals with two different intellectual settings that are ultimately interconnected. One is the early Ch'ing period, where I have investigated why and how Huang Tsung-hsi came to choose Chou Ju-teng to carry out his agenda. the other is the late Ming, where I have investigated the intellectual growth of Chou Ju-teng and the people with whom he was associated. I try to explore the connections between their education, their social background and their official careers, and to identify their teachers, their associates and the literati circles they frequented. I seek to analyze the tensions and contentions that created divisions among them, and that sometimes led to heated debates. I also pay close attention to where they and their colleagues stood in relation to the power struggles going on in the central bureaucracy. This revisit to the late Ming intellectual world provides me with a basis upon which I am able to offer my critical assessment of Huang Tsung-hsi's views of late Ming thought. In this dissertation, Chou Ju-teng serves as a key figure who connects the intellectual setting of his day with that of Huang Tsung-hsi's. Reassessing his place in the late Ming intellectual world requires me to carefully examine the strategies Huang used to justify his interpretation of late Ming thought. My study shows that Huang's treatment of Chou reveals his attempt to remap late Ming thought in such a way as to spare Wang Yang-ming's (1472-1528) teachings from the harsh criticism by Huang's own early Ch'ing intellectual rivals.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
303615181,"Soulliere, Ellen Felicia",Palace women in the Ming dynasty: 1368-1644,Modern,"Historians of China have long found it useful to speak of a nei-t'ing or inner court, an inner circle of advisers which regularly took shape around Chinese emperors throughout the imperial era. The power of the various members of this circle derived from their proximity to the emperor and their consequent ability to influence his decisions. Of all the groups which belonged to this inner court, the women of the imperial household have been the least studied. The thesis provides an account of palace women in the Ming period, based on a comparative, chronological study of primary texts from the Ming and early Ch'ing dynasties. These include archaeologically excavated inscriptions, books written by and for imperial women during the course of the dynasty, works on ritual, official accounts of imperial women and unofficial histories. These sources are used to illumine the normative and ritually prescribed roles of imperial women and to investigate the practical questions of their selection and organization, the wealth and status which were conferred on their families, their literacy and their access to political power. The thesis describes the fragmentation of the roles of imperial women as a result of the Ming founder's instructions to his descendants on the selection of women for the palace and on the designation of the heirs to the throne. It argues that there was a direct, causal link between the Ming policy of recruiting imperial women from families of little social importance and the weakness of Ming imperial women in contrast to those of earlier and later dynasties. This policy, unique to the Ming, led to remarkably high social mobility, both up into and down out of the highest ranks of society.",1987,1987,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

This attitude reflected their general ideas about nature. This dissertation starts with an institutional survey of the pertinent governmental departments. The Imperial Observatory was the only unit officially allowed to carry out systematic sky-watching. Its staff are studied prosopographically. In terms of their professional work, they formed two groups: calendar makers and astrologers. Astral anomalies were traditionally a matter for the latter. In 1006 a guest star showed up in the sky and invoked enthusiastic discussions. The opinions of the court officials diverged. For the career officers, the meaning of star laid in the possibility of enhancing their positions by interpreting it tactfully. Scholar officials argued for paying greater attention on the principles of ruling the country. The opinion of the scholar officials is far-reaching. The meteor shower of 1038 marked its first triumph over the astrologically-oriented idea held by the career officials. The scholar officials argued further that the heavens were not an entity independent from human beings. Both were, instead, parts of the same universe. According to them, astral anomalies were at once warnings of the Heaven and the reflection called by impropriety committed by men in their mundane life. It would therefore be wise to concentrate on the human behavior instead of on phenomena high in the sky. The supernova of 1054 and the return of Halley's comet in 1066 revealed further evolution of the organic idea of heavens. The leading role of human beings in both the heavens and the mundane world was stressed in that, if the emperor and his staff could be decent and wise in running the country, and if they could behave in compliance with the moral principles taught by ancient philosophers, the Heaven would and should respond. Accordingly, the best way to tackle astral anomalies was to improve the administration of government. Astral anomalies became a problem neither astronomical nor astrological, but political. An anthropocentric attitude was formed.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

Chapter One analyzes the differing principles of the non-activist (or Huang-Lao) and the activist (or Confucian) stance as well as their textual points of reference. Chapter Two examines the criticisms activist officials made of the non-activist position, the different concepts of the role of the emperor in the decision-making process, the relationship between ruler and minister, and the inherent weakness of the non-activist stance. Chapter Three analyzes how these different approaches influenced the recommendations made regarding which economic policies to pursue and how the development of economic issues led to a shift to activist policies. Chapter Four examines the different proposals proffered to address foreign policy problems and the importance foreign policy debates had in bringing about a shift in political priorities. Chapter Five analyzes the power struggle which occurred at court between activist and non-activist officials, the reasons for the brief political ascension of activist officials, and the theoretical formulations of the activist concept of the relationship between ruler and minister. Chapter Six investigates the opposition to, and criticism of, this political re-formulation by non-activist officials at court, and in the Kingdom of Huai-nan.

304539633,"Lu, Yang",Dynastic revival and political transformation in late T'ang China: A study of Emperor Hsien-Tsung (805-820) and his reign,Medieval,"This dissertation examines the political and institutional transformations which took place during the reign of Emperor Hsien-tsung (805–820) of the T'ang dynasty. It not only provides a new framework for the understanding of the significance of some of the most important political, economic, and institutional phenomena during this period but also a sympathetic and dynamic picture of the T'ang society in early ninth century. Chapter one focuses on major aspects of Hsien-tsung's life, especially his accession, his relationships with members of the imperial family, and the mystery of his death. It interprets the eunuch involvement in Hsien-tsung's accession and in the context of imperial legitimacy and the bureaucratization of the eunuch system in the early ninth century. This chapter also challenges the widely held view that the Wang Shu-wen clique was a reform group. Chapter two deals with the process of Hsien-tsung's restoration during the first half of his reign. It argues that Hsien-tsung and his court consciously developed a new provincial policy during this period and enforced this policy vigorously and consistently. It also discusses the T'ang court's response to the economic crisis caused by deflation and its relationship with Hsien-tsung's political restoration. Chapter three focuses on different aspects of T'ang policies during Li Chi-fu's terms as chief minister, including factionalism, the Wei-po incident, and frontier policy. It argues that Li Chi-fu's leadership was a key factor for the political stability and success under Hsien-tsung. Chapter four studies the nature of the institutional transformations under Hsien-tsung. It challenges the notion that the rise of the eunuch power in later T'ang was a sign of political irrationality, and argues that the process of bureaucratizing the eunuch institutions was completed during the Yüan-ho era. Consequently, the eunuchs not only played a vital role in Hsien-tsung's political and military success, but also became less dependent on the imperial favor for career advancement. The very success of Hsien-tsung's institutional reforms increased the tension between the eunuchs and the emperor that eventually destroyed the political balance at T'ang court.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, China, Dynastic revival, Political transformation, T'ang Hsien Tsung",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
287982085,"Reeve, Michael Andrew Hall",Demonstrating the world: Mind and society in the Shuo Lin chapters of the “Han Fei Zi”,Ancient,"This dissertation presents a systematic examination of the long misunderstood Shuo Lin (Forest of Demonstrations) chapters of the two-thousand year old text, the Han Fei Zi . Set out in 71 tightly crafted vignettes, the Shuo Lin ranges in content from snakes who discuss the merits of subverting social hierarchy, to kings deciding on the proper timing of political assassination. The demonstrations given in the Shuo Lin guide and challenge the reader to master the interactions between what we see of the world, and what these appearances mean—to ourselves, and more strategically, to others. By providing a clear account of the content, rhetorical presentation, and historical trajectory of the Shuo Lin, my detailed study and translation seeks to re-establish a lost pedagogical link between the Shuo Lin and its readers, creating a work relevant not just to scholars of Early China, but also to students of sociology, rhetoric, and epistemology. I argue that the Shuo Lin is a sophisticated intellectual enterprise in which the properties of language, mind, and society are explicitly brought together to create a vision of meaning that is contingent upon the relationship between these properties, rather than deriving from a single property, or deriving from an objective realm existing apart from the knower. This dissertation situates the text within a more robust intellectual framework and overturns many currently held beliefs about the Harn Fei Tzyy . I dispute the efficacy of the widely accepted practice of reading the Han Fei Zi as an expression of the “school of thought” called Legalism, and more broadly I refute the assertion that unlike the Ancient Greek tradition Ancient China had little interest in or development of epistemological inquiry. The Shuo Lin shows us a world unanticipated, and uncommented upon, in the extant scholarship of the Harn Fei Tzyy , and unanticipated in modern Warring States intellectual history.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, China, Han Fei Zi, Mind, Shuo Lin, Society",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304221219,"Robinson, David Micheal",Banditry and rebellion in the capital region during the mid-Ming (1450-1525),Modern,"This dissertation examines the use and organization of force in early modern China through an examination of banditry and rebellion in the area around Beijing during the years 1450 to 1525. In this study, bandits are situated in a complex and ongoing process of negotiation in which brigands, local elites, civil and military officials, and central authorities all strove to advance their interests without riving the patronage networks that linked them together. The first two chapters lay out the political, social, and economic conditions that figured in the banditry of the capital region and the 1510 rebellion that began there. Chapter three examines the causes and patterns of banditry in the capital area, while chapters four and five are devoted to a detailed narrative of the 1510 rebellion, the largest Chinese rebellion of the 16th century. Chapter six evaluates the impact of the rebellion upon the capital region, highlighting the continuities in social organization, patterns of banditry, and government responses to the problem of armed violence. Taken as a whole, the dissertation clearly shows that banditry was an ongoing and prominent feature of society in the capital region during the mid-Ming. This study also strongly argues that the roots of this violence should be sought in the particulars of local society and further that the 1510 rebellion must understood in the context of this tradition of brigandage.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, China, Ming",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
252092371,"Abramson, Marc Samuel",Deep eyes and high noses: Constructing ethnicity in Tang China (618–907),Medieval,"This dissertation examines how written and visual texts in Tang China constructed ethnic identity. It uses sources from a wide variety of genres and covers a range of topics to analyze from different perspectives the relationship between Chinese cultural identity, Han ethnic identity, and the ethnocultural concept of the “barbarian” that was used as a foil for the other two overlapping categories. Previous works on ethnic heterogeneity in Tang society have assumed that the dominant trend was cosmopolitanism, accommodation, and ultimately the assimilation of non-Han peoples (“sinicization”) based on the understanding that ethnic identity in China was defined by cultural traits. This work, however, proposes that descent, geography, physiognomy, and political orientation were equally important in the discursive construction of ethnic difference and barbarianness by Tang elites, thereby altering our understanding of how identity was defined and the nature of Chineseness itself. Indeed, a central argument with significant implications for our understanding of how non-Han peoples functioned within the Tang empire is that the state and elites in many instances valued non-Han peoples because of their barbarian qualities, such as martiality, countering the accepted picture of Tang political elites as always promoting assimilation. This dissertation relies heavily on recent anthropological and sociological theories of ethnicity, though it is also indebted to the work of earlier historians of China working in both the classic sinological and Morganist-Marxist traditions. The body of the dissertation examines various genres and topics of Tang discourse—jokes and insults, stereotypes, Buddhism's foreign origins, physiognomy and heredity, clothing, non-Han as depicted in mortuary art, geographic thought, political loyalty, and migration—where the construction of ethnic difference played a central role. Although this study is far from exhaustive and provides only a foundation for the future analysis of the role of ethnicity in Tang social, economic, and political history, the wide range of subjects where ethnicity played an important role in structuring elite discourse, and, I would argue, popular behavior, points to the necessity of integrating evolving notions of ethnic identity and the nature of China itself into the various narratives of premodern Chinese history.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Cultural anthropology, Barbarian, China, Ethnicity, Han, Tang dynasty",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
1925518482,"Barish, Daniel","The emperor's classroom: Pedagogy and the promise of power in the Qing Empire, 1861-1912",Contemporary,"The nineteenth century was a tumultuous time for the Qing Empire (1644-1912). After endemic corruption and devastating wars at the start of the century, most scholarship on the late Qing highlights the role of local elites and regional interests leading to the fall of the dynasty. In contrast, this dissertation argues for the importance of the Emperor in the cultural and political history of the era. I demonstrate that beginning in 1861, the Qing Court worked to redefine the Emperorship, re-negotiating the bounds of political participation and re-conceptualizing the relationship between the imperial family and people around the country. These efforts helped to preserve the empire for fifty years after collapse seemed imminent. The Emperor’s education was the focal point of this project. From 1861-1912, a series of three young boys were enthroned as Emperor. Led by a coalition of Empress Dowagers and Princes, the Court established a discourse and set of practices linking pedagogy and the potentiality of power within the Emperor’s classroom. Scholars with divergent ideals of reform were promised the opportunity to mold the Emperor into an advocate of their vision of the country’s future, and the Emperor was promised the power to assert his will on behalf of whichever faction he favored. This competitive cooperation at the center counterbalanced centrifugal forces around the country. The power promised to both scholars and the Emperor were ultimately illusory, but the pursuit of that power sustained the Emperorship throughout the late nineteenth century. When the Qing began transforming into a constitutional monarchy in the early twentieth century, the Court presented the reeducation of the imperial family as central to the task. New schools and ceremonies surrounding imperial education sought to teach the Court’s subjects to be members of an emergent national community while assuring international powers that the Qing was adopting global norms of governance. The constitutional project thus invented an ideal of the Emperor as symbol of the nation. Multiple post-imperial governments attempted to capitalize on this idea, working to reeducate the ex-Emperor in new political ideologies and present him as an icon of their regimes.",2017,2017,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,History,History,"History, Education history, China, Qing Empire",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
761634246,"Lin, Hsueh-Yi",In the name of honor: Qian Qianyi (1582-1664) and the politics of loyalty in late imperial China,Modern,"This dissertation explores Chinese discourse on loyalty during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as it was produced in the contexts of Confucian revival, foreign conquest, and Manchu-Chinese dynamics. The aim of my thesis is a contextualization of the complex of ideas surrounding loyalty as exemplified in the fall of the prominent literatus Qian Qianyi (1582–1664), who cooperated with the Manchus during the Ming-Qing dynastic transition. This discourse on loyalty, I argue, evolved from historical and literary tropes into an ethical standard manifested in storytelling, history writing, and censorship. Subject to contention, these ideas were first employed by Chinese literati as an expression of their indigenous cultural identity and subsequently utilized by Manchu rulers in imperially commissioned historiography as an argument against collaboration with new conquerors. This study allows me to shed new light on the convergence of preexisting Chinese cultural values with the rationale of Qing imperial ideology. Loyalism, originally an anti-Manchu sentiment, ironically had been turned into a tool for the political consolidation of the Qing rulers’ control over the literati. The introduction looks into issues that surrounded the nuances of loyalty in late imperial China and it also analyzes the reception of Qian Qianyi in modern scholarship since the early twentieth century. Chapters One and Two examine Qian Qianyi’s life during the Ming in terms of his achievements in scholarship, his political activism, and his involvement with courtesan culture. Chapters Three and Four situate Qian’s life within the early Qing sphere of Ming loyalism and its impact on some aspects of the system of values, history writing, and religion. Chapter Five analyzes the available political options and historical contingencies during the early period of Qing takeover. Chapter Six describes early Qing remembrances of the late Ming, especially the changing attitudes toward Qian Qianyi’s reputation in different sources. Chapter Seven explores how ideas about loyalism circulated in between collective memory and historical records, and how they were taken over by the Qing rulers in the new historiographical category of Erchen zhuan (Biographies of twice-serving ministers) to condemn their Chinese collaborators at the beginning of the Qing.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Ethics, Philosophy, Political science, China, Loyalty, Ming loyalism, Ming-Qing transition, Qian, Qianyi",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
761622441,"Wu, Shellen Xiao","Underground empires: German imperialism and the introduction of geology in China, 1860-1919",Contemporary,"My dissertation examines the introduction of geology in China from the 1860s through the 1910s. The intersection and mutually reinforcing effects of science and empire form the focus of this dissertation, in particular the German attempt to corner the market on technical advisors in Qing industries and control the management of mineral resources in their Shandong colony from 1898–1914. I show in my dissertation that outside of the conventional narrative of science in Europe, geology developed in close connection with mining and the control of mineral resources. Valued mineral deposits during the period of my dissertation, particularly coal, became the battlegrounds of European and American powers and the Qing state and local elites. My approach reveals the complexity of the debate both at the center and the provincial levels in China, not only addressing the importation of science and technology from the West, but also the political and legal strategies to retain sovereignty and control over mineral rights. I show in my dissertation that when the first China Geological Survey began work in the 1910s, conceptions of natural resources, industry, and modern technology had already gradually shifted during the previous decades. I begin with the 1868–1872 China expeditions of the German geologist/geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen, proceed to consider the geology translations in the 1870s and 1880s, before exploring the role of German technical advisors in late Qing industrial enterprises. Finally, I examine the effects of foreign demands for mining concessions on the reforms of Chinese mining law in the 1900s, and the impact on the discourse of geology in the late Qing and early Republican period. Neither the introduction in China of Western science in general nor geology specifically was simply tied to history of science narratives. During a period of expanding empires and emerging nation-states, science offered one way to achieve a new ordering of the world. My work is a cultural history of how a new view of the state’s role in controlling the exploitation of mineral resources emerged during the late Qing period.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, European history, Law, Science history, International law, China, Geology, Germany, Imperialism",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
303848716,"Tsin, Michael Tsang-Woon","The cradle of revolution: Politics and society in Canton, 1900-1927",Contemporary,"In their search for the origins' of revolutionary movements, historians have often assumed an unmediated causal nexus between the social and the political. Motivations attributed to the populace are regarded as having sprung directly from their social experiences. In the case of the Chinese Nationalist Revolution (ca. 1923-28), the episode has often been depicted as a popular movement in which the masses were methodically and successfully mobilized by a committed political leadership, which articulated the anti-imperialist and class interests of the participants. The source of such a portrayal can be traced, of course, to the official representation of the revolution. By examining in some detail the history of Canton (Guangzhou), the base of the revolution, in the first quarter of this century, it is argued in this dissertation that the relationships between the social and the political within the movement were protean and ungrounded, and that the dynamics of the revolution itself cannot be fully comprehended in isolation from the formulation of its language. Instead of conceding to nationalism and social mobilization the adequate explanatory force needed to sustain the orthodox paradigm, it is asked here what the revolutionary discourses of anti-imperialism and class actually meant in relation to the social formations of Canton. The socio-economic transformation of early twentieth-century Canton is thus scrutinized. Of particular interest is the current concern among historians regarding the articulation of an autonomous space for civil society in late Qing and early republican China. How useful is it to posit a dichotomy between political and civil societies in China during this period? The question is dealt with in further detail in light of the efforts of the Nationalists and the Communists to forge a revolutionary base in Canton in the mid-1920's. It is suggested that their putative success at mobilization has been exaggerated. Rather the revolution had a certain momentum of its own, which was irreducible to any social essence. Indeed, the deployment of political discourses as an instrument of the revolution, that is to say, as a means to define rather than to reflect the revolutionary process, should be seen within the context of the considerable barriers encountered by the political elites in their organizational work. Much of our current sensibility with regard to twentieth-century Chinese history is still bound to the political language which first gained dominance in this period. By focusing on the specific process through which the notions of anti-imperialism and class became dominant discourses, it is hoped that this study will create a small opening for reflections on our understanding of modern China's historical trajectory.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, History, Political science, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304099920,"Wright, David Curtis",Sung-Liao diplomatic practices,Pre-modern,"This dissertation is a study of Sung-Liao diplomacy. It does not address the particulars of Sung-Liao relations but rather focuses on the modes of formal diplomatic contact between the two states. It is a history of diplomacy rather than a diplomatic history. With some qualifications, this dissertation accepts the proposition that Sung-Liao diplomacy was conducted on a footing of equality or diplomatic parity. It notes, however, that the Sung and Liao reserved exclusively for among themselves a more exalted body of ritual and rhetoric that did not apply to other states. The concept of an entire international community of equally sovereign and independent states did not exist in East Asia during Sung times. Sung China was not one state among equals but one of only two states recognizing each other as equals and regarding other states as tributaries or vassals. The Introduction argues that the multi-state system and diplomatic practices of Eastern Chou times were probably precedents for some aspects of Sung-Liao diplomacy. The Eastern Chou model of foreign relations was an alternative to the tributary framework of foreign relations that began developing during Han times. Chapter One outlines the military developments leading up to the Shan-yuan peace of 1005. It compares some provisions of the Shan-yuan meng or covenanted agreement with provisions of meng concluded during Eastern Chou times. Chapter Two examines the various types of embassies exchanged between the two states and describes the ceremonial for diplomatic audiences at the Sung and Liao courts. Chapter Three investigates the inner logic of the fictitious kinship relations between Sung emperors and Liao emperors and empress dowagers. It then presents a study and sample translations of Sung diplomatic missives to the Liao. Chapter Four is a study of the embassy reports (yu-lu) submitted by Sung envoys after their missions. These reports were essentially intelligence summaries and geographical descriptions of Liao territory. Over one hundred pages of annotated translation of these reports are included in Appendix One.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, Middle Ages, China",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304521423,"Shin, Leo Kwok-Yueh","Tribalizing the frontier: Barbarians, settlers, and the state in Ming South China",Modern,"This study steps outside the conventional frontier narratives of confrontation, accommodation, and absorption and incorporates them into a more fundamental one. It tells how as China expanded to the south in the late imperial period, the political interests of the state, the economic needs of natives and settlers, and the imaginations of cultural elites all facilitated the demarcation and categorization of the borderland population. Not only did observers classify people into either subjects of the state ( min ) or barbarians beyond its control ( man, i ), they also increasingly distinguished among the “barbarian” population. China's historical expansion is no doubt a history of colonization, but more fundamentally it is a story of differentiation and objectification—a story, in other words, of what this work refers to as “tribalization.” This study focuses on the practice and process of tribalization in Kuang-hsi province during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), a region which had long been claimed by the centralizing state but which had for the most part remained beyond its firm rule. It explains how as the Ming state sought to establish a greater degree of control over its southern frontier, it had to recognize and rely on an increasing number of native chief-tains ( t'u-kuan, t'u-ssu ) to maintain a semblance of order in the region. The story tells also how in areas where the state had sought to implement direct rule, it had to increasingly distinguish between settlements of registered, tax-paying min and those of unregistered, non-tax-paying man . Finally, this study explains how as more visitors traveled to the southern frontier in the late Ming period, many also came to differentiate in greater detail, for reasons both cultural and commercial, among the “barbarian” population. This study traces the practice of tribalization through the Ch'ing dynasty (1644–1912) to the modern period and argues that China's frontier history—and frontier history in general—must fundamentally be recognized as a story of differentiation, categorization, and objectification.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, Barbarians, China, Ming, Settlers, State, Tribalizing",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304260352,"Vankeerberghen, Griet",The Huainanzi and Liu An's claim to moral authority,Ancient,"This dissertation contains both a philosophical examination of the Huainanzi's views on morality and an historical investigation of the factors that led to the demise of Liu An, King of Huainan, and his kingdom in 122 B.C. It shows how in early Han times moral values, ideas about morality and historical praxis shaped and influenced one another. Part one argues that during the second decade of Emperor Wu's reign (r. 141-87 B.C.) a major shift in morality occurred. When Liu An offered the Huainanzi to Emperor Wu during an official court-visit in 139 B.C., he used the text to affirm himself as a person possessing both the practical expertise and the moral authority necessary to qualify as a player on the political scene. Officials whose primary goal lay in strengthening the grip of the central government over the empire, and who had risen to power during the twenties, sought to demonstrate how an independent moral stance was inherently disloyal. Around 122 B.C. they accused Liu An of plotting revolt and obtained a conviction. For the officials, loyalty coincided with submissiveness to the emperor's will. Part two shows that a reason for the officials' dislike of the Huainanzi is the text's refusal to articulate well-defined moral rules. How to act in a particular situation is up to the agent who has to rely on the judgment of his own heart. When an agent's heart is cultivated like the heart of a sage person, his actions will follow human nature and the hierarchy of values it contains and therefore be good actions. Part two further analyzes the Huainanzi's claim that persons who have cultivated their hearts according to the text's precepts are not only virtuous persons, but also extremely effective agents. Thus the Huainanzi puts forward pragmatic as well as moral reasons for why a person possessing the heart of a sage should be accorded a political voice. Even as the moral viewpoint that Liu An and the Huainanzi represent was condemned in 122 B.C., it retained its force as a vehicle for criticizing government practice.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Philosophy, China, Han dynasty",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

Carsun Chang, in the period from 1887 to 1949. As much as possible it attempts to use primary texts in a sequential manner to construct a chronological history of Zhang's political life. Zhang is best known as the author of the Republic of China's constitution. For two decades, he was also the leader of his own political party, the National Socialist Party (renamed the Democratic Socialist Party in 1946). In many ways, however, Zhang failed as a political actor. Like the other liberal figures of his generation, he was a reformist who shunned personal power, and never developed the military force or popular constituency needed to succeed in modern politics. To date, no Western study has examined Zhang's political actions or thought during the peak of his political career: 1943–1949. Other scholarship has not sufficiently addressed Zhang's writings on science and foreign relations or explored his political failings. I argue that Zhang inculcated many of the values, ideals and political norms and practices of his imperial scholar-officials predecessors. This inheritance both distorted his understanding of Western ideas, giving it a peculiarly Confucian tint, and hindered his becoming a meaningful political actor: for Zhang, the pursuit of power was always seen as a selfish act, unbecoming a public-spirited intellectual like himself",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Political science, Biographies, China, Political biography, Zhang Junmai",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304260722,"LeMond, John Gary","A history of Lutheran Theological Seminary, Hong Kong: 1913-1993. From isolation to ecumenicity",Contemporary,"In 1913, the Central China Union Lutheran Theological Seminary was founded in northern Hupei Province, China, by four Lutheran missionary organizations from Scandinavia and the United States. For thirty-five years the seminary educated Lutheran students for ministry in Lutheran congregations throughout China, managing to survive anti-foreign sentiment, warlordism, Japanese invasion and civil war. While far from the politically and socially turbulent coastal areas upon which the Western Powers were having the most influence, the seminary nevertheless felt the force of the revolutionary winds which were sweeping China. At the same time. although political and social change swirled around it, the Lutheran Theological Seminary found itself in a very secure position denominationally. Due to comity agreements among Protestant denominations, the Lutherans were protected from encroachment by other denominations within their sphere of influence. This situation changed drastically in December, 1948, when the decision was made by the missionary leadership to move the seminary to Hong Kong, in order to avoid being captured by the Chinese Communists. Temporary facilities were provided by the Christian Mission to Buddhists, a Scandinavian organization located on Tao Fong Shan, a mountain in the New Territories of Hong Kong. At this point the seminary was thrown into an entirely different world, far from the familiar surroundings of Central China. They were outsiders, and perhaps even more unsettling for the seminary and the churches it represented, they found themselves in competition with scores of other Protestant groups which had also found refuge in Hong Kong. Over the intervening forty-five years, the seminary struggled to come to terms with this new reality and create a new, more ecumenical self-identity. Today, the Lutheran Theological Seminary, Hong Kong, educates Chinese students from various denominations, from throughout Southeast Asia. A narrative history of the seminary, tracing the ecumenical development of the institution and based primarily on documentary sources, this study shows that the Lutherans in China and Hong Kong struggled constantly to balance their identity as a confessional body and their place in the larger body of Christ. to react to and make sense of the historical developments that were molding the China area. and to create a theological institution that reflected these realities. While the vast majority of the seminary's history was dominated by Western mission agencies, this study points out that the school's survival was insured only after Chinese leadership was installed, and a distinctly Chinese concept of ecumenism was allowed to operate. Rather than relying solely on Western concepts of ecumenism, the Chinese found unity in their ethnic identity, which transcended the conciliar/evangelical divisions that historically have defined the ecumenical movement.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Religious congregations, Religious education, Education history, China, Lutheran Theological Seminary, Hong Kong",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

The steamship was a technology brought to China by foreigners intent on economic expansion, and not only became part of the treaty system, but also part daily life in the Yangzi Valley, carrying both Chinese passengers and Chinese cargoes for domestic consumption. This dissertation examines the steamship on the Yangzi River—from the opening of the river to foreign trade in 1860 to the Japanese invasion of the river valley in 1937—as a site from which to examine the semicolonial system in nineteenth and twentieth century China and to open it up to further empirical and theoretical inquiry. Using primarily Chinese and British archival and bibliographic sources, the dissertation focuses on the steamship's evolving role in semicolonial politics and its role as a semicolonial social space. The first three chapters trace the history of a network of steam communication in China forged through struggles between the Qing dynasty and expanding foreign powers. These chapters examine the construction of this network through negotiations between Qing and British officials in the 1860s, the expansion of this network between 1870 and 1895, and the emergence of steam shipping as a field of anti-colonial nationalist activity between 1895 and 1937. The fourth and fifth chapters address the steamship as social space by examining the particular semicolonial organization of work and travel aboard Yangzi steamships, and investigating how that organization came into crisis during the 1920s and 1930s, giving way to a nationalist modernization of steamship space in Chinese companies.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"History, Transportation, China, Imperialism, Nation, Semicolony, Steamship, Yangzi River",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States

Although most of the relevant historiography of modern Korea emphasizes the influence of Japanese colonial rule (1910–1945) on Korea’s modern historical path, I examine the ways that the post-nineteenth-century cultural and intellectual interactions between the literary elites in China and Korea contributed to the rise of modern Korea. In particular, I focus on Korean literary elites in China—envoys, educators, and exiles—to account for the ways that their engagement with Chinese officials and intellectuals stimulated the swift metamorphosis of Korea that began in the 1860s and continued until the end of Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945). The first two chapters of the dissertation investigate early Sino-Korean relations before the arrival of Western influences, examining these relations through exchange envoys and the modern print culture in Shanghai, which strongly influenced Korea in the late nineteenth century. These chapters comprise the first part of the dissertation that focuses on Korea’s encounter with the modern world through China. I show how the perceptions of Korean intellectuals in China contributed directly to the change in Korea’s attitude toward the West, and indeed the world, pushing perspectives far beyond the traditional tributary system toward embracing a broader intellectual curiosity and pursuit. Following this, the next two chapters explore the interactions between Chinese and Korean intellectuals in Shanghai during the Japanese colonial period. Each chapter focuses on influential Korean nationalist thinkers and their activities to legitimize Korea’s anticolonial struggle through a Sino-Korean nationalist dialogue and the political impact of Sino-Korean nationalism in East Asia in the twentieth century. Sino-Korean relations in the early twentieth century illustrate the essential transnational role of intellectual ideas relating to reform, national history, and nationalist thought in shaping cultures and countries. In the conclusion, I suggest how such a historical argument can support the construction of a regional history of East Asia as an approach for examining the political tension in East Asia that has been caused by historical disputes.

2130000017,"Lee, Kwi Jeong","Shaping the Formless: Debates over Buddhist Images in Medieval China, Ca. 300-700",Pre-modern,"This dissertation explores how and why Buddhist cultic images fueled controversy among literati circles from the fourth through seventh centuries in China. This study draws on a wide range of sources in classical Chinese, including essays, letters, memorials, edicts, and court debates, as well as Buddhist texts translated from Indian languages and authored in Chinese, to uncover the points of debate and the debaters’ shifting presuppositions. These sources are used to show that both proponents and critics believed that Buddhist cultic objects were vital, complicated components of what they thought was notable about Buddhism. The dissertation also argues that while the ostensible subject of the debates may have been the role of cultic objects in Buddhist practice, nevertheless the discussion covered other important points of contention, including Buddhahood, the material and institutional foundations of Buddhism, the tenet of emptiness, and the dynamics of Buddhist practice. This dissertation analyzes this multivocality of cultic objects and discusses pre-Buddhist and Buddhist conceptions of images (xiang). Within this framework, the dissertation suggests that proponents of Buddhist positions were keenly aware of the distinction between cultic images and the formless referents of those images. This study notes the historical continuities between indigenous, pre-Buddhist discourses and the later Buddhist conceptualization of images, while also underlining understandings based on the newly imported religion. It argues that interreligious debates over Buddhist images prompted Buddhist apologists to formulate a fuller soteriological account about the meaning and function of cultic images, resulting in a more extensive, sophisticated theory than that supplied by earlier Chinese Buddhist canonical traditions",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,Religion,Religious Studies,"Philosophy, religion and theology, Social sciences, Buddhist cultic objects, Chinese indigenous traditions, impermanence, interreligious debates,",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304506580,"Sun, Anna Xiao Dong","Confusions over Confucianism: Controversies over the religious nature of Confucianism, 1870–2007",Contemporary,"This dissertation addresses three related issues: What were the historical and social processes through which Confucianism became part of the world religion paradigm? How is Confucianism classified in contemporary China and why? How should we understand Confucianism today as social scientists – is it a religion, after all? The search for answers has taken me from the Firestone Library at Princeton to some faraway places, from the Department of Western Manuscripts at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the East India Company Archive in the British Library in London, to various Confucius temples in China, where I conducted interviews and observed ritual practices. In my analysis, I argue for four related theses: First, the legitimation of Confucianism as a world religion was the consequence of how a particular controversy over the religious nature of Confucianism was settled in the late 19 th century, and this settlement was the result of boundary work on the part of the key actors James Legge and Friedrich Max Müller, as well as the result of the interplay of larger social, political and institutional forces. Second, in the ongoing debate over whether Confucianism is a religion in contemporary China, although the settlement has not yet been reached, an analysis of the debate shows that, just like in the late 19 th century controversy, the determining factors are as much social and political as intellectual. Third, despite the fact that scholars have long held conflicting views over the religious status of Confucianism, the classification of Confucianism as one of the major world religions is still an integral part of the world religions paradigm, and the paradigm is still very much in place today. Fourth, based on insights from recent literature on syncretism in the sociology of religion and the notions of “tool kit” and “repertoire” in the sociology of culture, I propose a new way of studying Confucianism by redefining the classification scheme of Chinese religions, and by refocusing on the actual ritual practices of ordinary people.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Religion, History, Sociology, China, Comparative religion, Confucianism, Controversy, Sociology of knowledge, World religion",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304498945,"Yu, Jimmy Yung Fung",Bodies and self -inflicted violence in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century China,Modern,"This dissertation is a cultural history of self-inflicted violent body practices in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century China. It examines how these practices were represented, publicly and privately, within the cultural systems of the time. The range of body practices in this study includes writing letters and copying scriptures with one's blood to perpetuate religious orthodoxy or challenge imperial authority. slicing a piece of flesh from one's body to make medicine for sick parents or parents-in-law. mutilating one's face to resist remarriage or rape. and exposing one's naked body to the sun or setting oneself on fire to produce rain. Those who engaged in these acts include Buddhist clerics, children, chaste women from elite and common backgrounds, officials, and emperors. They sought to graphically demonstrate religious sanctity, filial piety, chastity, loyalty, and the mandate of heaven. Self-inflicted violence was both an inherited construction in late imperial China and a practice remade by historical actors who were themselves shaped by social, political, and religious forces. Performers inflicted violence to their bodies to negotiate new social relations, power structures, and affect meteorological changes. Self-inflicted violence highlights the centrality of the body and the ways in which the body could be used to intervene into the external world in times of personal, social, political, and ideological threat. In this sense, the performers' bodies were sites of contestation and transformation, both for themselves and for others who witnessed or narrated their performance. Numerous accounts of these practices appear in an unusually wide range of genres, including imperial histories, local gazetteers, hagiographies, compendiums of exemplary lives, illustrated books, vernacular literature, poetry, and even medical texts. This range of evidence demonstrates the widespread performance of asceticism and self-mortification, and the preoccupation with the body in Chinese culture during this time. Most discussions of these different practices limit their sources to one genre of evidence, and are also limited to the boundary of one academic discipline, whether in Buddhist studies, Chinese social history, or Chinese literature. Yet the modalities and themes behind these practices are complex and demand an interdisciplinary approach in order to appreciate their cultural significance. This study examines different primary sources in order to portray the pervasiveness of self-mortification in late imperial China. it presents a more nuanced understanding of the social and cultural dynamics involved in specific cases of self-inflicted violence. To date, this approach has never been followed systematically and the broader significance of these practices has remained unexplored.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Religious history, Cultural anthropology, History, Asceticism, Body, Buddhism, China, Chinese religion, Self-inflicted violence, Seventeenth century, Sixteenth century, Violence",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
305262904,"Huang, Xiaojuan","Christian communities and alternative devotions in China, 1780–1860",Contemporary,"This dissertation surveys the history of Christianity in China during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, with particular attention given to Chinese clergy and lay Christians. A variety of issues are discussed: the social organization of Christian communities, the networks among communities in different localities, internal tensions and conflicts, and Christian devotions in relation to the printing and circulation of Chinese Christian texts known as scriptures. By examining a group of unusual sources that have been mostly neglected by past scholars---the correspondence of Chinese Christians with ecclesiastical authorities in Rome, and other more familiar but little studied sources such as memorials and edicts regarding the investigation and interrogation of Chinese Christians and Western missionaries during the period of prohibition (1724-1844)---I intend to show how the imperial ban on Christianity in 1724, especially the expulsion of missionaries and the closing of all churches outside the imperial capital, may have affected Christian beliefs and practices at the local level. The historical survey of the period from 1724 to 1780 and the two case studies in Beijing and Jiangnan from 1780 to 1860 will demonstrate that the repression of Christianity and periodic anti-Christian campaigns did, to some extent, help to shape the Christian community in China, making them into a whole body of people connected by religious identity, as distinguished from non-Christians. Yet this strong sense of community may also have been due to spiritual and social connections with Christian communities beyond China. A second contribution of this dissertation study has to do with its exploring the nuances of Christian and other forms of popular devotions. Recent scholarship that sees Christianity primarily as a Chinese popular religion may have underestimated its distinctive foreignness and in part misunderstood what conversion meant in the context of Chinese religion and society. To some extent, Chinese converts were attracted to Christianity because it provided another choice for them beyond the existing religious traditions. A drastically different calendar characterized by distinctive feast days, fasting and abstinence, veneration of saints, along with other peculiar Christian beliefs and practices, have become what I define as alternative devotions.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Anti-Christian campaigns, Beijing, China, Christian, Jiangnan, Popular religion, Scriptures",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
761634250,"Sloane, Jesse D.","Contending states and religious orders in North China and in East Asian context, 906-1260",Medieval,"In this study I examine the changing role of the state in sponsoring, shaping, and regulating religion in North China from the tenth through thirteenth centuries, focusing on the institution of the monarchy as it differed between contemporaneous states and changed over time. In that period, the geographic area that now constitutes the northeastern quarter of China was a space in which competing states faced off in a rivalry for regional hegemony. The rivalry between the Liao (906–1125) and Northern Song (960–1127) dynasties was succeeded by a confrontation between the Southern Song (1127–1279) and first the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) and then the Mongol state in China (ca. 1214–1368). While “religion” is a modern term, it overlaps with an interrelated complex of concepts in sources from this period, making it a productive analytical category for the investigation of social and political phenomena. These centuries were an era of profound transformations spanning the social, political, cultural, and intellectual spheres. As in other aspects of society, the Liao, Song, Jin, and Mongol bureaucratic states took an active role in the religious life of their polities. The new technology of printing was put to use in the production of scriptural canons compiled by government bureaus. Monasteries, temples, and shrines were founded, rebuilt, and expanded with state oversight and funding, while members of the clergy and even laypersons were selected for government employment on the basis of their command of doctrinal and ritual expertise and their perceived spiritual attainments. An evolving body of statutes determined which religious professionals could enjoy the privileges conferred by government recognition, as well as which monasteries and shrines were protected from closure and other forms of interference by agents of the state. Occupying the top position in the bureaucratic structure, emperors sought to discover or construct for themselves a unique social and even metaphysical status to distinguish them from other elites and potential rivals. Historiography of “Chinese” society in these centuries has created a narrative focused on the richly documented Southeast, leaving developments in North China poorly understood. What studies of the North that do exist commonly seek a misleadingly tidy identification of the Liao, Northern Song, Jin, and early Mongol dynasties with one religion each, typically explained by reference to the ethnic origin of the royal family. My research complicates this picture by considering more closely the processes by which policy was formulated under these states and their impact on the population as a whole. For all dynasties in this period I find that frequent international religious exchanges, both between states in “China” and with Japan and Korea, generally did not advance either commercial or strategic interests despite common assumptions to the contrary. I demonstrate how domestic concerns drove individual Northern Song emperors to experiment with a series of widely varying religious roles and institutional innovations. These decisions at the highest level of power ultimately proved less influential and durable domestically than other trends in social practice and political culture. I show further that the Liao and Jin emperors adopted religious roles owing less to their nomadic ethnic origins than to the norms held by elite groups among their subjects, and to disparate models of Buddhist patronage borrowed from the Song monarchy at different stages of its ongoing metamorphosis.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Asian Studies, Political science, China, Hegemony, Jin Dynasty, Liao Dynasty, Monarchy, Northeast Asia, Religion, Religious orders, Song Dynasty",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304827031,"Chapman, Ian D.","Carnival canons: Calendars, genealogy, and the search for ritual cohesion in medieval China",Medieval,"This dissertation examines attempts in medieval China (c. 190–960) to situate popular festival customs in history. I argue that writers in this period combined competing models of cultural change to emphasize the creation of cultural cohesion, claiming that shared ritual origins had produced common ritual practice. I explore these issues from two perspectives, textual and thematic. The first is festival calendars. Conquest, capture, and family connections perpetuated a closed transmission of calendar composition from the third to the early seventh centuries, wherein unfolded a conversation on the role of customs in forging both local identity and imperial cohesion. Drawing on the classical template of the “Yueling” chapter of Li ji, Zhou Chu’s Fengtu ji, Zong Lin and Du Gongzhan’s Jing-Chu suishiji, and Du Taiqing’s Yuzhu baodian frame relationships between local and imperial contexts reflective of concurrent moves towards political reunification. Central to their visions of cultural community were theories of ritual genealogy. One model posited unified classical origins, reserving for sages of antiquity the agency to generate or codify ritual. Another proposed the homogeneous diffusion of recent innovations, crediting far humbler actors with the capacity to create new cultural forms. A historicizing paradigm new to this period was that of festivals of biographic commemoration. There were two distinct species of this. Death commemoration appeared in the second century and quickly generated etiologic tales for a great many festival customs. Many were related to the need to placate and harness restless ghosts produced by unnatural deaths. It assigned generative agency to a diverse cast of the dangerous and downtrodden, from ancient demi-gods to luckless women, children, and officials. The second category was a range of commemorations of critical events in the life of the Buddha. In medieval sectarian Buddhist writings, these were multivalent and polysemous. But in other circles, the single image of birth commemoration captured the imagination. The Tang dynasty imperial state responded with the institution of the Emperor’s birthday festival. This reinvented historical commemoration as veneration for the living. but similarly served to create a ritual community around a cult of personal biography.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Buddhism, Calendars, China, Commemoration, Festivals, Genealogy, Medieval, Popular religion, Ritual",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
250832722,"Kim, Sangkeun","Strange names of God: The missionary translation of the divine name and the Chinese responses to Matteo Ricci's Shangti in late Ming China, 1583–1644",Modern,"The present dissertation provides a historical survey of “the transformation of Christian faith” through cross-cultural missionary translation of the divine name of the Christian God with the specific case of Matteo Ricci's translation, Shangti , and the Chinese intellectuals' responses to the strange name of God in late Ming China (1583–1644). Andrew Walls' emphasis on the transformation of Christian faith through cross-cultural missionary translation is examined with a non-primal Chinese case for the first time. The author argues that the agents of the transformation of Christian faith in the Christian history of China are not only the Jesuit missionaries and first Chinese Christians but also the anti-Christian Chinese intellectuals, who owned a far more accurate understanding of the Christian God, Shangti , than the first Chinese converts. Chapter one examines the late sixteenth-century Thomistic orientation in the early Jesuit curricula and educational directives. Chapter two presents the early Jesuit missionaries' translation of the divine name in Japan (Francis Xavier), Peru (José de Acosta) and South India (Roberto de Nobili) in a case study format. Chapter three discusses the translation of the divine name before Ricci's Shangti , which includes the translation of the Nestorians, the Keifeng Jews, the Franciscans, the Dominican Juan Cobo, and the Jesuit Michele Ruggieri. Western missionaries' divided responses to Ricci's translation and a brief historical survey of the Chinese term controversy issues after 1644 are then presented. Chapter Four provides the examination of the pre-existing semantic distribution of Shangti in China. It is followed by the examination of Chinese intellectuals' varied responses to Ricci's Shangti , with the intellectuals divided into three groups, viz. the Christian converts (Hsü Kuang-ch'i, Li Chih-tsao, and Yang Ting-yün), the “Permitting” Confucian scholars, and the “Opposing” anti-Christian intellectuals. The study wraps up with an argument that through the anti-Christian intellectuals' ideological rejection of what they considered to be the barbarous mistranslation of Shangti , which was presented in the Sheng-ch'ao P'o-hsieh-chi , for example, Shangti ironically underwent a semantic transformation as the Christian “God” in the Chinese semantic domains.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, China, Divine name, God, Ming, Missionary, Ricci, Matteo, Shangti, Translation",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304837926,"Wooldridge, William Charles, Jr.",Transformations of ritual and state in nineteenth-century Nanjing,Contemporary,"The nineteenth century was an age of utopian visions in China. As population growth, economic dislocation, and foreign encroachment weakened the ruling Qing dynasty (1644-1911), new political movements arose offering alternate sources of authority. This dissertation examines the devastating clash between two of these visions: that of the iconoclastic, Christianity-inspired Taiping rebellion (1850-1864) and that of the leadership of regional militias the Qing employed to crush the rebellion after regular government troops proved ineffective. Because the Taiping made Nanjing their capital, the city became the focus of this conflict. At war's end more than twenty million people had perished, and Nanjing was a ruin. To rebuild Nanjing during the so-called Tongzhi Restoration, the dynasty relied on the same people who had defeated the Taiping. These men were inspired by their own utopia, one in which the actions of local elites rather than the virtue of the emperor formed the basis for solving social problems. A primary means for articulating and enacting this vision was offerings to a pantheon of gods, heroes, and martyrs. Although government officials normally performed these offerings, Nanjing elites found ways to change the system so that rituals honoring Confucius, virtuous women, and the war dead all celebrated local activism as a central feature of the polity. Nanjing residents thus shored up the Qing state at the expense of Qing emperors. Previous scholarship on nineteenth-century China has been teleological, focusing on the rise of the nation state and the fall of the Qing. The concept of utopian visions addresses this issue by emphasizing the array of contemporary political alternatives while still offering a fresh context for later developments. One element of the power of the twentieth-century Chinese state was the claim that it derived its authority from the collective activity of its citizens. Such a vision had emerged in the wake of the violence of the mid-nineteenth century---with the difference that in the nineteenth century the central idiom for expressing a person's relationship to the state was not citizenship but ritual.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, China, Nanjing, Nineteenth century, Qing dynasty, Ritual, Taiping rebellion",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
305418683,"Chen, Huaiyu",The revival of Buddhist monasticism in medieval China,Medieval,"Having recovered from political persecution and resolved problems within the sangha, Buddhism reached a summit in its development during Sui and Early Tang China (581–755). Daoxuan (596–667) played an unparalleled role in shaping the direction of Buddhist history during the medieval period through both his rich writings and his innovations of monastic rituals and regulations. This dissertation focuses on several key issues in his work, including the veneration of Buddha-relics and its relationship to the reconstruction and renovation of Buddhist monasteries as authoritative structures and as ground for the monastic community, the recreation of the ordination platform and ordination ritual, and the way in which the Buddhist community reclassified and dealt with monastic property. First, it discusses the historical background of Chinese Buddhism from the fifth to the seventh centuries. This study then argues that, in reinterpreting the image of southern Buddhism as a cultural tradition, Daoxuan sought a new model for the Chinese Buddhist tradition as a whole. More specifically, this study argues that the ritual of venerating relics as a commemorative ceremony functioned to expand the religious power of Buddhism in Chinese society and enhance the bonds within the monastic community. This study also interprets the creation of the ordination platform as a crucial element in the restoration of the Chinese monastic order. In addition, this study suggests that Daoxuan developed his new rules to create an innovative model for the Buddhist community as a ground for individual monks' spiritual progress. He did this in part by reclassifying monastic property as communal and individual property. In sum, Daoxuan created a new tradition of Chinese Buddhist monasticism.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Cultural anthropology, Buddhist, China, Medieval, Monasticism",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304984290,"Choo, Jessey Jiun-Chyi",Historicized ritual and ritualized history—women's lifecycle in late Medieval China (600–1000 AD),Medieval,"The dissertation, titled “Historicized Ritual and Ritualized History—Women’s Life-Cycle Rituals in Medieval China, 600-1000 AD,” focuses on rituals that women performed to prevent or resolve personal crises as they entered critical junctures of their life, such as childbirth, marriage, illness and death. Medieval China was a highly ritualized society. Confucian rituals, in particular, served as the basis of legal codes pertaining to social interactions of all kinds. Mourning as well as adjudication was conducted according to the relationship between the mourner and the mourned and between the parties involved in any legal proceeding. The dissertation examines the competing ritual programs drawn from Buddhist, Daoist, and folk traditions to which women resorted in order to secure safe passage through liminal phases. Underpinning such behavior was the common belief that supernatural forces could be manipulated to affect the outcome of human affairs. The dissertation clarifies the process through which these ritual programs were understood by supplicants to have power in transforming their lives and afterlives. At a time when the netherworld was constantly being re-imagined and its relationship to this-world re-defined with the advent of Buddhist and Daoist theologies, Confucianism did not have ready a soteriology that provides comparable care for the dead or lends equally persuasive explanation to predicaments that women had to face day in and day out. Women’s demand for a more gender-specific soteriology that explains their allotted positions in the society and the accompanying sufferings fueled a competition among major religious traditions. in which Buddhism topped all its competitors by presenting a women-only hell with Daoism in tow. Women fell into this hell as their menstruation blood and childbirth fluid pollute the heaven and earth. This Buddho-Daoist explanation and the accompanying ritual solutions became immensely popular not only in medieval China but also in Japan in the subsequent age. The dissertation thus argues that the better a soteriology came to explain the roots of women’s lots and sufferings, the lesser the value women came to attach to the bodily contributions they made to their family and society. The dissertation also analyzes the cultural milieu that shaped and was reshaped by women’s manipulation of ritual programs and of public discourses with regard to lifecycle rituals. It systematically examines many medieval documents, either transmitted or recently excavated, that have not been utilized previously in the study of Chinese women’s history and religion. Such documents include epitaphs, ritual and etiquette manuals, prayer texts, dedication colophons, and medical and divination treatises. It also addresses historiographical issues regarding the use of these written records to capture daily life. Therefore, its research broadens our approaches to family and social history, and challenges commonly held notions about medieval Chinese family structures and mother-child relationships.

305261111,"Nappi, Carla Suzan",The monkey of the inkpot: Natural history and its transformations in early modern China,Ancient,"This dissertation investigates natural history in early modern China, seen primarily through the lens of the Bencao gangmu (1596), a massive work of materia medica and natural history written by Ming scholar Li Shizhen (1518-1593) in the last decades of the sixteenth century. The Bencao functioned as a stage on which many great debates over the natural world in China were enacted, and this thesis is devoted primarily to exploring and understanding the epistemological mechanics of those arguments. Fact-making in the Bencao and other natural history texts relied on a combination of innovative citation practices, example-making, and negotiation between sensory and textual evidence that together created an epistemological environment wherein scholars created notions of reasonableness and of absurdity. I argue that a deep commitment to the centrality of transformation and change in the universe shaped Li Shizhen's epistemology and informed all aspects of the Bencao gangmu . Li invoked varied sets of authoritative sources and focused his comments on different themes when treating different categories of natural objects, from the primacy of foundational notions of change in discussing members of the Five Phases, to the importance of poetry as a source of authority when discussing plants, to the role of analogy in debating the morality of using human body parts in food and medicine. This dissertation explores the thematic and epistemic nuances of each major category treated in the Bencao gangmu in turn, situating the debates therein within a broader context of late Ming texts on plants, animals, and stones. The discussions within the Bencao gangmu resonated through a history of reinterpretations of the work, from appendation to the text using local gazetteers as a result of Qing expansion of imperial territory, to a twentieth century refashioning of Li Shizhen as scientist, comic-book figure, artistic muse, and medical icon.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,NA,NA,"Science history, History, Bencao gangmu, China, Li, Shizhen, Natural history",73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
2210000021,"Guo, Jinsong","Knowing Number: Mathematics, Astronomy, and the Changing Culture of Learning in Middle-Period China, 1100–1300",Medieval,"This dissertation seeks to integrate the history of mathematical knowledge in middle-period China with the history of its learned culture. It challenges the traditional historiographic image of Chinese mathematics and astronomy as socially and epistemically isolated enterprises, and argues that their significant development in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was in deep connection with the primary programs of learning for the literati and for those who aspired to become one of them—reading texts and comprehending tradition. In so doing, the study stresses the overlapping ventures of knowledge making under the broad rubric of “number” (shu 數) and the communication between divergent intellectual groups in a time when the hierarchy of “learning” (xue 學) was flexible and contestable. This dissertation is divided into two parts, each in turn consisting of two chapters in the form of case studies. Part I mainly focuses on mathematics in the Southern Song (1127–1279), highlighting the connected endeavors of mathematicians and literati in the making and application of numerical knowledge largely outside of state sponsorship or control. Part II turns to Chinese mathematical astronomy under the Mongol Empire (1206–1259) and the early Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), featuring a stronger presence of political power as well as cross-cultural elements. In the first part, chapter 1 analyzes and compares three Southern Song publishers of mathematical books, who belonged to divergent social groups of literati and practitioners but displayed parallel efforts to make mathematical knowledge more accessible through printed texts. Chapter 2 discusses literati scholars' and mathematicians' shared engagement with numerical problems related to milfoil divination and the Classic of Changes (Yijing 易經). In the second part, chapter 3 looks into the uses of textual investigations in the calendar reform of the Yuan around 1280, highlighting the astronomers' precise choice of hermeneutical stance and its relation with contemporary classical scholarship.

2724219429,"Zhai, Minhao","Buddhist Talismans and Manuscript Culture in Medieval China, Ca. 500–1000",Medieval,"The dissertation discusses how Buddhist talismans were made, used, and understood in medieval China from the fifth through the tenth centuries. The study is based on a wide range of medieval sources, including transmitted canonical scriptures, apocryphal texts (yiwei jing 疑偽經), catalogues, hagiographies, standard histories, anecdotes, and unearthed ritual manuals from Dunhuang. The dissertation proposes that the current category of talismans in medieval China should be expanded. Instead of considering those labelled fu 符 as the only samples of talisman, the study provides a much broader conceptual framework that includes all consecrated man-made objects that release their efficacy through their contact with the human body. The new framework enables us to see the multivalent positions towards talismanic practices in medieval Buddhist communities. It also allows the dissertation to explore the commonalities in the making process between different religious traditions in medieval China. The research analyzes the major paradigms of utilizing talismans. It argues that the different patterns of logic behind these paradigms contribute to the construction of efficacy in talismans. This study also questions the bias that believes talismanic benefits are limited to the this-worldly realm. It shows that talismans were also tools concerning soteriological goals. Meanwhile, medieval people, no matter religious masters or lay practitioners, did not berate the mundane and materialistic benefits bestowed by talismans. Finally, the study reveals that talismanic practices were closely related to other ritual techniques and belonged to a larger ritual milieu. These techniques often inspired each other and were used together to address the difficulties and anxieties facing medieval minds. In sum, the dissertation proves that Buddhism, as an imported religion, both significantly benefited from and contributed to the talismanic tradition in medieval China.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,Princeton University,Religion,Religious Studies,NA,73,Princeton,New Jersey,40.3562,-74.6693,United States
304544304,"Wang, Cheng-chih",Words kill: Calling for the destruction of class enemies in China (1949--1953),Contemporary,"When Communist revolutionaries seized control of Mainland China in 1949, they faced enormous challenges of state and nation building. China occupied a vast territory, had a huge and poorly integrated population and suffered from a woefully backward economy. Building a Socialist Chinese state required, among other things, effectively managing significant opposition to the imposition of the Communist regime. Building the Chinese Communist nation required, among other things, developing some shared sense of collective political identity among members of the highly diverge population. This study examines the way the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) employed language as an essential part of its strategy to achieve these goals. In particular, it focuses on the Party's attempt to legitimize the extreme path it took for dealing with its opposition: the elimination of 80,000–3,000,000 “class enemies” between 1949 and 1953. A regime can advance both its opposition management and national identification building objectives by socially constructing “friends” and “foes,” and by developing a discourse for taking about such symbolic categories that the mass population can use routinely to make sense of their world, past and present. Content analysis of the Party's official medium of mass communication, the People's Daily (Ren Min Rih Bao, RMRB), published during the 1949–1953 period, reveals that CCP discourse offered the unifying vision of “People's Democracy.” The Party also constructed enemies of this “utopia” such as “imperialism and its accomplices,” “the bandit gentry,” the “bureaucrat bourgeoisie,” “counter-revolutionaries” and others, in such a way as to legitimate their destruction. As the Party urged action toward eliminating its opposition, the constructed enemies were treated as real, with real effects. Indeed, words kill, and do so by the millions. The research findings lend support to the argument that language can be an important tool for a regime to legitimate its actions, even including genocidal practices.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Purdue University,NA,NA,"Social structure, History, Political science, China, Class enemies, Communist Party, Genocide",1,West Lafayette,Indiana,40.4432,-86.9238,United States

751582014,"Rawley, Sarah Spencer",He Luting: Musical defiance in Maoist China,Contemporary,"Composer and educator He Luting (1903-1999) became one of the most influential musical figures in China's history. Trained in the Western classical tradition, He Luting promulgated the musical techniques of the West while dedicating himself to raising the standards of music in modern China. His outspoken advocacy of Western classical music rendered him a target during the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), causing him to become a victim of one of the earliest and most vicious attacks of that campaign. His bravery and defiance garnered him national attention, and he achieved legendary status for thousands of Chinese intellectuals terrorized by that regime. This document will show the effects of the ever-changing political climate of Maoist China on Chinese musicians, as reflected in the life and career of He Luting. A thorough examination of the humble beginnings and life experiences of He Luting will clearly portray the ways in which the changing polemics of the Communist Party influenced the musical education and compositional style of prominent Chinese musicians. This document also depicts how the writings of Claude Debussy attracted the notice of those in the highest levels of government, and how He Luting's subsequent defense of Debussy's writings resulted in what they deemed the most serious counterrevolutionary incident prior to the Cultural Revolution. He Luting's subsequent interrogation and violent abuse (which had the distinction of being the only live, televised struggle session during this regime) is portrayed, as well as its effects on intellectuals throughout China. A detailed account of the sufferings of prominent musicians in Shanghai and their persecution by the government is also given in comparison with the case of He Luting. Other issues explored will include the importance of music in Maoist China, and why many musicians were persecuted for defending a musical culture that was not their own.",2010,2010,D.M.A.,United States,Rice University,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, Music, Political science, China, Debussy, Claude, He, Luting, Maoist China, Music, Shanghai Conservatory, Struggle session",2,Houston,Texas,29.786,-95.3885,United States
1749001630,"Giblin, Molly J.",Entangled empires: The French in China,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines attempts French to renew national prestige by establishing a lasting presence in the Pacific, with China at its fulcrum. Culturally informed readings of diplomatic, legal, religious and military archival materials, fiction, and published memoirs locate the foundations of the French presence in Asia within affect-driven encounters among the French and Chinese. Working at the interstices of cultural, social, gender and diplomatic history reveals how both French and Chinese subjects first embraced a partnership based on culture and sentiment to foster material, social, and diplomatic ties between their nations. However, the nascent French quest for global expansion quickly evolved into a drive for conquest. This study begins by identifying the ideological catalysts behind imperial revitalization in the post-Napoleonic era, as French agents sought to unite the pieces of their empire through connections to global networks of trade, diplomacy, and exploration. In the 1840s, members of the French commercial mission cemented new and existing trade connections by fashioning personal relationships with their Chinese counterparts. French missionaries and diplomats alike cultivated an image of benevolent compassion to counter what they believed was an aggressive British imperial manhood. Meanwhile, dueling stereotypes of Chinese nobility and decay mirrored French anxieties over their national future, and served as poles between which French individuals could attempt to articulate the revival of their national body by guiding, but not dominating, their Asian partner. However, intimate bonds could be profoundly unsettling. At the height of various Chinese rebellions in the 1850s, visions of a perilous zone of contact led to profound transformations in Franco-Chinese relations. The cultural weight of this shift appears most markedly in the Anglo-French Expedition of 1860, when the symbolic conquest and subsequent triumphal display of looted Chinese objects in Paris set the tone for an aggressive French occupation of other Asian territories, which continues to weigh on French national identity and foreign policy. As sacred Chinese space was penetrated and pillaged, the shared history of France and China was further entangled when objects conveying the authority of the Emperor were re-incorporated into French and British apparatuses of power through public display.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Rutgers University,Graduate School - New Brunswick,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, European history, World History, Affect, China, Cultural history, Diplomacy, Emotion, Empire, France, Gender, Material culture, Trade",3,New Brunswick,New Jersey,40.8158536588864,-74.4611610076916,United States
304818094,"Yeung, King-To","Suppressing rebels, managing bureaucrats: State -building during the Taiping Rebellion, 1850–1864",Contemporary,"This study uses the historical case of the Taiping Rebellion (1850-64) to examine the process of state-building in an early modern empire. I focus on the interactions between volatile battles the Qing state launched against the Taipings and the changing social relationships among state actors embedded in preexisting rules and established organizational norms. In the early phase of the rebellion, 1851-1856, Peking tended to address the problem of controlling rebellion-ridden provinces by deploying state agents closely linked to the Manchu center. At the same time, negative sanctions, jurisdictional indifference, and interpersonal conflicts all surged among state agents. The rebels’ unpredictable actions, the sporadic sequencing of their battles, and their cross-jurisdictional mobility gave state actors numerous opportunities to act in ways that deviated from state interests. By the late 1850s, a new set of bureaucratic deployments emerged to address these problems. Colleague-officials had become more alike by dint of their ethnicities, provincial origins, and educational backgrounds. These changes in social ties and bureaucratic networks might have redrawn the parameters of the bureaucratic organization, creating a potential danger for central control. Applying the idea of “vacancy chains,” I demonstrate that vacancies initiated in response to exigent demands in the battlefield could extensively impact the rest of the bureaucratic structure. The dynamics of vacancy chains brought together two distinct fields of social actions, linking rebellion suppression to the formation of the Qing bureaucratic field. By the 1870s, official careers appeared to be more stable than in the tumultuous 1850s, but the state bureaucracy as a whole had undergone—since the second half of the 1850s—a process of detachment. In the wake of the rebellion, provincial officials were more integrated into a provincial bureaucratic system that had been gradually made separate from the metropolitan bureaucracy. I ultimately provide a view of state-building as a continuous process whereby crisis and routine are intertwined, in which state rulers and their agents can at once build a “state” together and take it apart.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Rutgers University,NA,NA,"History, Social structure, China, Historical sociology, Social networks, State formation, State-building, Taiping Rebellion, Vacancy chains",3,New Brunswick,New Jersey,40.8158536588864,-74.4611610076916,United States
4580000077,"Nie, Qingfeng","Ordering the Urban Space in Luoyang, 600–1000 CE",Pre-modern,"This dissertation explores the construction and evolution of the urban order in Luoyang, a metropolis in medieval China, functioning as the secondary capital during the major part of the historical period between the seventh and the tenth centuries. Examining various extant historical evidence such as traditional historical and geographical records, archaeological excavations, literary works, contemporary anecdotes, and entombed epigraphy, I analyze the stability of this urban order embedded in Luoyang’s steady infrastructure and its constant fluidity of people, goods, wealth, and information. I argue that the constant interaction between the urbanites in Luoyang and its changing landscape determined the characteristics, functions, and destiny of this secondary capital, and that its relative stability, maintained in a seemingly oxymoronic fluidity, effectively sustained the city’s incessant prosperity both in and beyond these four centuries. Mapping out the historical process of negotiation between the cityscape and its inhabitants, my dissertation reapproaches the space of a medieval Chinese city by looking beyond archaeological evidence to introduce Luoyang’s urbanites and their lived experiences back into their urban environment. This study thus contributes to a more critical understanding of a prominent city. First, a city of its own kind, Luoyang in these four centuries persistently rejected isolation while upholding a metropolitan spirit of opening up to the world, thus matching the historical attitude adopted by the Tang dynasty (618–907), a genuine world empire. Second, the city also experienced a significant shift in its urban management during the tenth century, which betokened the imminent arrival of the early modern era in China’s history. Finally, the city continued to prosper despite the historical turbulence, which exemplified the unique continuity of Chinese civilization. Judging from these three aspects, we can see that this project will profoundly enhance our understanding of the general society of premodern China, a mammoth empire that calls for regional studies.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,Rutgers University,Comparative Literature,Comparative Literature,"Order, Urban environments, 600-1000 CE, Infrastructure, Social fluidity, China,",3,New Brunswick,New Jersey,40.8158536588864,-74.4611610076916,United States

Although men dominated medicine, female doctors and nurses played an important role serving the poor and reaching women in China and Japan, where social norms restricted contact between the sexes. Thus, female medical professionals, represented by Yamei Kin, promoted the general welfare of the people, spread medical knowledge, and inspired more women to independence and excellence by their medical work. Yamei Kin is the first Chinese woman who obtained a medical degree in the United States (1885). A trailblazing physician, Kin broke the Chinese and Japanese prejudice against Western medicine and opened the medical profession to women in these two countries. She gave public lectures around America and England on women’s issues such as suffrage and prison reforms. She served as China correspondent of international women’s congress and shuttled among China, U.S. and Europe to improve women’s social status and promote the importance of women’s education.

China in particular has been advancing to modernity for the better part of a century. In addition, there exists no one particular catalyst for the process of the modernization of a nation. Many actors and many actions helped to shape modern states into their present forms. This researcher seeks to add to this body of literature by examining the role of the Reagan administration in the modernization of China. The researcher analyzes Sino-American relations under Pres. Reagan in the light of the role his policies and his various appointments played in encouraging China to move forward toward the prominent position in world economic and political affairs that it enjoys today. This researcher also focuses on why the Reagan administration's attempts produced such successful results for China whereas those before it did not. While China was in the end ultimately responsible for its own modernization, this investigator posits that any effort by Beijing would not have been as expedient or successful without the policies implemented by Pres. Reagan. A certain paradox exists in the president's treatment of China in a lesser light than had Nixon or Carter, in that China developed faster in spite of this apparent lessening in encouraged modernization. Reagan did not aim at ultimately modernizing China, yet his non-theoretical, free market based economic and political approach may have been the very catalyst needed to finally fully awaken the sleeping giant.",2010,2010,D.A.,United States,St. John's University,NA,NA,"History, American history, China, Modernization, Ronald Reagan",7,Queens,New York,40.7498,-73.7976,United States

Newsmagazines had a special place in American culture during this time. Time and Life, through their distinct styles, grabbed the public's attention. The son of a missionary reared in China, Henry Luce, had a personal vision of what direction China should take in its development. Through his publications, Time and Life, Luce covered the major events of China from the Henan famine to the Communist take-over of the mainland. Luce's Life magazine became well known by using big pictures and color photographs to report the news. Life presents a visual chronicle of contemporary America and current events in popular culture. Readers find powerful images of Chiang Kai-shek throughout the late 1930's and 1940's. By the 1950's, the viewpoint has shifted to present less positive images.

304524469,"Veteri, Frank James",A comparative study of the modernized economies of Taiwan and South Korea,Contemporary,"This research essay will focus on the factors that were responsible for the economic modernization of Taiwan and South Korea in the twentieth century and how the economies of Taiwan and South Korea have been implemented into the New York State Global Studies Curriculum. In Taiwan and South Korea, the state was so deeply involved in every aspect of development and gave priority to domestic demand. They employed almost two decades of import substitution In order to build up their own businesses. The government in both countries enacted extensive land reforms. Rapid industrialization in Taiwan and South Korea can be explained by their rapid accumulation of productive factors such as physical capital, human capital and technology. Both governments made an effort to build up heavy industry. Taiwan's economy right from the start of industrialization was composed of many small firms and tended to remain that way. in South Korea, a handful of large conglomerates (chaebol) began to dominate the economy in the 1960s. In the early 1970s, Taiwan began to shift from peripheral to semiperipheral status in the world economy. By 1970 South Korea had achieved NIC (newly-industrializing country) status. South Korea continued Its rapid growth throughout the 1980s. However, in late 1997, a serious economic crisis occurred in South Korea. The economic crisis that began in Japan and South Korea in 1997 was primarily caused by high debt levels and poor economic decisions made by the leaders in both countries. South Korea has lagged behind Taiwan in the 1990s because the chaebuls had too much control over the economy and the Koreans lacked the entrepreneurship and risk capital of Taiwan. As of now, the economy of Taiwan is relatively strong and the economy of South Korea is showing some signs of recovery.

The author focuses on the investigation of the forces that drove CCK to embark on political reform and that led Taiwan onto a trajectory of democracy. This researcher has come up with several findings. CCK's launching of democratic reforms was driven by internal and external forces. About internal factors, the opposition gathered its power together to challenge the KMT's authoritarian rule. They demand democratic reform by ways of publishing dangwai periodicals, organizing opposition parties, and mobilizing mass movements. The KMT liberals endeavored to improve human rights, freedom, and democracy in Taiwan in various ways. Problems within the KMT that accelerated the decline of the KMT's prestige and cut short public trust in his rule and that might cause its internal factions motivated CCK to reform the KMT. Strong voices advocating visits to the mainland and legalization of indirect trade between Taiwan and China showed that martial law did not fit for the changing society of Taiwan. On external factors, the international community influenced Taiwan's democratic development by promoting human rights in Taiwan and supporting political competition between the KMT and its opponents. The intervention of the United States was a major contribution to Taiwan's transition to democracy. The Taiwanese democratic movements in Japan and the United States attracted the attention of the U.S. State Department and Congress, as well as international societies and human rights organizations, and then obtained their support. The democratization in the Philippines and South Korea encouraged the opposition, and it made CCK realize that the trend toward democracy in the world could not be stopped. In terms of antagonistic relationships between Taiwan and the PRC, CCK thought that building Taiwan as a democratic country was a peaceful way and the only way to reunite China. Finally, CCK's insight and wisdom to adjust himself to the changes of internal and external situations were also important factors that made the peaceful transition possible.",2006,2006,D.A.,United States,St. John's University,NA,NA,"History, History, Chiang Ching-kuo, China, Democratic transition, Taiwan",7,Queens,New York,40.7498,-73.7976,United States

304807157,"Ramlal, Derek",Qigong and the modernization of China,Contemporary,"This researcher examines an ancient tradition from China known as qigong, and the intermixing of this tradition with contemporary modernizing forces. The principal period is from the early 1980s to the present. During the 1980s, China saw an explosion of popular interest in qigong. Also, it was in the 1980s that qigong made its fullest global disclosure by way of international conferences held in China, Japan, Canada, and the United States. The purpose of this investigator is to explore what qigong is and its interrelationship with aspects of modernization. This essay is divided into three parts. The first part consists of three chapters. Chapter one addresses the question, what are qi and qigong? Chapter two explores the beliefs of modern practitioners regarding the development of qigong in China. In addition to beliefs, qigong also includes various practices that are linked to phenomenal claims. therefore chapter three will explore how qigong is supposed to work. The second part of this investigation is also comprised of three chapters (chapters four, five, and six). Chapter four takes account of qigong's early interactions with modernizing forces by examining the Boxer Uprising (1898-1900), which was an organized opposition against foreigners and Christians in China. The Boxer Uprising is significant because not only was qigong the primary practice of the Boxers, but also because the claims of qigong's abilities were used as a means of recruiting new Boxers. This shows how qigong movements have historically been powerful and threatening to the status quo. Chapters five and six explore the process of modernization in China, prefatory to analysis of qigong's interaction with modern politics (chapter five) and modern science (chapter six).

This study is grounded in sixth- to eleventh-century Chinese manuscripts and murals preserved at the Mogao Grottoes, a bustling Buddhist cave complex in the Dunhuang region. I expand this localized focus with analysis of texts, images, and maps whose productions range from the Six Dynasties (220--589) to the Song Dynasty (960--1279), from sand-swept caves of Dunhuang to elite temples of central China, and from the hands of anonymous local scribes to imperially sponsored scholar-monks. Each chapter examines a unique method of crafting cosmologies in medieval China. These methods are demonstrated inductively, grounded in three distinct bodies of materials, each evincing a particular pursuit in the production. Chapter One highlights the method of crafting cosmologies through visual transformation, examining wall murals at Mogao that engage in the artistic pursuit of turning a Mainstream text into a collection of graphic narrative maps of two distinct universes and one micro-cosmos. Chapter Two uncovers the creative method of textual appropriation, examining two new texts added to the Lotus Sūtra which I identify as having been made from at least one pre-existing cosmology. Chapter Three explores an element of material culture, examining one cohesive manuscript in order to illuminate possible practical pursuits involved in the creation of a meta-cosmology through the practice of textual compilation.

885875351,"Reinhart, Katrinka","Politics of food, feasting, and sacrifice in the Chinese Bronze Age: Quantitative analysis of pottery at Yanshi Shangcheng",Ancient,"This dissertation examines the role of food, feasting, and sacrifice in the generation of social inequality at the early Shang dynasty site of Yanshi Shangcheng by examining the remains of food practices, including the organic residues in pottery and the pottery deposited in ritual and domestic contexts. The Chinese Bronze Age was a period of early state formation, a time of factional competition among polities and burgeoning of material culture revolving around elite ritual practice. Social inequality, which was rooted in earlier Neolithic times, increased over the course of the Shang dynasty culminating around at the Late Shang capital site of Yinxu as evidenced by the mortuary remains displaying extensive human sacrifice and massive elite tombs with lavish furnishings. Four hundred years earlier at the beginning of the dynasty, Shang social stratification was at an earlier stage of development. The inscriptional record and texts from the early historic period indicate that one of the priorities of the Shang elite was to perform sacrificial offerings to their ancestors, hosting them in ritual feasts that involved the sacrifice of animals, the consumption of sacrificial food, and the use of elaborate bronze food vessels. A large ritual deposit at the Early Shang site of Yanshi Shangcheng, occupied from ca. 1600–1365 BC, appears to be the remains of a temple site where such rituals would have taken place. This deposit, located inside the Yanshi Palace displays the remains of intensive and continuous sacrificial activity. Pottery from this deposit was compared with pottery deposited in pits in a lower status residential area in the northeast sector of the site known as Area IV. Both pottery assemblages date to the second phase of occupation (Yanshi Phase II), which was a period of flourishing of the settlement. Quantitative analysis of pottery included both typological and fabric analysis involving various numerical and statistical techniques. Results indicated that the types of pots deposited in the temple site were larger and more diverse that those found in Area IV. There were also types appropriate for serving, transport, and storage rather than cooking and a number of unique types pointing to a more elaborate cuisine. Pots deposited in Area IV pits, by contrast, were more suitable for cooking, especially steaming, and the service of smaller groups of people. Through contextual analysis, these results were interpreted as representing feasting in the temple site and more modest cooking in Area IV. The Area IV assemblage also included pottery jue vessels, which were absent in the Palace. This was interpreted as evidence of emulation or minoring of the elite practice of using jue in rituals for drinking or libation. Thus although historical and archaeological narratives tend to portray the elite as stewards of ancestor ritual, it is quite possible that people from Area IV were practicing ritual offerings in their domestic setting. With regard to quality and aesthetics, pottery from the Palace was harder and lighter in color, indicating developments in firing technology in this domain. These developments appear related to further developments of firing temperature throughout the Shang indicating a bifurcation of knowledge and technology into an elite domain and a more common domain tied to earlier tradition. The more subtle changes in outward appearance of pottery used in the Palace did not detract from the general appearance, which was still similar enough to that of Area IV (gray and much of it cord-marked) to indicate a common Shang identity between both domains. This appeal to tradition may have been useful at stabilizing the state during a time of increasing political instability. A shift in sacrificial activities occurred in the final stage of occupation at Yanshi involving a diversification of the types of animals sacrificed, the introduction or intensification of human sacrifice, and a shift in location to a more open setting. This change paralleled or heralded the abandonment of the site suggesting a close relationship between ritual and power. The introduction of sacrifice of a greater variety of animals would need to be analyzed carefully in context but it is clear that there was a greater display of power, perhaps in the face of political instability that ultimately led to abandonment of the settlement. Careful further contextual analysis of ritual and domestic deposits at Yanshi will be necessary to clarify questions surrounding pottery deposition, such as whether the elite were consuming the sacrificial foods inside the temple (or whether offerings were made only ancestor consumption) and whether people of lower status may have been practicing ritual offering in domestic settings.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Archaeology of food, China, Feasting, Ritual, Sacrifice, Shang dynasty, State formation",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
305438926,"Lee, Marion Sung-Hua","Women, men and morality: Paintings and prints by Fei Xiaolou (1801/2–1850)",Contemporary,"Focusing on pictorial art including prints, which were done by Fei Xiaolou (1801/2–50) in Hangzhou, this dissertation provides a broad horizon for interdisciplinary study in early nineteenth-century China. The governing assumption is that the tumultuous period, associated through historiographical convention with the beginnings of modern China, was characterized by multifaceted changes. They included the accelerated blurring of social distinctions among populations in urban centers, heightened commercial activities in a market economy, as well as the increasing visibility of women in the literary and artistic arenas. These changes, which took place amidst established traditional values and practices, led to conflicts, contradictions, and collective anxiety. Three main integrating themes have structured my dissertation. The first theme is on identity—the biographical construction of identity and changing artistic reputations. I explore the theme in the analysis of different biographical/critical accounts of Fei Xiaolou and of an unusual edition of a popular morality book with illustrations by the artist. The second theme, which is centered on male portraits painted by Fei Xiaolou, is about the erosion of socioeconomic differences as societal factors that shaped practices among artists as well as editors and compilers. Most of the subjects, as mentors, friends and associates of the artist, were engaged with the tasks of research in philology and etymology, collecting and publishing books. Male portraits are interpreted as a gesture of self-fashioning and as illustrative of the importance of commemoration in pervasive encounter with death and mortality. Discussed also is the presence, in different ways, of historical women in the lives of male subjects portrayed in or involved in other ways with these portraits. The third integrating theme is about desire as a complex creative force in the early nineteenth century.

304725833,"Claypool, Lisa Rae",Figuring the body: Painting manuals in late imperial China,Modern,"The famous Mustard Seed Garden painting manuals ( Jieziyuan huazhuan ) were published serially in southern China from 1679, but only in the nineteenth century did the first two manuals strictly dedicated to the painting of figures become available on the market. Published in 1818 and 1897, the manuals effectively bracket a period of rapid and often violent socio-economic and political upheaval. They are almost completely dissimilar in look and content. Yet they share one critical point of commonality: the editors make a determined effort to explicate the human figure, to fully disclose it, to make it seen and knowable through textual and diagrammatic representations. The aim of my dissertation is two-fold: to explore the manual as an object in circulation and the possible range of readings it invited (some intended by its editors, others perhaps not). and to explore the regulation of pictorial representations of the body. Both efforts demonstrate the importance of the manual to identity construction in the nineteenth century. I begin by considering the manual as an important means by which the editors, Ding Yicheng early in the century, and later, Chao Xun, defined themselves and their social roles as artists. Next, I analyze the organization of pictures in the manuals and trace their visual sources. Keeping the spatial dimension of the manuals in mind—the space opened up between reader and book during the performance of reading—I compare the earlier manual to a library space, the later one to the space of a museum. Finally, I turn to the essay, “Secrets of Portraiture” ( xiezhen mijue ) published in both editions of the manual. This exploration delves into the history of physiognomy, the uses to which physiognomic theory were put in art, and the social and political stresses of everyday life on “physiognomic” vision. In addition, I examine an uneasy consonance between depictions of fictional characters in drama and popular novels with portraits. The narrative of regulation, I argue, only makes sense in a visual context in which subjectivity of the individual seems to have lost its (bodily) moorings.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, China, Figure painting, Imperial, Nineteenth century, Painting manuals",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304311944,"Tsao, Hsingyuan",From appropriation to possession: A study of the cultural identity of the Liao through their pictorial art,Pre-modern,"This is a study of painting produced under the Liao dynasty (907-1125), founded in the northern area of China by the Qidans (Khitans), a people of nomadic origin. Extant scroll paintings attributed to Liao artists have gone largely unstudied because of lack of criteria for determining authorship and date. Recent excavations of numerous Liao tombs, however, have yielded a large body of mural painting that can serve as comparative material, along with objects of Liao material culture that permit identification of things represented in the paintings. Several works ascribed to the Liao artists Hu Gui and Li Zanhua are examined in this new light, and conclusions reached about whether they are authentic Liao productions or misattributed paintings by Han Chinese artists. The tomb mural paintings themselves are examined both as works of art and for what they reveal about Liao society and culture, far beyond what the meagre written records provide. In particular, the Four Seasons landscape murals of the Qingling Imperial Mausoleum are given wholly new interpretations, which offer a key to understanding a famous pair of paintings representing Deer in an Autumn Forest. More importantly, this is a study of how the Qidans used art as a means of defining and asserting their cultural identity, especially in their relations with their main rivals, the sedentary Han Chinese who occupied the central plain region as the Sung dynasty. The Han Chinese traditionally regarded the neighboring nomadic peoples as barbarians and inferiors, consistently misrepresenting them in poetry and art. Most Chinese and foreign historians have accepted this version implicitly, seeing the nomadic powers who successively ruled the northern regions as having been sinicized and assimilated. This dissertation offers a different account, in which the culture of the Qidans (and, by extension, the other conquest dynasties) becomes an integral part of Chinese civilization. A newly-defined concept of what is Chinese results, richer and more diverse than the narrow traditional one. A careful tracing of the development of Liao pictorial style leads to recognition of the distinctive contributions of the Qidans in art, and how these were accepted by the Han Chinese.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, China, Hu Gui, Li Zanhua, Qidans",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304453874,"Wang, Qingping",The commercial production of the early Qing scholar-beauty romances,Modern,"This dissertation studies the commercial production of the genre of Chinese romantic action known as caizi jiaren xiaoshuo, or scholar-beauty romances. Attempting to discover why and how the genre came into being and became popularized in early Qing times, I investigate the products, the people involved, and the process of production in nine chapters. Chapter 1 defines, classifies, and dates the genre, illustrating how these romances constituted a new and highly popular affection genre in early Qing China. Chapter 2 investigates the formation of the genre, demonstrating that its emergence and prevalence were direct outcomes of commercialism. Chapter 3 examines the physical format of these novels, showing that they were well-designed cultural commodities made for profit. Chapter 4 determines the authorship of these romances by using a stylistic method. Based on these results, Chapters 5 and 6 explore the lives and social status of the writers, publishers, and readers, demonstrating that they were mainly frustrated middle- and lower-class intellectuals living in the Jiangnan area during the early Qing Dynasty. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 explore the interactions between fiction creation and various social factors. Chapter 7 demonstrates that these romances were the outcome of the successful interaction between popular literature and the printing industry. Chapter 8 reveals commercial strategies that affected fiction production, examining publishing houses, the producer-city Suzhou, and business relationships. Chapter 9 demonstrates that the producers' education and purposes for writing determined their works' content. This dissertation argues that, under the influence of commercialism and with the conquest of the Manchus in the early Qing period, a special group of intellectuals in the Jiangnan area became professional fiction producers or business-oriented partners. Having both literary and commercial motives, they created this fiction genre by shifting the traditional subject matter from other literary genres to a new genre of middle-length, vernacular novels. This new genre was evidence of a tendency in Chinese fiction production to specialize, a tendency promoted by business notions of increasing efficiency and by the limited productivity of the small-scale printing industry.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Economic history, History, China, Commercial production, Qing, Romances, Scholar-beauty romances",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304809762,"Shang, Kela",Visualizing social spaces: Site and situation in Xiang Shengmo's (1597–1658) art,Modern,"Focusing on the interplay between visual production and social formation, this dissertation looks into the ways in which Xiang Shengmo's art responded to an ensemble of dynamic social relations. Acknowledging that social situations are decidedly both plural and transient, this study intends to closely examine these social interactions as case studies. The four chapters interrogate varied sites and situations with which the artist was grappling, through social networking and artistic representation. The fabric of Xiang Shengmo's social space was woven with wildly diverse threads, including, but not limited to, obligations and opportunities, alienation and atonement, contestation and compromise, and aspiration and anxiety. The central concern of my dissertation does not sit squarely on Xiang the artist per se , but goes deep into the various social arenas within which he found himself, and his engagement with these particular situations. The diverse arenas of Xiang's social negotiation discussed include interregional cultural networks, local elite societies, family heritage, and self-positioning through self-portraiture. The study begins by examining Xiang's strategic associations with Dong Qichang and Li Rihua. Through contextualizing Xiang's affiliations within the bigger picture of regionalist contestation in the late Ming, I explore how and why his interregional network transformed over time. The same consciousness of locality loomed large in local Jiaxing elites' efforts to promote distinctive regional art and culture. Xiang contributed his painting and poetry to this enterprise and advanced his own career in the meantime. The enterprise of place-making, the combined creation of site-cum-sight, was prominent in contemporary garden culture. Around Freeing Crane Islet, apocryphal narrative was concocted and, through Xiang's painting, immortalized. Self-portraiture was a socially conscious art form as evidenced in Xiang's self-portrayals. Rather than a personal space secluded from social contingency, Xiang's self-portrayals were as responsive and instrumental to the evolving social space as his works in other genres. Although not always triumphant, Xiang's engagement with social spaces, lodged in particular sites and situations, proved to be proactive, interactive, and at times, retroactive.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, American history, Art, China, Social spaces, Visualizing, Xiang, Shengmo",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304999976,"Chen, Liana",Ritual into play: The aesthetic transformations of Qing court theatre,Modern,"Theatre played an important role in the formation of Qing court culture during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Performances associated with court activities took many forms, ranging from spectacular pageantries during ceremonies to small-scale performances in private residences in the Forbidden City. Using archival materials of the Qing court, diaries and random jottings by officials and foreign visitors who participated in such theatrical activities, and newly excavated dramatic texts, this dissertation charts the aesthetic trajectory of the Qing court theatre from the Qianlong to Daoguang reigns. It examines the social and political systems that shaped and supported Qing court theatre and the dialectic relationships between drama and ritual. Chapter one surveys the social and aesthetic foundations of Qing court theatre, grounding the cultural significances of court theatre in the interactions among the ideological principles of the imperial court, its administrative responsibilities, and the artists and staff in charge of the performances. Chapter two examines the pedagogical role of theatrical performances in state-sponsored ceremonial events during the Qianlong reign. Theatrical performances during the guest ritual process served not only as intangible rewards for the foreign emissaries, but also as a venue for the Qing court to project the idealized relationship between the ruler and its subject. Chapter three addresses itself broadly to the question of monumentality and imperial rule and specifically to the ways in which reinventions of ceremonial drama participated in the Jiaqing emperor's endeavor to create a new imperial self-image. Chapter four turns to the reconfiguration of the court theatre during the Daoguang reign and its impact on the development of ceremonial dramas. The shift from showcasing the collective to individual artistic achievements and the strengthening of entertainment value of the ceremonial dramas were most likely a result of the increasingly frequent and productive exchanges between court and popular theatres. Qing court theatre was mobilized to accommodate the ideological requirements of empire-building and the emperors' perceived needs for various displays of their power and benevolence. Further, the dramatic texts for theatrical performances on ceremonial occasions are far from monotonous or predetermined. The exchanges between court and professional theatre troupes in the late-nineteenth century shaped the aesthetic development of the ceremonial programs of the court theatre. The process of retooling court theatre transformed it from a vehicle for imperial ideology to a venue of artistic innovation that featured individual actor's talents. This study demonstrates the central place of theatre in Qing court life and the theatricality of imperial power bookended by ritual and entertainment.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Theater, China, Chinese theatre, Court culture, Entertainment, Entertainment culture, Late Imperial China, Qing, Qing history, Ritual",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
303780501,"Trumbull, Randolph",The Shanghai modernists,Contemporary,"This study describes the lives and art of five writers active in Shanghai during the twenties and thirties: Dai Wangshu (1905-1950), Du Heng (1907-1964), Liu Canbo (1900-1940), Mu Shiying (1912-1940), and Shi Shicun (born 1905). Introductory chapters explore the polyglot environment of Shanghai (curiously suited to the rise of Modernist art) and recount the circumstances of our writers' progress in life, education, and literature. We see them stumble in and out of the left-wing underground, then grow interested in Modernist art as typified by the work of Japan's New Perceptionists (Shinkankakuha) and numerous European and Soviet writers. We also document the rise of the Chinese Nationalists' policy of cultural interventionism, which hampered our writers somewhat in their various publishing ventures. Four middle chapters focus on the art of Liu, Shi, Dai, and Mu, drawing attention to the variety of their work. Liu Canbo analyzes the social turmoil of modern times, especially as concerns the sex lives of jaded urbanites. Shi Zhicun's art, sometimes gleaning inspiration from the black magic of old Chinese legends, revolves around psychoanalysis. Dai Wangshu's poetry constitutes a search for pining ladies and artfully flawed paradises. Mu Shiying, a wild prodigy who fills his texts with foreign words and unpunctuated monologues, paints the alienation of the Shanghainese nightclub crowd. Concluding chapters examine how and why Shanghai's League of Left-wing Writers came to target the Modernists for attack. Du Heng's role in the famous debate of 1932 and 1933 over literary freedom is described, and the dissolution of the Modernist group is traced to the general perception among Chinese intellectuals that Modernism was an unacceptably foreign and politically reactionary trend in the arts. Finally we consider the influence of Modernist and Post-Modernist art on artists in today's China, and speculate as to what role Modernist art might play in other non-Western nations.",1989,1989,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Literature, History, China, Dai Wangshu, Du Heng, Liu Canbo, Mu Shiying, Shi Zhicun",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States

Chapters one through four trace the trajectory of a network of Chan monks as they rose from obscurity to dominate the elite religious cultures of the kingdoms of Min, the Southern Tang, and Wuyue. The rise of Chan lineages, the dynamics of political patronage, and the effects of regionalism on the development of Buddhist communities are examined within the context of shifting political and economic conditions. Chapters five through seven investigate the social functions of Buddhist clerics and communities in southeastern China, with a focus on ancestral veneration, mortuary rites, the appropriation of religious relics, and cultural revival. In contrast to the largely salutary aspects of samgha-state relations detailed in the first seven chapters, the final chapter discusses the vociferous critiques of a group of Song dynasty literati who viewed the privileged place of monks and nuns within the regional courts of the southern kingdoms as detrimental to the proper functioning of government.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Religious history, History, Buddhist, Chan, China, Chinese Buddhism, Five Dynasties, Southeast China, Tenth century",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
3330000052,"Pawlowski, Anna",Sanctified Commodities: The Buddhist Paintings of Wu Bin (c. 1540 - 1626) and the Late Ming Buddhist Revival,Modern,"My dissertation intervenes in the current approaches to China's late Ming (c. 1572--1644) Buddhist revival by analyzing the paintings of the elite gentleman and devout lay Buddhist, Wu Bin (c. 1540--1626). As a lower-elite individual who maintained the aura of painting for leisure yet made his living with his brush, Wu Bin's life and works offer a new perspective on the late Ming Buddhist revival, outside of the current focus on official examination elites, famous monks, and the imperial family. In tracing the sociocultural environments, artistic choices, and reception of Wu Bin's Buddhist paintings, I first identify the Buddhist network of support that developed around significant temples in China, revealing an undiscovered motivation for the sixteenth-century rise in figure painting. I analyze Wu Bin's responses to this alternate form of support, investigating his donation of a set of 500 Luohans paintings to Nanjing's Qixia Temple and his self-fashioning of a deeply devout Buddhist persona. Then, turning to his key works, my research uncovers Wu Bin's engagement with broader late Ming discourse around the problematic nature of Buddhist visual representation. Wu Bin's paintings expose his responses to contemporaneous debates surrounding the incursion of images into traditionally textual spaces and the potential pitfalls of colorful images enticing the viewer away from a deeper understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Within the context of the sixteenth and seventeenth-century publishing boom, which helped create an audience steeped in Buddhist visual and doctrinal material, Wu Bin formulated engaging, efficacious images that embodied religious concepts as well as economic concerns. By realigning Wu Bin, an artist currently associated predominantly with landscape painting, into the contemporaneous understanding of him as primarily a Buddhist painter, my dissertation brings religious and art-historical methodological frameworks into dialogue, establishing a previously overlooked source for reconstructing the complex role of Buddhist painting and lived religion across wide cultural and social strata in early modern China.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Buddhist paintings, Wu Bin, Late Ming Buddhist Revival,",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
3980000065,"Hirata, Koji","Steel Metropolis: Industrial Manchuria and the Making of Chinese Socialism, 1916-1964",Contemporary,"Drawing upon archival and oral history sources in Chinese, Japanese, English, and Russian, this dissertation examines the transformation of twentieth-century China's largest steel enterprise and its urban environment: the Anshan Steel and Iron Works (Angang) located in the city of Anshan in Manchuria (Northeast China). During the early years of the People's Republic of China (PRC, 1949-), Angang produced fully half of China's steel, and was also the fourth largest steel enterprise in all of Asia. A symbol of the new socialist state as envisioned by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Angang was also one of the PRC's largest state-owned enterprises that formed the primary pillar of the socialist planned economy. While Soviet technological aid to Angang in the 1950s is well documented, far less known is Angang's genesis, which lay squarely in Japanese colonialism in Manchuria before 1945. This study traces the evolution of Angang and its urban environment in Anshan under the successive regimes of imperial Japan (1916-1945), the Soviet Union (1945- 1946), the Chinese Nationalist Party (1946-1948), and the CCP (1948-present). I challenge the widely held idea that the PRC's planned economy was inspired purely by Stalinist and Maoist visions. Instead, I contend that Chinese socialism also built upon the physical assets, human resources, and institutions left over from the Japanese and Nationalist war economies. Moreover, as under these previous regimes, lower-level officials and local residents often undermined the PRC's top-down efforts to transform the economy by re-interpreting the organizational and ideological rules set by the state for their own interests. Through a transnational microhistory of Angang and Anshan, my work offers a new framework for analyzing late-industrializing regimes of the twentieth century. I propose the concept of """"hyper-industrialism"""" to describe the global nexus of ideology on development that crossed the divide between socialism and capitalism. By hyper-industrialism, I refer to a strong faith in the state's ability to industrialize the economy through bureaucratic planning and dominant focus on heavy industry for increasing the nation's military strength. By analyzing how the tenets of hyper-industrialism were implemented on the ground, I also explain how people experienced state-led industrialization in their daily work and everyday life. The dissertation begins by exploring the pre-CCP origins of the socialist planned economy in Manchuria as epitomized by the rise of Angang under Japanese, Soviet, and Nationalist rule (Chapters 1-2). The core discussion focuses on the first phase of CCP rule between 1948 and 1957, especially the First Five-Year Plan (1953-1957). Specifically, chapters 3-6 examine the Japanese, Nationalist, and Soviet influences in the PRC's socialist industrialization; the early PRC's state-enterprise system; the planning and formation of the industrial city; and relationship between the CCP Party-State and Chinese citizens. The last chapter discusses the Great Leap Forward (1958-1961) and its impact on Chinese socialism.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"China, Sttelmaking, State-owned enterprises,",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
305001570,"Chen, Shu-Juo",How Han are Taiwanese Han? Genetic inference of Plains Indigenous ancestry among Taiwanese Han and its implications for Taiwan identity,Contemporary,"Taiwanese Han have been searching for new cultural or historical grounds upon which to resist Beijing's Keep Taiwan Chinese policies. Despite the fact that ancestors of most Taiwanese Han were immigrants from China during the last four hundred years, many Taiwanese Han have sought to establish a unique sense of identity expressed in the well-known folk saying: There were mainland grandfathers but no mainland grandmothers. They believe Taiwanese Han are genetically different from Chinese Han because the female ancestors of most Taiwanese Han were not Han, but Plains Indigenes, a group of Taiwan Austronesian speakers. The proportion of Plains Indigenous ancestry among Taiwanese Han was not known before this study because Plains Indigenes are not officially recognized today. The ethnic labeling in the Japanese household registry is the most conclusive reliable resource to identify Plains Indigenes. In this thesis, Plains Indigenes identified from the Japanese household registry and censuses are sampled and genotyped. A genetic distinction between Plains Indigenes and Taiwanese Han is confirmed by their Y chromosome and mtDNA variations. The great number of Han immigrants after the 18 th century is the main reason to consider that the early genetic contribution from Plains Indigenes to Taiwanese Han has been largely diluted and no longer exists in any meaningful way. However, Taiwan blood nationalists and some geneticists have misinterpreted the genetic evidence and misled people in Taiwan into believing the opposite. The myth of Indigenous genes—the belief that the majority of people in Taiwan have Indigenous ancestors—is widely accepted. Taiwan blood nationalists have called for Taiwan's independence based on this myth. The descendants of Plains Indigenes are extremely opposed to using their ancestors in such calls for Taiwan independence. In efforts to revive their traditional culture, maintaining group solidarity among their villagers is more important than differentiating the ancestral origins of village members. Keep the Village Siraya is important in the propaganda used in their appeals for official recognition. While Taiwan blood nationalists use Plains Indigenous ancestors as a template to create a Taiwan nation based on blood, the value of Plains Indigenous ancestors is destroyed by their descendants. Plains Indigenes and Taiwan blood nationalists have different cultural and socioeconomic contexts and the significance of having unique ancestral origins based on blood is treated totally differently. However, no one can deny that the Plains Indigenes have the highest authority to define the values attributed to their ancestors' blood. In this struggle, the denial of the importance of ancestors' blood also destroys the importance of genetic evidence. The claim of Plains Indigenous ancestry among Taiwanese Han becomes socially meaningless.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, Physical anthropology, History, Ancestry, Anthropological genetics, China, Demography, Ethnic identity, Genetic inference, Han, Nationalism, Plains Indigenous, Taiwan",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
305293378,"Li, Mu Yang","Essays on public finance and economic *development in a historical institutional perspective: China, 1840–1911",Contemporary,"While internal political order, regional dominance, and economic prosperity prevailed in early 19 th -century China, in the decades after 1840, China experienced a series of external political crises, unprecedented internal rebellions, and economic stagnation. In particular, fiscal stability and adequacy in the early period had given way to modest revenue growth that fell short of surging government expenditure needs. In this dissertation, I adopt a game-theoretical approach to interpret such contrasting political and economic outcomes as manifestations of an underlying political and economic equilibrium. Namely, taxation by bureaucracy functioned as a rent-seeking device through which the Qing both pre-empted political opposition and mobilized fiscal resources. At the same time, cultural beliefs coordinating rural taxpayers enforced property rights against excessive, arbitrary extralegal taxation and sustained economic growth for the long run. The centrality of such beliefs implied institutionalized inflexibilities. Using comparative statics analysis, I explain fiscal development in the late Qing period—stagnant land tax revenue, rise of commercial taxation, and its limited revenue-generating capacity—as equilibrium responses to exogenous fiscal shocks. I apply the insights from the model to the puzzling pattern of guild growth in the late Qing. By embedding guild development in the context of profound fiscal changes of the period—the rising importance of revenue from commerce and the Qing's increasing difficulty in administering viable commercial taxation—I interpret the accelerated growth of late Qing guilds and their expanding sphere of influence as outcomes of a self-reinforcing equilibrium. On the one hand, tax farming enabled guilds to protect members' property rights and sustained likin revenue for the long run. on the other hand, the success of tax farming reinforced guilds' internal cohesion and enhanced guild power. Finally, I explore the implications of late Qing's fiscal stagnation for China's economic development. I substantiate the claim that the lack of fiscal resources greatly hindered China's industrialization in this period. By failing to ensure macroeconomic stability and aggressively promote infrastructure development, capital formation, and technology transfer, the Qing provided little badly needed impetus for the Chinese economy to overcome capital market imperfections and engage in industrial growth.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Economic history, Economics, History, China, Development, Public finance, Qing dynasty",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304468197,"Mei, Yun-chiu",The pictorial mapping and imperialization of epigraphic landscapes in eighteenth-century China,Modern,"Compiled in 1771 to document Manchu emperors' southern processions, Magnificent Ceremonies of the Southern Inspection Tours can be considered an imperialistic campaign that aimed at placing Qing imperial patrimonies and monuments, such as temporary palaces and stele pavilions, on the tourist map and promoting them as cultic objects for the masses to worship. Probably inspired by this mapping project, the literati artist Huang Yi (1744–1802) created a series of topographic paintings to record ancient steles during his archaeological expeditions in northern China. These mapping projects were, in fact, visual representations of two competing movements in the eighteenth century. One was Han-Chinese literati's collective effort to museumize long forgotten ancient steles and advocate them as alternative models to challenge the calligraphic orthodoxy, known as tiexue (model-book calligraphy). The other was the Qing court's mass construction of new steles to monumentalize the tiexue tradition and imperialize China's physical and cultural landscape. Driven by such ambitions, the court produced an array of war memorials to celebrate successful military campaigns along borderlands and deliberately misplaced them in the empire-wide institution for civil education, or the system of government schools and Confucian temples. By installing these military monuments in civil institutions, the court transgressed the long-standing boundary between the civil and military realm and subverted the traditional Han-Chinese values that privileged civil merits over military ones. Concurrently, numerous steles were erected to commemorate imperial tours. Inscribed with lyrical poems by Manchu emperors, these steles spread from one popular scenic site to another and intruded into a leisure landscape that had long been monopolized by literati-travelers to immortalize their on-site travel literature. The Qing monuments not only physically and symbolically reshaped the landscape, but also altered the original image of imperial steles as rare and mysterious monoliths. Their omnipresence and their availability to the public transformed them into a new form of mass communication and propaganda. Chinese literati's efforts to restore the legacy of ancient monuments might have been a countermeasure against such excessive use of steles by the court to regain their dominance over the physical and cultural space of China's historic sites.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Art history, Calligraphy, China, Confucian temples, Eighteenth century, Epigraphy, Huang, Yi, Landscapes, Qianlong emperor, Steles",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States

I argue that the visualizations of a city are products of mercantile culture, bureaucratic practices, commercial enterprises, imperial agendas, and above all, the visual politics between the imperial court and local society. Following the trajectory of images depicting Suzhou, the most prosperous city in eighteenth-century China, this dissertation analyzes how local commercial culture transformed images of this city from representations of suburban scenery to cityscapes of urban prosperity and how this shift was then appropriated for and overseen by the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736-1795). After examining representations of Suzhou, I also consider how the imperial projection of the capital of Beijing was shaped by imperial and local interactions and by the visual politics between the political and commercial centers of the Qing empire (1644-1911), namely the capital and the provincial metropolis of Suzhou. The interactive production of cityscapes from the two cities demonstrates how a dynamic network of local and imperial exchange altered not only representations of a provincial city but also the visual politics in which the court was transformed from an absolute supremacy to a still-dominant power that had to respond to the economic center of the empire.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Art history, China, Cityscapes, Eighteenth century, Suzhou, Visual politics",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States

As it was a common practice for the term xingle tu to be used indiscriminately during the early Qing dynasty, I deliberately avoid this term and the confusion it may cause in this dissertation. By articulating the active role painted portraits played in influencing the Kangxi emperor's (r. 1661-1722) selection of his successor, this project advances contemporary understanding of a long-debated historical problem surrounding the legitimacy of Prince Yinzhen's enthronement. The reconstruction of the Yongzheng emperor's painting academy through records from the archives of the Office of Manufacture and Procurement fills a significant gap in the literature on Qing imperial art. The so-called masquerade portraits albums portray the Yongzheng emperor performing personages from different cultures, regions, and religions. The role that these portrait albums played in the Yongzheng emperor's religious pursuits was twofold. The first aspect was their ability to assist the emperor in imagining his transformation into other human beings. Secondly, these albums provide a visual experience that metaphorically enacted doubts about the nature of human existence. The perceptual experience mirrored important questions for Chan Buddhism. in the end, they must have finally enhanced the Yongzheng emperor's understanding of the notion of ultimate emptiness and offered hopes for enlightenment.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Art history, China, Legitimacy, Masquerade portrait, Political advancement, Portraiture, Qing court painting, Transcendence, Xingle tu, Yinzhen, Yongzheng emperor",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States

Yet it is a subject that has received little attention from modern Chinese historians. Focusing on life in the occupied city of Shanghai, my dissertation aims to correct a standard vision of intellectual submissiveness and confusion under occupation by explicating the moral and political concerns of writers in Shanghai during the difficult time. After its fall to Japan in November 1937, Shanghai underwent two phases of occupation. The first phase was distinguished by a partial occupation, known as the period of Solitary Island (gudao), which lasted from 1937 to December 1941. From 1941 to 1945, the whole Shanghai was occupied. During these eight years of occupation, writers became the chief targets of political violence. The major concern of writers in this situation was to develop an appropriate stance towards the occupying force. They sought to resolve the dilemma between private and public morality: on the one hand patriotic commitment, and on the other the need for survival. Confronted with these choices, writers turned to their past for references by which they could make sense of the present. In particular, they searched for patterns, allegories and analogies in history to help define their political and moral stance. China's past offers myriad examples of comparable crisis (e.g., the Ming-Qing transition). These historical experiences had coalesced into three cultural paradigms in terms of which traditional literati defined their behavior in times of disorder: eremitism, loyalism, and collaboration. Echoing this tripartite mode of choice, writers in Shanghai conceived a triad of responses to the Japanese occupation: passivity, resistance, and collaboration. Each of these responses entailed a discourse which involved a set of ideas and images with respect to self, others, and society. My dissertation analyzes the ways in which these writers conceptualized and evaluated the three modes of response, as well as the ways in which they related such processes of thought to their ultimate choices. These questions will help us apprehend the complexity and ambiguity of the intellectual life in occupied Shanghai.",1989,1989,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, China",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304453925,"Meyer-Fong, Tobie Sarah",Site and sentiment: Building culture in seventeenth-century Yangzhou,Modern,"This dissertation explores the processes of physical and cultural reconstruction that occurred in the Chinese city of Yangzhou between 1645 and 1700. Largely destroyed in 1645 during the Qing conquest, the city emerged as a prosperous mercantile center during the mid-eighteenth century. While the city's later economic and cultural successes have received much scholarly attention, the period of recovery has been almost entirely ignored. Throughout the thesis, I focus on the values associated with the physical construction and cultural use of buildings. Therefore, this project is about one kind of recovery, the reassembling of the sites and sensibilities that were meant to mark the distinctiveness of elite culture. It is a study of the effects of catastrophe on a society and the rapid cultural reactions that respond to rupture and loss. It charts the emergence of a sense of community among local elites, travellers, officials, and refugees. It is thus an exploration of the self-conscious building and rebuilding of community and culture expressed symbolically through physical reconstruction. Each of the three central chapters focuses on a particular site. The second chapter explores the emergence of Red Bridge as an important site through the intervention of the young Qing official Wang Shizhen. This chapter addresses the formation of patronage networks through which Qing officials supported Ming loyalists and other political outsiders. In Chapter Three, I look at the construction of the Tower of Literary Selection (Wenxuan lou). This site was the temporary home of Deng Hanyi (1617-1689) as he compiled the Shiguan (Poetic Views), an anthology of contemporary poetry. The chapter explores the parallel functions of the site and the anthology. Both commemorated and provided context for elite literary and social activities. The fourth chapter deals with the reconstruction of Pingshan Hall at the behest of Wang Maolin, a project that symbolized elite reconciliation and recovery. In the final chapter, I explore the changing relationship between the imperial court and the locale, highlighting the impact of the Kangxi and Qianlong emperor's Southern Tours on the local landscape.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, Cultural anthropology, Building culture, China, Kangxi, Qing dynasty, Seventeenth century, Yangzhou",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
1550513497,"Vanden Bussche, Eric","Contested realms: Colonial rivalry, border demarcation, and state-building in Southwest China, 1885-1960",Contemporary,"Scholarship on modern Chinese state-building has tended to focus on the ethnically Han areas of China proper, especially coastal metropoles such as Shanghai, Guangzhou and Tianjin and, more recently, China's Inner Asian borderlands: Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai and Inner Mongolia. This dissertation widens the scope of inquiry by attending to the particularities of state-building and nationalism in the Southwest peripheries such as Yunnan, a place that has been considered part of China proper but is distinct from eastern and coastal parts of the country. Ever since its incorporation into the Ming empire (1368-1644), Yunnan has been one of China's most complicated border regions. Its diverse ethnic inhabitants scattered across the mountainous terrain, the effects of malaria on conquering armies, the strong commercial ties with Southeast Asia and the practice of indirect rule continuously hindered state efforts in securing an administrative and military foothold in a region known for its mineral wealth. This dissertation examines the contested nature of a demarcation process that, in the case of the Sino-Burmese border, unfolded over more than seven decades as China transitioned from a pluralistic empire to casting itself as a modem nation-state. While historiography on China's border disputes has tended to be a unidirectional narrative emphasizing the efforts of a central government in extending its administrative control and ascribing national belonging to local inhabitants, this dissertation characterizes demarcation as a multidirectional process influenced by global transformations, regional networks and local alliances. I argue that a periphery shouldn't be strictly understood as a place, but rather as a multilayered geographical space molded by the coexistence of diverse peoples and centers of power. Throughout the decades-long Sino-Burmese border dispute, the region constituted a space of interaction between various Chinese political regimes, British colonialists, and local actors that influenced China's nation- building process. Using an array of sources – some recently declassified – this dissertation examines the role that border demarcation played in three pivotal components of state-building from 1886 to 1960: (1) China's entrance into the international system of nation-states. (2) the downward extension of administrative control into the locality. and (3) the reconceptualization of the Chinese people in ways that would encompass rather than exclude the diverse, non-Han peoples living along the frontiers. In doing so, I also engage with research in the history of cartography and comparative colonialisms.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Border Demarcation, Cartography, China, Comparative Colonialism",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
303869996,"Goodman, Bryna","The native place and the city: Immigrant consciousness and organization in Shanghai, 1853-1927",Contemporary,"This study, The Native Place and the City: Immigrant Organization and Social Consciousness in Shanghai, 1853-1927, focuses on social organization and order-keeping below the level of the city government, in the metropolitan area of Shanghai. This involves the study of the development of both an idea and a set of institutions--native place sentiment and the fellow-countrymen associations that grew out of it to protect immigrants' interests in the commercial and social networks of the city. Historians and anthropologists have long recognized that immigrants dominated the social, economic, cultural and political life of China's modernizing commercial centers. This thesis examines how they did so--what organizational and normative structures immigrants created in Shanghai. The case of Shanghai reveals that networks of fellow-provincials transcended urban boundaries and thereby constituted larger, integrated inter-urban communities of local self-interest. The study begins by examining the prominence of native place associations in the Small Sword Uprising of 1853. Just prior to this incident, city authorities requested the directors of major huiguan to establish militia for the defense of the city. It was these militia, organized according to native place affiliation, which took over the city. This incident underlines the importance of questions regarding the nature of native place sentiment and native place organization which are raised in the chapters which follow. In the course of the examination of a series of wide-ranging incidents in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Shanghai, the dissertation connects the official and unofficial functions of native place institutions and uncovers links between the merchant elite and the larger native place community. The study considers in particular, the ways in which huiguan leaders manipulated mass-based movements through the huiguan's position at the top of a nested hierarchy of native place associations. Whereas many studies of Chinese cities cease to examine native place organization in the late nineteenth century, I extend the study into the modern period. The final chapter includes an examination of native place organization underlying both expressions of popular nationalism and expressions of class conflict in the republican period. Native place loyalties not only did not conflict with the expression of nationalism but rather provided natural and necessary units of organization. Similarly, native place organization complicated but did not preclude class formation. In conclusion, the dissertation suggests the utility of studying traditional associations in moments noted for their radical modernity.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, China",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
305129057,"Fei, Si-Yen",Negotiating urban space: The making and remaking of the southern metropolis in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century China,Modern,"This dissertation studies the changing urban space in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century China through the case of Nanjing in three dimensions, as an urban community, as a region, and as an imagined community. One central paradox informs this work: how, in the only dynasty that defined cities administratively as an extension of the countryside despite significant commercialization and urbanization, did the people of Nanjing experience, perceive, and (re)build their own city? I approach this question by exploring three movements at the turn of seventeenth century: a grass-roots drive for urban corvée reform that reconfigured the spatial structure of Nanjing city. a popular protest against building city walls in neighboring counties under the name of guarding Nanjing. and the marked increase in written and visual representations of Nanjing city by a close-knit group of Nanjing literati. These movements, led and participated in by Nanjing elites, county gentry, and urban residents, reveal the ways in which these social groups perceived and experienced Nanjing: its spatial make-up, social boundaries, and its cultural representations. This study of late Ming Nanjing challenges many modern assumptions about “traditional cities” that are embedded in Chinese urban historiography by demonstrating how the meaning of “city” was rediscovered, disputed, and reconceived in the making of the southern metropolis.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, China, Metropolis, Ming dynasty, Nanjing, Seventeenth century, Sixteenth century, Urban space",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
305433988,"Wang, Juan","The weight of frivolous matters: Shanghai tabloid culture, 1897–1911",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines popular Shanghai “tabloids” between 1897 and 1911, a type of increasingly mass-targeted newspaper that was meant primarily to be entertaining. A mix of scandal, gossip, literary game playing, serially produced novels and stories, and political parody and commentaries, these publications reached beyond an audience with high literary skills to an audience of middling literary abilities. This dissertation engages a long ignored subject, namely, the role played by popular media in political change during the late Qing. Historians have hitherto focused on intellectual and institutional forces that conditioned the fall of the Qing. however, little attention has been given to the popular assimilation of lofty ideas of reform and to popular perceptions as a part of those conditions. My thesis is that Shanghai's tabloids, with their daring breach of political, social and moral boundaries, created a “public culture” of unprecedented openness and tolerance that eroded Qing authority and its power of persuasion. This culture, shaped in turn by the social and political changes of the time, presaged the seemingly sudden collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and made it palatable to the general public. The dissertation has a prologue and five chapters. In the prologue, I define source materials and terms that I use in research and writing. Chapter 1 introduces the tabloid literati and their tabloids. Chapter 2 examines how tabloid literati made the pursuit of fun and play a cultural fetish for their readers, and how they lived as the exemplars of that culture. Chapter 3 examines how tabloid literati, through their cynicism and humor, fashioned a sense of “public” anxiety and skepticism concerning contemporary society and Qing authority. Chapter 4 examines how their commercial interests dominated what and how they produced, and how they acted as entrepreneurs and cultural brokers in the pursuit of fame and profit. Chapter 5 analyzes the acute political, social, economic and intellectual alienation felt by low-rank literati. It analyzes how tabloid literati helped to cultivate a profound “public consciousness” and a shared feeling that the Qing regime was no longer trustworthy, reliable, and capable as a government.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, China, Qing dynasty, Shanghai, Tabloid culture",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304060759,"Millward, James Andrew","Beyond the pass: Commerce, ethnicity and the Qing Empire in Xinjiang, 1759-1864",Modern,"This dissertation examines the workings of empire in Xinjiang from the conquest by the Manchu Qing dynasty in 1759 until the Tungan rebellions in Gansu and Xinjiang severed the region from central control in 1864. Through consideration of domestic commerce and ethnic policy, I argue that because of the tenuous fiscal basis of Qing rule in Xinjiang, the Manchu authorities in the region came to rely increasingly upon Chinese (Han and Chinese Muslim, or Tungan) merchants as a source of logistical supply, tax and rent revenue, emergency financing, and even auxiliary forces in wartime. The guarded welcome with which the dynasty in the mid-eighteenth century encouraged Chinese merchants to sojourn in Xinjiang gave way by the 1830s to officially promoted migration and permanent settlement of Chinese throughout the region, including Muslim Altishahr. A pro-Han stance arose, aimed at consolidating the Qing frontier in Xinjiang in the face of East Turkestani unrest and Kokand-sponsored invasion. Part I focuses on the fiscal underpinnings of Qing rule in Xinjiang, and discusses silk-for-horse trade with the Kazakhs, agricultural development, silver stipends and currency manipulation, official pawnbroking, commissaries and other government investments as well as commercial rents and taxation. Extra-budgetary sources of revenue helped support Manchu garrisons in Xinjiang, but led to government reliance on commerce and the Han merchants in this frontier region. Part II concerns private merchants and Qing policies toward Chinese mercantile activities in Xinjiang. Aspects examined include improvements in infrastructure and legal measures (which aided and restricted Chinese commercial penetration), the various merchant groups active in the trade between Xinjiang and China proper (East Turkestanis, Tungans and Han), the principal trade routes used, and the important trade in tea and jade. Through an analysis of Manchu, Han and East Turkestani positions and roles during the 1830 Kokand invasion, Part II concludes that Manchu and Han interests in southern Xinjiang had converged: the dynasty reversed its earlier approach to frontier administration and ethnic policy, and lifted its restrictions on permanent settlement in the region by Chinese with their dependents.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, China",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304095276,"Fan, I-chun","Long-distance trade and market integration in the Ming-Ch'ing period, 1400-1850",Modern,"Long distance trade is much celebrated in all economic history as a marker and measure of change. Local, regional, and national economies become linked, integration creates or redefines the structure and purposes of markets, producers and consumers imperceptibly become cosmopolitans, tax collectors enrich the state and themselves, and merchants link near and far in great commercial networks. The Chinese case is not exceptional. Long distance trade, both domestic and foreign, made great differences over gulfs of space and time. This we have known from descriptive and anecdotal evidence and from the force of logic and theory. But one looks in vain for quantitative evidence of these mighty secular shifts. If we are honest with ourselves, we shall need to admit that we have been operating largely on faith. It is the purpose of this study to change that, to provide a quantitative dimension to the qualitative assurance that China's commercial economy was more integrated at the transregional (and perhaps national) level in the late years of the 18th and early years of the 19th century than it was in the early 15th when the Ming first began to create customs houses to tax a growing trade. Mapping the internal trade routes as they grew in length and complexity and shifted in spatial orientation over the Ming-Ch'ing years is the first task at hand. Identifying and locating the mushrooming number of customs houses along the rivers and canals and coast of a burgeoning commercial empire is the second task, critical for a quantitative reading of change, for these taxing stations kept records of commodities in transit and revenues collected. The final chapters of the thesis function as a gloss of these spatial transformations, providing the empirical evidence of a complexifying long distance trade. The business of each customs house is treated in turn. I identify commodities in transit, their sources and destinations, their volumes and value, the tax levied, customs protocols, the inter-connections with other parts of the trading nexus. The entire project is lodged within the debates over the historicity of the so-called national market, and both here and in the conclusion I invoke the theories and arguments of the main contestants, the better to assess the contributions which a quantitative study such as this might make to the historiography of the field.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, China, trade",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
305008277,"Qi, Dongtao",The Taiwan Independence Movement in power: The dilemmas of a movement government,Contemporary,"The 20th century has witnessed many movement governments in former authoritarian states such as those in Taiwan, South Korea, Iran, and South Africa. This study is the first attempt in the literature of states and movements to conceptually distinguish movement governments from conventional democratic governments. It proposes an analytical framework of movement governments and then applies the framework to develop an alternative explanation about the lower social support for the DPP government in Taiwan at the end of its second administrative term in 2008. The movement government usually plays the dual roles of government and movement simultaneously, which often imposes significant strategic constraints on the government and damages its electoral performance because of the inherent tension between the two roles in electoral politics. Based on this framework and after analyzing the survey data of 2000, 2004, and 2008, this study finds that: (1) During 2000–2008, while the popular support for the DPP government had been stagnated and then declining, the support for the Taiwan Independence Movement had been generally increasing and then remained stable. Furthermore, at the individual level, although individuals' dissatisfaction with the DPP government's performance significantly reduced their support for the DPP, it had no net effect on their support for the Taiwan Independence Movement in 2008. (2) During 2000–2008, the DPP government changed its strategy on important movement issues from concession to confrontation in its first term and finally to radicalization in its second term. The radical movement strategy successfully reduced the negative impact of the government's poor performance and President Chen's family corruption scandals on the movement fundamentalists' support for the DPP and President Chen. These fundamentalists were mostly elders, less educated, south Taiwan residents, and farmers. (3) However, the same radical movement strategy alienated many more moderates due to its highly contentious, ethnically divisive, illiberal, and undemocratic characteristics. These moderates mainly included younger, better educated, middle class, north and middle Taiwan residents. It was the withdrawing support of these moderates that finally reduced the overall popular support for the DPP in 2008.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Political science, Social structure, China, Cross-Strait relations, Democratic Progressive Party, Ethnic conflicts, Movement government, Social movement, States and movements, Taiwan",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
305583183,"Shinno, Reiko",Promoting medicine in the Yuan dynasty (1206–1368): An aspect of Mongol rule in China,Medieval,"This study examines the role of governmental institutions in creating a hospitable environment for medical practice in Yuan China (1206–1368). It shows that although the preceding Song government had already begun to take strong initiatives in the codifying of medical knowledge, the Yuan government developed this trend dramatically. This study also provides a case study in the understanding of the complex interactions among Mongols, Western and Central Asians, and Chinese during this period. Based on legal and administrative sources, local gazetteers, and literati writings dedicated to physicians, this dissertation examines four areas of Yuan institutional practice related to medicine. The Mongol rulers were particularly influential in creating a taxation and litigation category, “medical households” (Ch. 1) and in shaping the bureaucracy which bestowed higher prestige on and stronger political power to medical administrators (Ch. 2). In this context, Chinese officials expanded the local medical school system (Ch. 3), while endorsing the Temples of the Three Progenitors as integral components of the medical schools (Ch. 4). Each chapter discusses the relevant laws, the political processes through which they were shaped, and the degree of implementation they achieved. In order to explore the meaning of these institutions in people's lives, the fifth and last chapter describes the life of Yuan Jue (1260–327), a scholar-official who wrote dedicatory inscriptions for several medical schools and the Temples. The study suggests that creating a medical school-temple complex had culturally significant implications: medicine came to be considered learning ( xue ) in the Neo-Confucian mold. It could, in other words, be acquired by reading proper medical texts and emulating proper role models. Some prominent Neo-Confucian scholars during this period strongly argued that physicians could achieve the Way—cultural and spiritual fulfillment—by focusing on their occupational specialty, now regarded as a gentlemanly pursuit. This dissertation agrees with a previous study that more elites entered medicine in the Yuan than in the Song. However, I argue that this was so not just because elites may have had fewer occupational options, but because medical practice had become a more accessible and attractive option than it had in the earlier times.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"History, Science history, China, Medicine, Mongol, Yuan dynasty",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304727956,"Lipkin, Zwia","Keeping up appearances: The Nanjing municipal government and the city's elements déclassés, 1927–1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation frames urban history as a tension between municipal expectations and possibilities. It examines the decade-long process of turning Nanjing, a slow-paced, provincial city, into the capital of the Republic of China. By looking at the evolution of municipal policies towards specific groups of lower-class people—prostitutes, refugees, the local poor, beggars, and slum dwellers—I examine Nationalist attempts at social engineering as well as efforts to create a national self-consciousness. Nanjing was to be constructed as a modern, model city, an ideal capital that had no room for the underclasses and the problems they posed. The underclasses, however, were the vast majority of the city's population, and their existence could not be ignored. The municipal government, therefore, had constantly to negotiate the gap between ideals and reality, its own goals and the needs of its population. In this process, appearances became crucial. Nanjing could be a capital only if it looked like one. In the early years of the Nanjing Decade, policies attempted to create an impressive facade at the expense of the population. The government tried to push undesirable elements out of sight. Beggars in the spring of 1928 were told to vanish in three days, whereas fortune-tellers and prostitutes were given an ultimatum to change profession or be expelled. In the later years of the decade, after these attempts failed, the government had to find more profound solutions, which combined social reform with welfare. Circumstances counteracted the city's efforts, and it could never implement its plans on a large-enough scale. Although the government had fairly clear goals, it did not know how to realize them, nor had the means to do so. It had similar objectives for various groups of lower class people, yet did not adopt uniform policies to deal with them. State power was multi-faceted: inclusive of some groups and exclusive of others. The same people, categorized in different groups, were subjected to different treatment.

304453295,"Jiang, Jin","Women and public culture: Poetics and politics of women's Yue opera in Republican Shanghai, 1930s-1940s",Contemporary,"Women's Yue opera was a popular theatrical form in which all roles were played by actresses for a largely female audience. The opera first started as an all-girls' theater in the countryside of Shengxian, Zhejiang province, in the early 1920s. It became extremely popular in Shanghai in the 1930s and 1940s and then spread throughout the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in the 1950s and 1960s. In the course of a half-century, a traditional art form was reshaped by modern conditions to become an important part of an emerging urban mass culture. One of the most important factors in the formation of such a modern culture in Republican Shanghai was women's entrance into the cultural market. Women's entrance into the opera market, both as consumers and producers, was central to the transformation of the male-dominated opera culture of the Qing Dynasty to a female-centered one in the twentieth century. Women's opera was the single most important case of women's entrance into the urban entertainment market. Tracing the emergence and transformation of women's Yue opera in the context of revolution, war, and nation building, this dissertation examines women's views and experience in a rapidly changing semi-colonial urban society and women's roles in shaping the public culture of modern Shanghai. Chapter One describes the rise of the actress in the period's cultual conflict between a traditional popular eroticism focused on the public women's sexuality and a reformist ideology that considered the cleansing of this popular eroticism to be part of the modern nation-building task. Chapter Two examines the poetics of women's opera developed in a dynamic of social and political changes in urban Shanghai. Chapter Three studies the formation of a mass audience of popular entertainment, and the female audience and patrons of women's opera. Chapter Four investigates the relationship between women's opera actresses and the left-wing intellectuals and the transformation of the actresses into mainstream media heroines in postwar Shanghai.

3380000053,"Seeley, Joseph Andrew","Liquid Geography: The Yalu River and the Boundaries of Empire in East Asia, 1894-1945",Medieval,"This dissertation examines imperial Japan's efforts to transform and control the Yalu River boundary between Korea and Manchuria (Northeast China) during the period 1894-1945. Following the Japanese colonization of Korea in 1910, the Yalu River, together with the neighboring Tumen River, formed the longest formal, non-maritime border of the Japanese Empire until its dissolution in 1945. Yet despite the Yalu's strategic significance in the imperialist politics of early twentieth-century Northeast Asia, its modern history has been surprisingly overlooked. I address this historiographical gap while making three key interventions in the larger scholarship on borders, climate history, and Japanese imperialism. First, by drawing on archival materials in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and English, I argue that dynamic environments like the Yalu are more than mere backdrops to border histories, but co-agents of border creation and contestation alongside local human residents. A focus on what I call the liquid geography of the Yalu border shows how the transnational flow of people, goods, and the river itself exposed the limits of the colonial state even while providing the material underpinnings for further imperial expansion. Second, in analyzing the river as an agent of history, I propose a new, seasonal approach to history. Controlling the movement of peoples and goods across the Yalu meant contending with winter ice, summer floods, and other aspects of a seasonally changing riparian geography. Third and finally, I challenge conventional understanding of the political unity of the Japanese empire in Asia. I show how the internal contradictions of Japan's imperial project, as well as its external challenges, were most glaringly exposed along fault lines like the Yalu River border.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Japan, Yalu River boundary, Korea, Manchuria, 1894-1945, Imperialism,",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
3080000047,"Lee, Hsinyi Tiffany",Through a National Lens: The Art and Politics of Photography in Republican China,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the ascent of photography to the status of fine art in a time of heightened national consciousness in Republican China (1912--1949). It focuses on the formative period of pictorial photography, from the first public photographic art exhibition in the late 1910s through 1937, when the outbreak of Sino-Japanese war brought art photography in China to a standstill. Through integrated analyses of photographs, artist writings, and period press accounts, this study argues that Chinese photographers developed an acute awareness of their dual positions behind the camera: as modern artists, and as members of a fledgling nation still forging an identity within a new global politics. When Chinese photographers began to participate in the international art movement of pictorialism, tension between these two roles peaked as these camera artists strove to create a distinctive photographic identity for China. Bringing together Chinese, Japanese, and English-language primary sources, I show how competing nationalist and internationalist impulses informed the discourse, practice, and aesthetic concerns of photographic art in China. In doing so, this study considers how photography formed concepts of national identity in an era of intense national rivalries. It emphasizes the heated politics behind softly-focused photographs of seemingly apolitical subjects, revealing how making an art of photography became essential to the profile of a modern China.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Photography, Republican China, Fine art,",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
305548939,"Lee, Pauline Chen",Li Zhi (1527–1602): A Confucian feminist of late-Ming China,Modern,"The dissertation describes and analyzes the thought of a Chinese literatus, Li Zhi (1527–1602), who I argue is one of the earliest Confucians to offer substantive arguments for equality between the genders. Li insists that opportunities for self cultivation, a project central to Confucianism and one that was traditionally open only to men, must also be made available to women. His particular vision of self cultivation involves reading classical texts, writing poetry, engaging in discourse and debate, and meditating for the purpose of enhancing one's innate moral, intellectual, and spiritual sensibilities. Not only is Li historically interesting, but his ideas are also philosophically important. I show how an understanding of Li's arguments for gender equality enables us to productively problematize concepts, such as the distinction between private and public and between thinking and feeling, that are common to contemporary western feminist theory. Li's ideas differ in both subtle and overt ways from those of western thinkers discussed in this dissertation, namely John McDowell, John Stuart Mill, Catherine MacKinnon, and Mary Daly. Despite Li's considerable role within Chinese Confucianism, at present there exist but a handful of articles on him in the English language. While the primary aim of the dissertation is to reveal ways in which Confucian feminism as found in Li comes into fruitful dialogue with contemporary western feminisms, the dissertation also sets this feminism in context by providing a description and analysis of Li's influential views on the mind, morality, and government.

The four centuries of the Han Dynasty saw HuangLao evolve from a regional tradition based in the state of Qi into a wide-ranging and influential set of texts and practices which was drawn on by writers of apocryphal texts, experts in longevity techniques, and mass religious movements. The apex of HuangLao was the reigns of Emperors Wen and Jing of the Han (180-141 B.C.E.), a period during which most of the defining personalities of HuangLao flourished. By first examining the traditions surrounding the figures of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and then the texts associated with these figures, the history of HuangLao during its most influential period is outlined. The tradition of the Yellow Emperor appears to be an amalgam of two separate regional traditions, a western member of a set of Five Emperors and an eastern supreme august emperor. Associated with the figure of the Yellow Emperor during the Han were narratives of military conquest, creation of cultural institutions, and supernatural ascension. The tradition of Laozi appears to have derived more directly from a text by that name. The reception of both traditions during the Western Han emphasized these figures' use of sets of specialized techniques to attain their goals. In a way similar to HuangLao traditions, HuangLao texts functioned to legitimate and promote a set of techniques based on the correlation between natural patterns (in Heaven and on Earth) and human affairs. Representative Yellow Emperor texts are examined, including examples in the areas of military science, astronomy, physiognomy, dream interpretation, medicine, and the Sixteen Classics (Shliujing) discovered at Mawangdui in 1973. These texts are shown to generally employ similar sets of correlations to explain the efficacy of their techniques. As such HuangLao should not be defined as a school of thought, but rather a tradition that developed in conjunction with a set of technical disciplines which gained currency during the second and third centuries B.C.E.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Religious history, Asian literature, History, China, Han Dynasty, Laozi",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
305127614,"Morrison, Elizabeth Anne","Ancestors, authority, and history: Chan lineage in the writings of Qisong (1007–1072)",Medieval,"This dissertation is a study of religious lineage in Chinese Chan Buddhism, focusing on the writings of the Chan dharma heir Qisong (1007–1072). In Chapter One, I trace the process by which lineage emerged in Chinese Buddhism, showing that it was not a simple and automatic rejection of sastras and then sutras in favor of patriarchs. Rather, the notion of lineage arose in fits and starts as a supplement to or even justification of the transmission of texts and textual knowledge. In Chapter Two, I explore how lineage, while effectively bypassing traditional forms of Indian Buddhist authority, claims transmission from Indian figures. I argue that lineage may be a significant Chinese response to the fundamental Buddhist dilemma of the absence of the Buddha and the decline of the dharma. Chan patriarchs may be seen as the emphatic affirmation of some Chinese Buddhists that the dharma has been preserved and enlightenment is possible. In Chapters Three and Four, I recount Qisong's life and demonstrate that the view of him as either a mild-mannered “Confucian monk” or a history-distorting sectarian zealot is unfounded. From Qisong's own language, it is clear that he regarded all of his activities, including an energetic letter-writing campaign to have his works on Chan history accepted at court, as the promotion and defense of true religion. In Chapter Five, I offer a close reading of Qisong's Chuanfa zhengzong lun , the historiographical essay accompanying his main historical work, the Chuanfa zhengzong ji , attempting to demonstrate the creative, sometimes historically casuistic, approach Qisong took to reconstructing Chan lineage from a wide range of sources. With Qisong, lineage became a direct object of discussion, and in Chapter Six, I present his understanding of lineage as the core of the Buddhist tradition. I also lay out Qisong's vision of Buddhist history in relation to lineage. In the Conclusion, I pursue these historiographical questions and find that Qisong brought Buddhist and Chinese patterns of history together into a grand narrative of perpetual preservation of the dharma transmission in a world wracked by misunderstanding.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Ancestors, Authority, Buddhism, Chan Buddhism, China, Lineage, Qisong",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
304629376,"Chung, Chi-nien","Markets, culture and institutions: The formation and transformation of business groups in Taiwan, 1960s–1990s",Contemporary,"Business groups are a special type of enterprise system existing in almost every market economy. This study tries to explain why business groups emerge in Taiwan in the first place and what induces their structural change in ownership and management from the 1970s to the 1990s. For these issues, I review three theoretical frameworks, market-centered theories of organizational form, the cultural perspective on organizational evolution, and the institutional approach. By using data for Taiwan's largest 100 business groups in 1973, 1986, and 1994, I show the significant effect of regulatory institutions on the formation and evolution of Taiwan's business groups. It is the institutional incentives that induced entrepreneurs to adopt a grouping strategy rather than a hierarchical one. Although market expansion was a necessary condition, markets alone are not sufficient to determine why firms organize in certain ways rather than others. I also show how the privatization process between 1987 and 1993 changed the inter-group ownership structure and created new property forms. This challenges the cultural determinist view and calls for a contingent stance on Chinese familism. My institutional argument is also confirmed by the change of the composition of the top management team before and after the institutional transformation between 1987 and 1993. By comparison with the effects of markets and culture, my study shows the importance of governmental regulations in explaining business organizations. Although the institutional effects are significant, the relationship between institutions and organizations is mutually constructive rather than unidirectional. The last part of this dissertation deciphers the laws of business groups in Taiwan and shows the corporate actions of large business groups in the initiation, legislation, and implementation of corporate laws. The evidence and arguments presented have substantial implications for three lines of current research, economic sociology of firms, institutions and organizations in transitional economies, and business, states, and economic development. For future studies, the outcomes of group structure such as member firm performance and national income distribution are promising directions. Secondly, the interactive relationships between institutions and organizations will be further corroborated by incorporating comparative studies of business groups in different institutional contexts.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Social structure, Management, History, Business groups, China, Culture, Economic development, Institutions, Markets, Taiwan",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States
2600000001,"Elmore, Andrew Geniesse",Gendering Generations: Redefining Masculine Life Stages in Modern China,Contemporary,"My dissertation, drawing on archives and collections in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, is a cultural history of how Chinese masculine life stages changed and coexisted over the course of the tumultuous twentieth century. In four case study-based chapters, I show how new ideas of age- and gender-appropriate behavior for Chinese men at differing life stages in disparate historical moments emerged in tandem. New life stages were created in dialogue with longstanding traditions, international debates, and emerging problems of modernity. Each chapter centers on a life stage that proved key to the formation of a new understanding of masculinity, beginning with boyhood in the early twentieth century and closing with old manhood at the turn of the twenty-first century. This life-cycle structure overlays the historical timeline on the biological timeline and reveals how gender norms interplayed with ideas about age-appropriate behavior. It also illustrates how generationally divided understandings of gender and life stages existed simultaneously. Rather than provide a comprehensive taxonomy of age-specific masculinities, this dissertation emphasizes the life stage as a category of analysis and expands our understanding of masculinity as a multifaceted category in China’s gender history. I argue that boyhood in China underwent a fundamental transformation beginning in the 1910s, when urban Chinese Boy Scout troops promoted a novel conception of child masculinity (Chapter 1). After the millennia-old imperial examination system was abolished in 1905, Scouting provided a new metric for boyhood achievement through its crisis-based approach to masculine education and merit badges rewarding discrete technical skills. Rather than guardians of tradition and students of classical knowledge, Scouting reconceptualized ideal Chinese boys as crisis-ready, innovative, technically vi omnicompetent masters of nature and technology. Later generations of the Kuomintang and the Communist party drew upon these early Chinese Boy Scouts to form their own politicized crisis-ready youth groups. Next, I uncover how photogenic bodies became a status symbol for Chinese male youths from the 1930s to the 1950s (Chapter 2). Prior to this, male status was displayed via clothing rather than the body itself. Using hitherto unstudied Chinese muscle magazines, I reveal how youthful Chinese bodybuilding entrepreneurs urged their peers to harness gymnasiums and photography to achieve the physical appearance of classical Greek statuary. While drawing on an international physical culture movement, these entrepreneurs used physique photography to argue that photogenic bodies were more necessary for youths than competitive athletic abilities. Thousands of youths mailed their unclad photos to magazines and traded them among pen-pals in a technologically mediated, homosocial community. Presaging the washboard abs of present-day matinee idols and underwear models, the Chinese bodybuilding movement made photogenic unclothed bodies a locus of youthful masculine status. The next chapter demonstrate how state policies promoting gender equality redefined the life stage of wedlock in the People’s Republic of China from the 1950s through the 1960s. After the 1950 passage of China’s New Marriage Law, men’s superiority in a hierarchical marriage was no longer enshrined in law. The new law permitted women to file for divorce, inherit and own property, and forbade arranged marriage and concubinage (Chapter 3). Even the gendered semantics of marriage roles changed as the words “husband” and “wife” were supplanted by the gender neutral, once unsavory-sounding, term “lover.”",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Stanford University,NA,NA,"Youth,",37,Stanford,California,37.4252,-122.1674,United States

By using Ni Zan's paintings as counter-memories, my project raises new questions about the dominant mythology surrounding Ni Zan. Mainstream historiographies in China define him as a loyal recluse, which limits understandings of the variety of his life experiences. Instead, my research shows that Ni Zan was an active agent who coped with turbulent times by means of artistic practice, and reconstructs the forgotten local history of the Wu region (today's Suzhou and its surrounding area) in the late Yuan period. My analysis of Ni's paintings shows how art objects can operate as a creative social force and spotlights two previously overlooked potentialities in Chinese painting. First, it can function as, what I term, a """"communal space"""" of memory, communion, or personal/political mourning.

304943735,"Wu, Guo","Media, nationhood, and state: Zheng Guanying and the urban cultural sphere in late Qing Shanghai",Modern,"Zheng Guanying (1842-1922) was an influential late Qing thinker, merchant and entrepreneur. He was the first person to openly advocate the establishment of a parliamentary system in China as early as the 1870s. Compared with other contemporary enlightened thinkers, Zheng Guanying did not even have the elementary degree of Xiucai, and had never gone to the West. The contrast between his academic achievement and intellectual breadth makes his experience in Shanghai as a comprador merchant significant. From the 1860s, he moved to Shanghai from his Cantonese hometown and became an employee in a British company. Influenced by the liberal education in the missionary school and the rise of print media in Shanghai, he engaged in thinking and writing about current affairs and contributed to the widely circulated newspaper Shenbao, founded by an American merchant in 1872, and edited by Chinese literati. The editors and Zheng as well as other literary men with similar experience actually formed a new urban cultural space in Shanghai actively engaged in the propagation of new concepts and reformist ideas. Supra-local social networks based on common political concerns and public sphere such as the Zhangyuan garden further enhanced this new urban space. Zheng's reformist ideas covered the domains from education, press, to nation defense, etc. Among the ideas elaborated by Zheng in his works, his incipient conceptions of nationalism, democracy and strong advocating of mercantilism were particularly outstanding. As a merchant and entrepreneur, Zheng also made contribution to the development of the official sponsored endeavors such as China Merchant Steamship Company and Shanghai Cotton Cloth Mill, but during this process, he realized the huge gap between the goal of the government and that of the merchants, and between the understandings of the particular term public. Zheng's political attitude was moderate and he did not sanction the actions of radical leaders like Kang Youwei, however, he fully accepted the Republican revolution led by Sun Yat-sen, and opposed Yuan Shikai's efforts of imperial restoration.

305472662,"Shemo, Connie Anne","An army of women: The medical ministries of Kang Cheng and Shi Meiyu, 1873–1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the medical ministries of Kang Cheng and Shi Meiyu, two Chinese women Christian medical missionaries who were both born in 1872 and grew up close to the American Methodist missionary community in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province. After graduating from the medical school of the University of Michigan in 1896, both came to run mission hospitals for women and nursing schools in China, Kang in Nanchang until her death in 1931, Shi first in Jiujiang and then in Shanghai until the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Their medical ministries provide a lens through which we can explore the cultural interfaces created by both the American missionary enterprise and American attempts to export Western scientific medicine. The dissertation illuminates the complexity of power relations on these cultural interfaces. It is ultimately a study of the movement of ideas and the creation of institutions across national boundaries, emphasizing the fluidity of these boundaries and focusing on the process of interpretation and adaptation by people in the host culture. It thus serves to integrate U.S. history with a broader global history. The dissertation begins by exploring the childhoods of Kang and Shi, suggesting that, simultaneously participating in but marginalized by both the missionary community and their local Chinese society, they became skilled “cultural interpreters.” I then argue that they used these skills in building their medical ministries, synthesizing ideas from American women's evangelical political culture and the rhetoric of Chinese nationalist reformers to formulate a vision of Chinese Christian women participating in the creation of a strong and healthy nation. The dissertation then analyzes Kang's and Shi's relationship with the China Medical Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, which became a primary force in introducing Western medicine to China in the 1910s. While soliciting funds from the CMB they offered an alternative to the Rockefeller emphasis on elaborately equipped hospitals with their focus on training “nurse-evangelists” to set up dispensaries in rural areas. The final section shows the growing difficulties of Kang's and Shi's position on a cultural interface in the 1920s as the Chinese anti-Christian movement challenged their nationalist credentials, the fundamentalist-modernist controversy threatened support for missions in the United States, and increasing political turmoil weakened their base of support among Chinese reformers.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,State University of New York at Binghamton,NA,NA,"American history, History, Religion, Womens studies, Biographies, China, Kang Cheng, Medical ministries, Methodist, Missionaries, Shi Meiyu",6,Buffalo,New York,42.09009759304814,-75.96933829629776,United States
304944491,"Liang, Samuel Yunxiang","Ephemeral households, splintered city: Mapping leisure in the sojourners' Shanghai, 1870–1900",Contemporary,"This dissertation critiques the assumption that Chinese modernity was merely or mainly an import from the West. Modernity as such often consisted of superficial, progressive images imposed on a social framework that had shown remarkable resilience and historical continuity. This framework, exemplified by the neo-Confucian continuum of various social structures and spaces that unified the public and private spaces, the sacred and secular realms, and the rural and urban areas, was disrupted by the artificial order of modern cosmopolitan culture, which was emerging in late nineteenth-century Shanghai. Based on this theoretical model outlined in the introductory chapter, the next four chapters seek to reinterpret the meanings of modernity by portraying and analyzing an imaginary social landscape in late nineteenth-century Shanghai as it was represented in the contemporary urban literature including periodicals, travel notes, guidebooks and fiction. Chapter 2 first discusses the historical tradition from which this literature was developed and its transformation in the foreign settlements after Western-style publishing mechanisms were introduced. The courtesan house became the sojourners' surrogate home, one which inherited and parodied the communal function of the traditional household lost to the sojourners. In Chapter 3, the dynamics of this home are understood primarily through a reading of Han Bangqing's novel Flowers of Shanghai (1894), and secondarily through nineteenth-century guidebooks and travel notes. The rise of the courtesan house signified a changing notion of home, as both a physical and social space, in metropolitan culture. Chapter 4 discusses the architectural and urban setting of this new home. Chapter 5 continues to explore similar spatial features on a larger scale by examining the dialectics of the artificial and the natural, the foreign and the indigenous, the public and the private as they were played out in the poetic and journalistic representations of the sojourners' experiences in public spaces such as the city's broad avenues, teahouses, shops, theaters and public gardens. In sum, through a critical and intertextual reading of late ninetieth-century periodicals, travel notes, guidebooks, and fiction, this dissertation analyzes the sojourners' experiences in private and public space, diagnoses a modern development that was at once a reinvention of the lost ideals and an adjustment to the new industrial culture, and charts a new configuration of time, space and materiality that constitutes a modernity that stands in contrast to the positivist conception of the modern marked by linear progress.

It is said to be the largest women's organization in the world because it has been declared by the Chinese government as the only legal representative for all Chinese women. However, since its founding both the ACWF and its staff have been marginalized in China. This thesis applies recent theories of power to the field of gender. It also collects first-hand data through direct interviews with its research subjects. Most ideas and concepts previously developed about the ACWF in China positively assess its usefulness to Chinese women. My research has come up with an opposite conclusion. Through a discussion of the ACWF's role in modern China, I conclude that if the existence of the organization is not totally unnecessary, it nevertheless has played a limited role in protecting the best interests of Chinese women. Indeed it has had a negative impact on the lives of Chinese women. First, the ACWF emerged as an auxiliary to the CCP instead of as an independent women's organization. As such, it has helped the CCP work on organizing the whole of China under one party's leadership. Second, due to its lack of financial autonomy, handicapped organizational structure, and lack of rights to independently recruit its own personnel, the ACWF, even in the issue of women's affairs, is manipulated by the male dominated CCP power. Since the CCP has intervened in ACWF affairs from the very beginning, the ACWF's autonomy is limited to what the male dominated party permits.

It examines the intertwining relationship among commerce, natural disaster, and science and technology by focusing on how merchants in China's treaty ports and Hong Kong exerted their influence upon the incipient public weather service. Frequent and powerful typhoons, which threatened the primary business in steam shipping and marine insurance of these merchants, constituted their major concern for establishing a network of meteorological observation and typhoon warnings at the China coast. They mobilized public opinions through the English-language daily newspapers circulated among ports to incorporate various observers, including an observatory established by French Jesuits at Shanghai, shipmasters of mercantile marine, the foreign staff of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs, and a British governmental observatory in Hong Kong. Their purpose was to secure among coastal ports the transmission and distribution of telegraphic typhoon messages, especially those from another Jesuit observatory in Manila. for typhoons usually came from the seas close to the Philippines. Typhoon warnings thus became the major task of the early China-coast meteorology. With such main lines, this dissertation highlights three closely related aspects of the development of meteorology in nineteenth-century China. First, it exemplifies the active participation of the inter-port mercantile community in the scientific enterprise. Second, it identifies multilateral scientific, imperial, and commercial agencies from a wide spectrum that were involved in the coordination and competition of the meteorological work.

Using Bourdieu's key concepts of """"""""field,"""""""" """"""""habitus"""""""" and """"""""capital,"""""""" this dissertation investigates three marker Chinese Bible versions translated between 1807 and 1919 and finds that, in a competitive field of cultural production, as in the case of the missionary-dominated Chinese Bible translation, political considerations usually gave precedence to linguistic elements. That includes the initiation, translation, and distribution of a particular version of the Chinese Bible. Moreover, as translation is a bilingual and bicultural activity, the general absence of Chinese scholars as coworkers in the historical narrative associated with the cultural production, presents a curious phenomenon that warrants scrutiny, especially considering the high quality of some Bible versions produced during this time, e.g., the Delegates' Version (1854) and the Mandarin Chinese Union Version (1919).

Through the history of hydroelectricity, it examines how Chinese elites responded to the global trend of the rise of """"white coal"""" after World War I, how the Chinese Nationalists and Japanese tried to apply this technology to energize national resistance and imperial dominance respectively, and how the Chinese Communists relied on it to realize its socialist ambitions during the Great Leap Forward. Social processes in the building of hydroelectric power plants, and, more broadly, in the making of the envirotechnical regime, feature prominently in this study. This research reveals local communities' responses to the changes that hydroelectric technology wrought in their habitat and daily life. Particularly in the case of the Sanmenxia reservoir resettlement, tens of thousands inhabitants were involuntarily displaced to the northwest frontier, extending the social effects of the concrete dam far beyond the river and the reservoir it produced. This narrative employs a range of sources from inside and outside of mainland China. It is a reconstruction of the rise of hydroelectricity in twentieth-century China from an envirotechnical perspective. As such, it seeks not only to perceive Chinese history through the lens of environmental and technological history, but also to provide an alternative to the standard global historical narrative dominated by fossil fuels.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,State University of New York at Buffalo,History,History,"Social sciences, China, Dams, Envirotechnical regime, Hydroelectricity, Social changes, State making,",3,Buffalo,New York,42.9018,-78.8487,United States

Using “worn-out shoes” (a synecdoche for women accused of transgressing sexual norms) as a lens, I demonstrate the significance of the Land Reform campaign in the process of the militarization of women and to explore the situations of women and their sexuality in atrocities and crimes during the revolution. With endorsement from the local cadres and leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), fierce and bloody behavior by women participants in local affairs was valorized by the state for the first time in this Land Reform campaign, which normalized women’s violence in the Communist revolution. Many of these women were described as “worn-out shoes” in the official documents and in their village communities. Some “worn-out shoes” became a strike force using violence, while some were vulnerable targets in the struggle sessions. During the Land Reform, revolutionary dramas and women’s speaking-bitterness became the essential part of the CCP’s propaganda in the course of establishing a new revolutionary gender hierarchy. Rural women with diverse motives actively participated in this campaign with violence, seeking revenge on sexual predators, fighting against domestic violence, beating and killing acquaintances to cover their secrets, and attacking other women of whom they were jealous. More importantly, this period saw the emergence of a new revolutionary morality for women focused on their work ethic and expectations of sexual purity related to their class status.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,State University of New York at Buffalo,History,History,NA,3,Buffalo,New York,42.9018,-78.8487,United States

During this period, American radio interests dramatically increased their activities in East Asia, especially China. To these radiotelegraphic and broadcasting interests, interwar China appeared a potentially lucrative market. Throughout this period, the American government stood ready to give American radio interests vigorous promotion and support. However, not one of these endeavors became the viable enterprise that had been envisioned at its outset. Every effort to expand the American radio presence in China examined in this study sparked intense diplomatic conflict and controversy. American radio interests encountered three main obstacles in interwar China. First, Chinese political instability, growing nationalism, and rising anti-foreignism throughout the 1920s and 1930s compelled some Chinese officials to block American radio initiatives. Second, Japanese expansion in China further muddled the situation American radio interests faced. In one respect, Japanese expansion intensified the political instability, nationalism, and anti-foreignism American radio already confronted in China. The Japanese also opposed the expansion of American radio on the basis that its presence undermined Japanese radio interests in China. Finally, the staunch and effective opposition from Chinese and Japanese quarters that American radio encountered in East Asia underscored a fundamental shortcoming in American strategies. American radio interests and supportive policymakers betrayed a mystifying ignorance to the Japanese and Chinese concerns on which American radio intruded. A central purpose of this dissertation is to explain why, time and time again, the supposedly intelligent men in the radio industry and the American government could be so unaware of the antagonistic and counterproductive actions they repeatedly took on behalf of expanding American radio into China. In the process, this study demonstrates how American radio activities in interwar era China intersected with the same problems and issues that led to the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and the Japanese-American War in 1941.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,State University of New York at Stony Brook,NA,NA,"American history, History, China, East Asia, Foreign relations, Radio",6,Stony Brook,New York,40.9061,-73.1278,United States
304667164,"Tsao, Ting Man","Representing China to the British public in the age of free trade, c. 1833–1844",Contemporary,"This dissertation studies anew nineteenth-century British imperialism in China by focusing on, for the first time, British representations of China and the Chinese that widely circulated along the “Eastern” trade routes during the Opium War period from 1833 to 1844. I examine such popular representations as integral parts of Britain's changing imperial policy in “Eastern Asia.” In my study, I analyze how various publications about China gave form to the British empire's constantly evolving trade practices, missionary activities, national and parliamentary concerns, diplomatic crises, colonial policies, and military actions in this formative period of “free trade” with the “celestial empire.” As such, the plethora of printed matters about Chinese affairs were not simply transparent records of “facts” for historical reconstruction or “reactions” of the British public to the government's China policy as historians have traditionally assumed. Rather, they were statements of the nation's imperial projects that could, through their specific styles, appeal to an empire-wide public and muster their support, both economic and political. Additionally, they are statements of imperialism that last and still influence both our present efforts in critiquing Orientalism and our historiography of the Opium War and the “opening” of China. There were two crucial lines of changes in British representations of China on which the dissertation focuses. The first line was the increasing politicization and publicity of the China question through print and other media after the East India Company's monopoly in the British China trade was abolished in 1834. This empire-wide publicity project was instrumental in transforming the China question from the Company's affairs into a matter of “public” concern and in bolstering the new agenda of extending “free” and “individual” enterprises to China. The second line of representational changes was the rise and fall of different genres that served to support different approaches to dealing with China or different national agendas in response to the political exigencies of the time such as the opium question. Such genres included the embassy narrative, the “individualistic” travel narrative, the objective pamphlet, the military narrative, and the multimedia exhibition of the “Chinese World in Miniature.”",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,State University of New York at Stony Brook,NA,NA,"British and Irish literature, European history, History, British, China, Free trade, Imperialism, Opium War, Public",6,Stony Brook,New York,40.9061,-73.1278,United States

Integrating women and gender into the exploration of the war and society of 1937-45, this dissertation reveals that women's social relief activities were as much about the emergence of the patriotic female subject of modern women as they were about the wartime deliberations on resistance and the making of the nation. Women portrayed themselves as national citizens who shared half the responsibility for national reconstruction, and took civic pride in their patriotic deeds. During the war, Chinese women gained greater mobility and visibility in public arenas, and cultivated a profound sense of politicization in their relief work in the areas of nursing, war orphan relief, front line service and propaganda work. Their public activities brought them into leadership positions, which often demanded independent and strategic performances in order to survive the deprivations of war. At the same time, women's activities became the embodiment of their commitment to the collective goals of the nation, which was a drastic change from their May Fourth sisters' championing of individual subjectivities and romantic love. Women were often placed in a secondary position and their work was supplementary in nature to the battle work of the soldiers, which was deemed as an ultimate masculine field that excluded women.

However, there was no unanimity in attitudes and actions of Chinese social groups in the conflict. Although all these major groups took saving China from foreign aggression as their “righteous mission” and used the traditional Chinese concept of patriotism—“righteousness” ( yi )—to legitimize their action in the movement, they interpreted “righteousness” differently to fit their own interests. These different interpretations prominently embodied in the slogans of these social groups. An analysis of the underlying meanings of their political slogans contributes to the exploration of their cultural assumptions and moral frameworks of their political actions. Although previous studies have suggested that Boxer actions were grounded in a sense of moral rectitude, the same interpretation has not been applied to the other main social actors. My research examines the moral framework of these formerly excluded social groups. My dissertation will examine the slogans of each of the five main social groups, the Boxers, the Qing court, the provincial officials, the reformers, and the local gentry, in the Boxer movement and explore the influence of these cultural interpretations of “righteousness” on their political actions. I argue that the traditional concept of “righteousness” ( yi ) played an important role in the movement. however, its meaning and function were a construction of the power relations between these social groups.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,State University of New York at Stony Brook,History,History,"History, Boxer movement, China, Modern China new cultural history, Righteousness, Slogans",6,Stony Brook,New York,40.9061,-73.1278,United States
304475195,"Zaccarini, Maria Cristina","The Sino-American friendship as tradition and challenge: Dr. Ailie Gale in China, 1908-1950",Contemporary,"Twentieth century Americans' sentimental feelings of attachment toward China were largely linked to missionaries, the majority of whom were women. Some of these female missionaries were part of a presumed sisterhood, sharing ideals that often enabled them to achieve what this study terms empowerment-through-piety. Emphasizing female and male spiritual equality and the traditional female duty of service to God, these ideals allowed some of the women to challenge traditional notions of patriarchal order. Scholars have shown how nineteenth century women missionaries were a conservative force, fostering the exalted image of American women in comparison to their heathen counterparts. This study examines the forces for challenge that coexisted alongside this conservatism. Empowerment-through-piety allowed nineteenth century women to form and support missionary societies and serve as doctors in the foreign mission field while challenging male authority by raising funds, speaking in public and pursuing an education equal to that of Victorian men. This study traces the legacy of empowerment by examining the correspondence of twentieth century missionary to China, Dr. Ailie Gale, who typified these ideals. As a Methodist, Gale belonged to the largest Protestant denomination in America. A physician and administrator of hospitals in China, Gale's discursive self-representation suggested to supporters that their friendship with China was based upon values which were traditional to Protestant, and especially Methodist, women, and challenges to both American perceptions of the place of women in medicine and in society, and notions of China and the global realm. This study relies upon approximately 2,000 letters written by Gale to supporters and family, and contributed for this study by her son Frank Gale, personal interviews, and manuscript collections in the following archives: Drew University, New Jersey, the Board of Global Ministries, New York City, Rockefellar Center Archives in New York, and the Yale Divinity School's China Records Project.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,State University of New York at Stony Brook,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, History, American history, Biographies, China, Gale, Ailie, Missionaries, Sino-American friendship, Tradition",6,Stony Brook,New York,40.9061,-73.1278,United States
304950227,"Xu, Tong",The evolving stage: Theater and socio -cultural transformation in early modern China,Pre-modern,"This dissertation examines the social and cultural significance of theater in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century China. Focusing on the relation between theater and different social groups, especially the literati, the author demonstrates that the changing ways in which theater was consumed embodied profound social and cultural transformation in these two centuries, namely, a burgeoning consumer culture was in the process of formation, which in turn led to the blurring of social lines and the diffusion of power in the field of cultural production. The first part of the dissertation considers the rise of a new dramatic form kunqu and the prevalence of household acting troupes from late sixteenth-century to mid seventeenth-century. In the process in which late Ming literati transformed the folk theatrical form kunshang qiang into the refined kunqu , they set an important aesthetic standard for this new form, namely, refined but not profound, plain but not uncouth. In this way kunqu was able to court a gradually diverse urban elite, including literati, merchants, and other previously unprivileged social groups. In the proto-consumer society of seventeenth-century China, kunqu became a means for this new elite group to demonstrate their distinction, which was vividly demonstrated by the fashion of keeping a household acting troupe for those with ready cash and alleged taste. The second part considers the emergence of a mass leisure industry in the eighteenth-century. The first group of public playhouses known as xiyuan appeared in mid eighteenth-century Beijing. Xiyuan provided theatrical performances to most of the urban residents on a daily basis. More importantly, it created a more open social space. The emergence of public playhouses and the consequent professional resident troupes indicates that a profit-driven mass leisure industry was on its way. The author concludes that the theater's shift from elite salon to public playhouses indicates its change from an object of luxury consumption to one of mass consumption.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,State University of New York at Stony Brook,NA,NA,"History, Theater, China, Household acting troupe, Sociocultural transformation, Theater",6,Stony Brook,New York,40.9061,-73.1278,United States
304564938,"Lin, Wei-zen",The transformation of Hainan's historical geography: From 110 BCE to 1949,Contemporary,"This dissertation investigates Hainan's historical geography from 110 BCE to 1949. Unlike previous research in which the island of Hainan is the sole focus and discussed in terms of China's sovereignty, this study expands the research scope in three aspects. Geographically, it covers not only the Island of Hainan, but also the islands in the South China Sea, namely, the Paracel Islands, the Sprady Islands, Pratas Island, and Macclesfield Bank. Analytically, Hainan's transformations are examined not only in China's socio-political-economic contexts but also within the wider, global changing political economy. Methodologically, though chiefly concerned with historical transformations, fieldwork is conducted so as to obtain a sense of place to complement the limitations associated with the study of historical literature and sources. Drawing on the formulation of dynamic geography by a 17th-century Chinese historical geographer, Gu Zuyu, and contemporary Western process-oriented perspectives, this dissertation conceptualizes Hainan not as a physically fixed sphere, but as a place that is politically constructed, strategically maneuvered and historically contingent. To portray Hainan's developments by emphasizing the geographical vision, rather than relying on a chronological framework, I use spatial concepts in this dissertation to illustrate Hainan's transformations. that is, Hainan as “points,” a “line,” an “area,” and a “maritime space.” Furthermore, to show the dynamism of Hainan's historical geography, I investigate Hainan from five different perspectives, which are those of imperial officials, literati, Han civilians (primarily merchants, peasants, and fishermen), Li minority, and the foreign powers. The portrayal of Hainan's transformations in terms of spatial concepts and these multiple perspectives present a complex picture of why Hainan has been transformed, how, and to what extent. As suggested in this dissertation, when evaluating Hainan as a place in relation to Mainland China and from the perspective of global political economy, its transformation may be positive than negative overall, and yet, as far as the people (including the Li and the Hainanese) are concerned, the outcome is more debatable as to its benefits. This comprehensive study of Hainan's historical geography will serve as a basis for understanding not only Hainan's past but also its future.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Syracuse University,NA,NA,"Geography, History, China, Hainan, Historical geography",6,Syracuse,New York,43.0407,-76.1437,United States
304131033,"Tang, Xiaofeng",From dynastic geography to historical geography,Contemporary,"This study is concerned with the development of the study of historical geography in China in the twentieth century. By this development, the traditional dynastic geography was gradually succeeded by a modern historical geography. The dynastic geography, a traditional scholarship cultivated in Confucianism, had been particularly concerned with the geo-political structures of the imperial dynasties. In Confucian description, the geographical order of the imperial world was centralized, hierarchical and harmonious, and every part of the world should be civilized, united, and evenly developed. For Confucian scholars, study of dynastic geography was intended to serve two purposes: to defend the highly idealistic harmony designed by great sages in the Golden Age on the one hand, and to discuss the actual arrangements and changes of the dynastic geographies controlled by kingly power on the other. Their approach to geography was historical, and their methodology was textual examination. Criticism of the traditional dynastic geography within the context of the discourse of social and ideological movements promoted the modern development of historical geography. Two phases could be distinguished: the early phase, which was roughly the period between the two World-Wars, and the later phase, the 1950s-1960s. In the first phase, a new dynastic geography was developed, which was based on strong criticisms of the Confucian world view and traditional historiography, and aimed at the construction of new geo-political structures of the dynasties. The second phase was characterized by successful employment of modern geographical theory and the direct influence of Western historical geography. The study of historical geography in China finally broke through the framework of dynastic history. Historical geography as a knowledge never has a sui generis quality. rather, it is shaped and justified by the discourse of the dominant theoretical thinking. Both the ideas and the structure of the subject have developed in response to complex social, economic, ideological and intellectual stimuli. Thus this study of the development of the discipline is more than simply the chronological listing of the achievements of a few great scholars, but rather a contextual examination.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,Syracuse University,NA,NA,"Geography, History, Science history, China, geography",6,Syracuse,New York,43.0407,-76.1437,United States
2278078935,"Liu, Jing","Beyond the Land: Maritime Interactions, Border Control, and Regional Powers between China and Korea, 1500-1637",Modern,"This dissertation interweaves the maritime dynamics of Ming China and Chosŏn Korea’s northern sea space, the Bohai Sea and the northern Yellow Sea, with the Northeast Asian transition of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. This region formed an arena in this time period that allowed various players to communicate, negotiate, and contest. It also established a linkage between Northeast Asian terra-centered states and maritime East Asia. A systematic investigation of this particular region is thus essential to improving our understanding of interactive territorial and maritime relations. This dissertation investigates the increase of maritime commerce, wartime logistics, and military intervention in the Bohai Sea and the northern Yellow Sea. In this context, it also focuses on the relations between China-Korea maritime interactions and the two states’ border control practices. It further analyzes the interplay between the maritime expansion of Chinese regional military powers, and the Ming and Chosŏn authorities. This study argues that the China-Korea northern space experienced a remarkable maritime orientation and witnessed the development of regional maritime powers. This transition and its interconnection with state control of maritime peripheries played important roles in influencing the Northeast Asian history of this period. The prosperous maritime economy and the successive military operations in China and Korea beginning in the sixteenth century encouraged transmarine mobility and regional integration of their northern littoral across state boundaries. This tendency increased government attention to this area and strengthened state involvement in cross-border affairs. Maritime policies between the Ming and the Chosŏn showed much plasticity and permeability, which benefited their transregional and large-scale deployment of resources, secured their northern coasts, and expanded state influence to the sea. However, these practices also generated tensions with the two authorities’ attempts to distinguish their maritime frontiers and control their coastal people. This problem not only existed within China and Korea but it also greatly influenced their relations. Porous and adjustable coastal control in the circumstances of the quickening maritime integration of China and Korea enabled Ming regional military men to grow their individual power across the sea. The establishment of Mao Wenlong’s military regime in the early seventeenth century represents this tendency. While Mao’s utilization and mobilization of coastal resources furthered his flexibility and semi-autonomy in a changing international environment, this trend also intensified his conflicts with neighboring continental powers and caused his followers to shift their stances between the Ming and the Qing.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Syracuse University,History,History,"History, Asian History, Asian Studies, Regional powers, Korea, China, Maritime interactions, Border control",6,Syracuse,New York,43.0407,-76.1437,United States
762505226,"Yi, Qiufang",The dragon's veins: Public fengshui in late imperial Wuyuan County,Modern,"Previous studies of fengshui , the long-lived Chinese tradition for connecting luck and the natural environment, have mainly focused on its divinatory aspect, that is, its use in the selection of auspicious sites for graves and homes. The historical role that fengshui had played in public life as a form of shared knowledge of the natural environment or of larger spaces has been largely ignored. As a result, the complexity of this cultural phenomenon and the ways in which it was enmeshed in late imperial culture and society has been underestimated. In this dissertation Chinese people's changing relationship to the environment during late imperial period has been examined by studying the changing power of fengshui discourse in the local history of Wuyuan, one of the six counties of Huizhou, a prefecture which made vast contributions to the development of Chinese culture and economy and was famous for deeply entrenched beliefs in fengshui. Combining socio-economic, intellectual and environmental history approaches, this dissertation explores three interconnected themes: the intellectual links between fengshui ideas and Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism, the important role local elites played in controlling fengshui discourse and dealing with local environmental issues, and fengshui 's connection to the development of local culture and political economy. A key analytical concept advanced in the dissertation is that of public fengshui , which demanded a shared knowledge of the local environment and fengshui resources, and called for more collective and altruistic efforts on the part of local residents for environmental preservation or projects. The dissertation demonstrates that while the basic principles of public fengshui were agreed upon, their application could be highly contested. These features of public fengshui are evidenced through the detailed study of two major conflicts: First, a long-running dispute between limestone quarrymen and local elites, centered in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, over the destruction of Wuyuan's dragon veins. second, an eighteenth-century clash between competing groups of elites over whether a dam should be rebuilt to correct local fengshui. These cases suggest the important role played by public fengshui or environmental issues in the development of civil society in late imperial China.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Syracuse University,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, Public policy, China, Environmental crisis, Huizhou, Local elites, Public fengshui, Wuyuan County",6,Syracuse,New York,43.0407,-76.1437,United States
304773786,"Murphree, Hyon Joo Yoo",Toward an “accented” critique of culture: Theorizing postcolonial East Asia,Contemporary,"In this dissertation, I investigate how the construction of national subjectivity in East Asia is a process that unfolds in a colonial and postcolonial transnational sphere, and I articulate that sphere as what I call the third space of cultural critique. In order to produce that space I imagine a critical event in which the existing system of meaning and the mode of inquiry arrive at the point of aporia. Historical, ideological, and cultural effects of an East Asian context produce an aporetic moment in institutional postcolonial studies as their radical extraneous difference destabilizes conceptual boundaries and analytical methods. I find manifestations of those effects in specific local theaters—primarily South Korea as well as Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong—particularly in the way national cinemas mediate them. Tracing the formation of subjectivity mediated by the visuality of national cinema provides an opportunity to examine and question the applicability, transferability and transformability of existing critical paradigms of postcolonial studies in an East Asian context. It also enables the production of what I call the “extraneous difference” of the East Asian local paradigm and my own “accented” critique of postcolonial culture, emerging through my analysis of Korean cinema informed by local social histories. In order to foreground the extraneous difference, I formulate newly revised notions of subjectivity, nation, and the body, especially in what I define as “moribund masculinity.” It is the kind of male subjectivity that refuses to fulfill the political, economic and ideological demand that is made by the nation-state and global capitalism. This masculine subjectivity subverts the notion of subjectivity that functions as the locus of consciousness involved in the production of identity. As such, it subverts the position of the Other in postcolonial theories, an identity that solidifies the subaltern body. The paradigm of the “accented” critique that I articulate is comparative and deconstructive in that I examine how local particularities place pressure on existing critical paradigms, and yet enable the production of a regional paradigm that changes the scope, as well as the language itself, of those paradigms.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Syracuse University,NA,NA,"History, Gender, Motion pictures, China, Culture, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Masculinity, Postcolonial, Subjectivity, Taiwan",6,Syracuse,New York,43.0407,-76.1437,United States
1807962239,"Lu, Lex Jing","Appearance politics, physiognomy, and leadership image: Building political legitimacy in late imperial and modern China",Contemporary,"Exploring the role that physical appearance played in Chinese political culture, this dissertation focuses on leaders’ roles in crafting an appealing and powerful appearance. I argue that Chinese political figures consistently used a strategy I term “appearance politics” to manipulate the construction of their physical appearance in textual, visual, and/or material media, and manage the interpretation of those physical constructions. In so doing, they were able to claim authority, consolidate power, and pursue legitimacy. I find evidence for the use of appearance politics in Chinese physiognomic depictions, imperial portraiture, official resume dossiers, photography, bronze statues, propaganda posters, and leadership images. The variety of these depictions suggest the long span of my study, which stretches from the mid eighteenth to mid twentieth century. By studying the longue durée of appearance politics, I suggest the many important ways in which physical appearance of male leaders mattered in the Chinese past. The dissertation focuses on four important moments in Chinese history when different cultures came into contact. In these moments, technology and the standards of male beauty changed, but political figures continued to rely on the instruments of appearance politics to empower themselves. In chapters analyzing the secret resume dossier system of the Yongzheng reign, Republican military uniform photographs, Sun Yat-sen bronze statues, and Chinese Communist Party leadership images, I argue that Chinese masculinity and male beauty standards are hybrid constructs, mixing or combining ideal physical features from different political cultures. Chinese male elites used the instruments of appearance politics—and continue to do so—to model themselves on the ideal appearance standards of the time to build legitimacy.",2016,2016,Ph.D.,United States,Syracuse University,History,History,"History, Political science, China, Imperial portraiture, Leadership images, Political culture, Statues",6,Syracuse,New York,43.0407,-76.1437,United States
304637950,"Ashbaugh, William Bernard","The yardstick of trade: The Far Eastern Division and American -East Asian relations, 1933–1935",Contemporary,"Historians have argued that the United States was timid in its relations with Japan during the first Franklin Roosevelt administration because of security concerns. This dissertation shows that although officials feared war until at least June 1933, American policy subsequently was determined more by trade than by security concerns. The State Department measured its policy choices toward China and Japan by what Assistant Chief of the Far Eastern Division Maxwell Hamilton called “the yardstick of trade.” He coined this phrase after touring East Asia during 1933–1934. This important trip and the resulting reports he wrote on conditions in Asia have been heretofore neglected by historians. American-East Asian relations lay under the guiding hand of the Far Eastern Division and its chief, Stanley Hornbeck, and were dictated by commercial concerns considered vital during the Great Depression. Keeping relations balanced between Japan and China was the primary goal of the State Department. A more aggressive condemnation of Japanese actions might have boosted exports to China, but only at the expense of trade with Japan, which was twice as valuable. Recognizing Japan's puppet state of Manchukuo, however, contravened former Secretary of State Henry Stimson's non-recognition doctrine. Recognizing Manchukuo could also have led to trouble with investments in or exports to China, where over ten thousand businessmen and missionaries plied their respective vocations. Any hint that U.S. diplomats would condone the abrogation of international obligations—such as the Kellogg-Briand and Nine-Power Treaties—might have led China to renew its calls for the end to the unequal treaty system. It also might have led to violent anti-American agitation, a threat to both current, and more importantly, potential increased trade with China's teeming millions in the future. The Far Eastern Division quietly pursued the continuation of the non-recognition doctrine and opposition to Japan's aggression. America's even-handed strategy did not satisfy either Asian state. Yet the United States avoided alienating their peoples and governments, thereby protecting current and expanding future commerce with Japan and China—its number three and eight trading partners, respectively, absorbing thirteen percent of American exports.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Temple University,NA,NA,"American history, History, International law, International relations, China, Far Eastern Division, Hamilton, Maxwell, Hornbeck, Stanley, Japan, Maxwell Hamilton, Stanley Hornbeck, United States-East Asia",1,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
2670000000,"Yokell, Matthew Allison","The Eagle and the Dragon: Tsingtau and the German Colonial Experience in China, 1880-1918",Contemporary,"When Germany forced China to surrender part of the province of Shantung and the village of Tsingtau in 1897, it secured the long standing wishes of a German China lobby that had articulated visions of empire that would achieve their individual objectives. While their various ideas were broad and not well defined, at their heart was that Germany should embrace a liberal, commercial model of empire: a “German Hong Kong” that would be a paradigm of colonial rule and a major power center in Asia. There exists a critical need to place Germany’s colonial experience in China in its proper historical context and appreciate its role in German imperialism and the development of a more globalized world at the turn of the twentieth century. This study critically analyzes the colony of Tsingtau in order to elucidate German ideas about empire during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The 3500 Germans in Tsingtau and their supporters created a nexus of associations to build a commercial center to rival British Hong Kong. Inspired by new historical trends, this work examines mid-level state and military officials, diplomats, businessmen, and religious leaders, the “middle management of empire,” that helped develop Tsingtau. In doing so, it studies the colonial experience as “history from the middle,” highlighting the critical role Tsingtau played in Germany’s emergence as a world power. To tell the story of Tsingtau, my research utilizes sources from German, Chinese, and American archives, ascertaining how leaders in Germany and Tsingtau viewed the colony, as well as the impact of colonists’ experiences on German policy.

These mid-level individuals devised and implemented projects to enhance life for the colonists and, sometimes, natives. Their records show how economic, political, and cultural interests worked together to develop the colony and enhance Germany’s status as a world leader.

There is no indication, however, that these early events had any lasting influence on Chinese culture. With England's defeat of China in the Opium War of 1840, and the consequent signing of the Treaty of Nanking (1842), Shanghai, along with five other Chinese coastal cities, was opened for foreign trade and residence. Because of its location at the edge of China's richest and most advanced economic region Shanghai grew very rapidly, attracting large numbers of westerners, and in a relatively short time was transformed from a small village to a cosmopolis nick-named the Paris of the East. The westerners who settled there were mainly missionaries, diplomats, or businessmen who often formed small circles and presented concerts and theatrical performances for their own amusement. These isolated communities of colonists hungered for professional cultural entertainment, and soon opera impresarios from Europe, recognizing the potential for a new enterprise here, began taking the newest and most popular operas to the Far East, often making lengthy tours, performing along the way in Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore, Hong Kong and Batavia before ending in Shanghai. Thus Western opera was again brought to China, and this time it began to have a lasting influence. From about 1875 until 1929 Shanghai was regularly visited by foreign traveling opera companies. This dissertation examines in detail the activity of the traveling western opera troupes in Shanghai, and evaluates their eventual impact upon Chinese culture. The first six chapters deals with the touring companies themselves. their repertoire, the impresarios, the roster of singers, the theaters where they performed and, where possible, the quality of their performance.

The history of art education in elementary and middle schools of the People's Republic of China between 1949 and 1989 is systematically applied. The development of art education is divided into three periods: October 1949–April 1966 when art education mainly adopted the model of the Soviet Union. May 1966–November 1978 when art education fully implemented the educational model of the Red Base Areas. and December 1978–November 1989 when art education started to deal with the Western art education, especially that of the United States. The issues that are critical for an enhanced understanding of the history of art education in the PRC are intensively discussed. Art education before 1949 and after 1989 is also briefly surveyed since doing so clarifies the development of art education in the PRC between 1949 and 1989. Predictive comments on the future of art education in the PRC are put forward. In order to show how art education is carried out in the PRC, the components and functions of the art education system are detailed at both the central-government and grassroots levels.

One of the most important centers of Buddhist sculpture in Sichuan is the area of Dazu county where there are dozens of cliff sculpture sites. This dissertation focuses on the sculpture of Beishan (North Hill), which is one of the two primary sites with Buddhist sculpture in Dazu and the site with the longest chronology in the local area. The principal location for cliff sculpture at Beishan is an approximately quarter mile long sandstone cliff near the summit of Beishan, which is known as the Fowan (Buddha Cove). The cliff sculpture at this site consists of some two-hundred seventy odd image niches and small excavated caves that were carved over a period of roughly two-hundred sixty years from the late ninth to mid twelfth centuries. In this dissertation an attempt is made to provide an iconographical analysis of the Buddhist imagery found at the Fowan site and to show their significance within the developments in Chinese Buddhist art and the Buddhist art of the region, as well as to reveal something of the local society and Buddhist practices that underpinned the sponsorship of this imagery. The most significant iconographic subject matter that occurs at the Fowan site is discussed under the broad categories of Esoteric and Pure Land Buddhism. These include many conventionalized Buddhist iconographies from the Tang and Song Dynasties, but also feature a number of unique iconographic variations. Accordingly, the iconography of the imagery at the site is presented in light of scriptural sources, historical documents, and related imagery elsewhere, particularly within the region. The general history and chronology of the site is discussed in relation to the historical setting of the Sichuan Basin and its broader cultural environment.

304630449,"Shen, Kuiyi",Wu Changshi and the Shanghai art world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,Contemporary,"This dissertation, which focuses on the late Qing and early twentieth century Chinese artist Wu Changshi (1844–1927), argues that fundamental changes took place in the economics of the Chinese art world at the end of the nineteenth century that led to basic shifts in the attitudes of artists and patrons to each other and to art itself. The remarkable career of Wu Changshi, China's most famous painter at the time of his death in 1927, makes possible a case study of the transformation of China's cultural world between about 1895 to 1905 and of the contradictions inherent in the life of a modern traditionalist artist. Born and educated into the Confucian literati class, Wu spent the first fifty-five years of his life seeking to become a scholar-official. Ironically, he failed at this traditional career path, and by 1900 found himself at the center of a burgeoning urban art world, where he became a great success in the highly commodified Shanghai cultural scene. The four chapters of this dissertation discuss the economic, cultural, and social background of Shanghai in the period. patronage of art in Shanghai, including the growth of art shops and art societies. Wu Changshi's biography, social network, and painting, with reference to his unpublished correspondence. and his modern legacy. Despite selling in an increasingly anonymous market, where buyers might include foreigners and uneducated merchants, Wu remained faithful, in many respects, to his scholarly ideals. Most significantly, he succeeded in bringing the aesthetics of ancient epigraphy ( jinshixue ) into his painting, calligraphy, and seal carving. His fundamentalist reform of Chinese painting imbued it with an archaeological flavor believed to embody the most authentic qualities of China's ancient culture and aimed to rescue Chinese art from its late Qing dynasty decline. Ultimately, Wu's art came to represent for sympathetic critics the strength needed to prevail in the modern world against the invasion of Western culture. He was successful in his own work, but his achievements ultimately failed to survive his own lifetime. Despite many competing claims to this title, we consider Wu Changshi to be China's last great literati painter.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,The Ohio State University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, China, Painting, Patronage, Shanghai, Wu Changshi",14,Columbus,Ohio,39.9862,-82.9855,United States
304515483,"Yu, Hongyuan","Shuihu zhuan (water margin) as elite cultural discourse: Reading, writing and the making of meaning",Modern,"This study seeks to evaluate the cultural significance involved in the writing and reading of traditional Chinese fiction ( xiaoshuo ), with the sixteenth-century work Shuihu zhuan (The Water Margin) as a paradigmatic text. The focus is on how meaning is produced through the complex interactions between the text and its ever changing contexts. I first survey the theorizing of fiction by literati critics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with focus on the strategies they used to not only promote fiction, but also enhance their own status as elites by manipulating the cultural roles associated with the writing and reading of fiction. By designating fiction as a popular discourse, the literati accorded the genre with a special license to be unorthodox and subversive, which legitimized their use of it to voice their own discontent. The main part of the study is devoted to an examination of the issues of kingship, loyalty and rebellion as delineated in the Shuihu zhuan , and as discussed in the commentaries written by literati commentators. Through the writing of commentaries, the commentators produce a meta-discourse in which they discuss important cultural and ideological issues. My study also investigates the new significance imposed upon the Shuihu zhuan in the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and examine several historical moments at which the novel was re-evaluated and re-interpretated against the background of new ideologies and political agendas in the cultural and literary transformations in China's modernization.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,The Ohio State University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Comparative literature, History, China, Cultural, Discourse, Elite, Meaning, Reading, Shuihu zhuan, Water Margin, Writing",14,Columbus,Ohio,39.9862,-82.9855,United States
304230331,"Chen, Chun-chi",Politics and the novel: A study of Liang Ch'i-ch'ao's The Future of New China and his views on fiction,Contemporary,"This dissertation attempts to delineate the relationship between politics and the novel in the late-Ch'ing period through Liang Ch'i-ch'ao's (1873-1929) views on fiction and his novel, The Future of New China. Liang's advocating the new fiction, the political fiction, and his founding of New Fiction, China's first fiction magazine, along with his championing fiction as the supreme literary form, have created an overwhelming blooming of fiction writing and criticism. We cannot attribute all the accomplishments of fiction in this period to Liang alone, but his role in opening up a variety of possibilities for modern Chinese fiction to develop is pivotal. In this dissertation, I first elaborate on the methodology and perspective adopted. Then, Liang's general literary thought is highlighted, with a view to seeing where Liang stands in Chinese literary tradition. In the next chapter, I trace the development of Liang's views on fiction from 1896 to 1915, with the emphasis on several of Liang's key concepts such as revolution in fiction, the political novel, realistic and idealistic fiction, and four powers of fiction--the powers of fiction to perfume (hsun X), to soak (chin X), to stimulate (tz'u X) and to elevate (t'i X). The overall purpose is to see how Liang's views of fiction sum up traditional moralism in fiction and blend it with the current socio-political concern to open up a new trend that critics come to term the moral burden of modern Chinese fiction. Liang Ch'i-ch'ao's novel, The Future of New China, is where he put his views on fiction into practice. This novel might have been inspired by Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward, 2000-1887 and other Japanese political novels prevalent at the time when Liang was in exile in Japan. Examining it carefully, however, we will have to acknowledge that besides the possible influences, Liang is by and large writing within the Chinese narrative tradition, yet incorporating political discourse and concerns into this tradition. His novel can therefore be called an idealistic political novel. This fact confirms our contention that Liang as a transitional figure, on the one hand, strove for a new medium to carry the consciousness of a new age but, on the other hand, could not easily get away from the grip of the tradition in which he was deeply rooted. In the next chapter, Ideology and Genre, Liang's views on fiction are seen along with critical discourse of other conscientious intellectuals to suggest that late-Ch'ing intellectuals can be described as participating in a social mission to use the literary imagination and medium as an instrument to change society. In the final analysis, as a transitional intellectual figure, Liang Ch'i-ch'ao not only is in control of the public opinion but also exerts an influence on the development of literature. His revolution in prose, poetry, and fiction, if not precisely revolutionary as we see them today, did, however, bring late-Ch'ing intellectuals to rethink what literature in general, and fiction in particular, could do, and pave the way for further development in the May Fourth and later fictional writings.

304015184,"Jian, Xiaobin",Spatialization in the Shiji,Ancient,"By examining Sima Qian's (145-?90 B.C.) Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian), this study discusses the practice of spatialization in traditional Chinese narrative. The study examines elements essential to the tradition of Chinese historiography as well as the contemporary issues facing the historian in question, and provides the historical context with which the Shiji interacted. it also compares the Chinese historian's practice with Western narrative theories and tries to establish a dialogue between the two and to gain more productive understandings of narrative as a whole. In particular, the study examines the working and effects of some spatialization strategies such as: the combination of the plot of attribute and the plot of law, categorization, juxtaposition, cross-reference, non-action framework, and non-closure ending. The study argues that because the presentation of the Shiji builds itself up in dimensions in space rather than develops itself through duration of time, the final result of such spatialization is not a representation of a unilinear path whose development may be followed but a stratified system whose totality may be apprehended. To be able to grasp the totality of our world or any issue presented to us is certainly one of the major human needs. Spatialization as an art of representing (or creating) generalized images of various human conditions certainly has been working very effectively, and thus demands fuller critical considerations.",1992,1992,Ph.D.,United States,The Ohio State University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, China, historiography",14,Columbus,Ohio,39.9862,-82.9855,United States
304243381,"Chen, Xiaoming",Towards a Confucian/Marxist solution: Guo Moruo's intellectual development to 1926,Contemporary,"Guo Moruo (1892-1978) was a major figure in the second half of the May Fourth era (1915-1925), a pivotal period in modern Chinese intellectual history. He was also one of the most vocal among early Chinese Communist intellectuals, recording elaborately in his numerous writings the major changes in his thinking when converting to Communism in the mid-1920's. This dissertation focuses on Guo's intellectual development to 1926 and delves into the complexity of his May Fourth and early Communist thinking. The dissertation shows that Guo's May Fourth thinking significantly transcends such themes as anti-traditionalism, nationalism, science, democracy, and romanticism, themes that are commonly believed to be the characteristics of the May Fourth era. The dissertation also explains that Guo turned to Communism in the mid-1920's largely because he had found in Communism a comprehensive solution to various problems in his personal life and in China and the world. Further, the dissertation shows that the Communist thinking that Guo had developed by 1926 is a combination of both China's traditional Confucianism and modern Western Marxism. Based on thorough research and with careful analysis of the complexity of Guo's thinking, this dissertation contributes not only to the scholarship on Guo but also to the understanding of the complex nature of the overall thinking of the May Fourth generation and of the relationship between Chinese tradition and the origins of Chinese Communist movement.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,The Ohio State University,NA,NA,"History, Biographies, China, Confucian, Marxist",14,Columbus,Ohio,39.9862,-82.9855,United States
305140040,"Mizuno, Norihito",Japan and its East Asian neighbors: Japan's perception of China and Korea and the making of foreign policy from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century,Modern,"This dissertation is a study of Japanese perceptions of its East Asian neighbors—China and Korea—and the making of foreign policy from the early seventeenth century to the late nineteenth century. Previous studies have overwhelmingly argued that after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japan started to modernize itself by learning from the West and changed its attitudes toward those neighboring countries. It supposedly abandoned its traditional friendship and reverence toward its neighbors and adopted aggressive and contemptuous attitudes. I have no intention of arguing here that the perspective of change and discontinuity in Japan's attitudes toward its neighbors has no validity at all. In this dissertation, through examination primarily of official and private documents, I maintain that change and discontinuity cannot fully explain the Japanese policy toward its East Asian neighbors from the early seventeenth to the late nineteenth century. The Japanese perceptions and attitudes toward China and Korea had some aspects of continuity. I also challenge previous studies' argument about the change in Japanese attitudes toward China. Although they have argued that Japan turned aggressive soon after the Meiji Restoration. I contend that kind of change did not occur at the time. In the first two chapters (Chapter 2 and 3), following the introduction, I examine the early modern Japanese perceptions of China and Korea and foreign policymaking by the Tokugawa shogunate (bakufu) (1603–1867). Chapter 2 focuses on the Tokugawa perceptions of and diplomatic relations with Korea. Chapter 3, focusing on Tokugawa China policy, examines the Tokugawa vision of the Chinese tributary system and policy toward China. In the subsequent two chapters (Chapter 4 and 5), I examine the Meiji government's perceptions and diplomatic attitudes toward China and Korea in the late 1860s and the 1870s. Chapter 4 focuses on the attempt of the Meiji government to establish a government-to-government relationship with Korea. Chapter 5 deals with two issues of the early Meiji Japanese policy toward China. This dissertation demonstrates the following two points. First, a broader perspective is required to understand Japan's attitudes toward its East Asian neighbors. Along with change and discontinuity, continuity is a necessary and valid perspective in respect to Japan's perceptions of and policies toward China and Korea. Second, change did occur after the Meiji Restoration, but it did not occur in the form of an aggressive posture toward China at the initial state of the Meiji period.

304575937,"Yu, Li","New ladders of success: Sichuan students in the transitional times, 1900-1920",Contemporary,"This Dissertation examines Sichuan students' attitude toward modern education in the transitional times. The text describes the intrinsic crisis of the civil service examination system in the late nineteenth century, the establishment of the new school system in the first decade of the twentieth century, and the birth of the first generation of the new political elite in Sichuan after the 1911 Revolution. It highlights the students' participation in the educational reform from their motives of career-seeking and social mobility rather than from their political sentiments such as radicalism, nationalism, and modernization. The study argues that without fundamental social and economic change, educational reform in inland China did not cause a substantial change in the students' traditional attitude towards education. The new school system, substituting for the abolished civil service examination system, functioned as a new ladder of success or a new elite recruiting mechanism for the students. The study suggests that statistical growth did not mean modernity. Tradition played an important role in inland China's modernization movements in the twentieth century by shaping the ways that were used to pursue the aims of the movements and the motives of the people who participate in the movements.

It explores the political, cultural, and social dimensions of military advising and the concept of military advisors as vehicles of transnational exchange. Between 1927 and 1938 over one hundred high-ranking German military officers traveled to China to advise Chiang Kai-shek and the Guomindang on military modernization and industrialization. The German advisors quickly learned that they could not impose German institutions and technology on China but rather, they needed to adapt to the foreign environment and situate their reforms within the Chinese context. The project required extensive archival research in Germany and the United States. Close readings of primary sources, including reports from the German military mission and the German Foreign Office as well as the personal papers, correspondence, and recollections of the advisors, have shed light on their experience and efforts to transform the Chinese army from a conglomeration of poorly trained and armed feudal warlord armies into a modern national military capable of defending the country against Japanese encroachment. Many of the advisors adapted to living and working in China and reconciled their foreign service with their sense of duty to the Fatherland. In China, German officers found a place to further hone their military skills while the Treaty of Versailles prevented them from practicing their craft in Germany. The advisors believed they were cultivating a future German ally and a bulwark against the rising tide of communism in Asia. The German military mission also promoted Sino-German trade, which took on added importance after the Nazis came to power in 1933 and launched their policy of rearmament. The increase in armaments production required greater access to raw materials. China possessed vast supplies of raw materials, which it traded with Germany in exchange for armaments. The Sino-German relationship during the interwar period pivoted around the German military mission. Nazi foreign policy complicated the work of the German military mission in China. While official German foreign policy in East Asia remained one of neutrality from the Weimar era to the Third Reich, the Nazis began leaning noticeably closer to Japan as the 1930s progressed. The German army, however, supported a closer Sino-German relationship. The advisors recognized that a Sino-Japanese war would almost certainly bring an end to the burgeoning Sino-German relationship and thus sought to prevent war between the two Asian powers. They hoped that a strong Chinese military would deter Japanese aggression. Ironically, while the advisors worked to modernize the Chinese military in order to deter a Sino-Japanese war, the improvements made by the Chinese military under German supervision played a significant role in transforming what could have been a limited incident in 1937 into the beginning of World War II in Asia. This dissertation contributes to our understanding of the origins of World War II and the connections between the Asian and European theaters.

This dissertation examines the interplay of power, culture, and empire during this key transitional period. I explore the ideology of empire in the development of national identity as China was transforming itself from a traditional empire to a modern nation, Japan was aspiring to become a modern empire, and the United States as a modern nation was debating the meaning and consequences of exerting its power abroad. The ideology of empire played a role in determining who was defined as a citizen in each of the empire-nations, definitions often based on cultural attributes that could be acquired by outsiders. The Japanese government, for example, endeavored in the Meiji period to inculcate a sense of loyalty and nationhood in the population by manipulating the emperor ideology and the meaning of national essence. I look at the often contradictory images that Americans held of the Chinese and Japanese at various junctures during this period, such as the Chinese as both hopeless heathens and promising pupils, and demonstrate that these dual images stemmed from paradoxes in Americans' own self-image. Americans were also ambivalent about Japan's power, simultaneously admiring the nation's modernization and fearing it as a potential rival, while China tried to adapt to the framework of international power politics. I argue that culture was an important element in determining how relations among these three nations were constituted. American missionary women, for instance, were agents of cultural transmission, acting as “beneficent imperialists.” Chinese women activists looked to Western, and particularly American culture, hoping to discover the source of what they perceived to be American women's social and economic power as they sought to define what it might mean to be a modern Chinese woman. Hence, power, culture, and national identity were inextricably intertwined during this transitional period. Sources for this study include Chinese and U.S. diplomatic archives, missionary letters and reports, American newspapers and popular magazines, and Chinese women's magazines.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,The Ohio State University,NA,NA,"History, History, American history, China, Culture, Japan, Missionaries, National identity, Power, United States",14,Columbus,Ohio,39.9862,-82.9855,United States
305319734,"Yu, Li","A history of reading in late imperial China, 1000–1800",Modern,"This dissertation is a historical ethnographic study on the act of reading in late imperial China. Focusing on the practice and representation of reading, I present a mosaic of how reading was conceptualized, perceived, conducted, and transmitted from the tenth to the eighteenth centuries. My central argument is that reading, or dushu , was an indispensable component in the tapestry of cultural life and occupied a unique position in the landscape of social history in late imperial China. Reading is not merely a psychological act of individuals, but also a set of complicated social practices determined and conditioned by social conventions. The dissertation consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 discusses motivation, scope, methodology, and sources of the study. I introduce a dozen different Chinese terms related to the act of reading. Chapter 2 examines theories and practices of how children were taught to read. Focusing on four main pedagogical procedures, namely memorization, vocalization, punctuation, and explication, I argue that the loud chanting of texts and the constant anxiety of reciting were two of the most prominent themes that ran through both the descriptive and prescriptive discourses on the history of reading in late imperial China. Chapter 3 delineates a culture of reading dominated by males through a discussion of key elements of this culture: reading habits, the treatment of books, the hygiene of reading, reading paraphernalia, the elite conceptions of reading, and popular attitudes toward reading. Chapter 4 investigates women's reading, including their road to literacy, and representations of what and how they read. I argue that what caused the growing patriarchal anxiety over women's education during the late imperial period was not the rise in female literacy or the growth of female erudition, but rather the expansion of women's literate practices, particularly writing in the sphere of men. Chapter 5 probes the questions of why and how non-Han peoples learned to read Chinese. I investigate the cases of four different groups: “alien rulers” (Khitans, Jurchens, and Mongols), Jesuits, Chinese Jews, and Koreans. Chapter 6 reflects on the influence of the culture of reading on contemporary Chinese society, offers pedagogical considerations of teaching Chinese as a foreign language, takes issue with some Western paradigms of reading and orality, and provides suggestions for future research.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,The Ohio State University,NA,NA,"History, Literacy, Reading instruction, Education history, Womens studies, China, Imperial, Pedagogy, Reading",14,Columbus,Ohio,39.9862,-82.9855,United States
305496928,"Waelchli, Mary Jo","Abundant life: Matilda Thurston, Wu Yifang and Ginling College, 1915–1951",Contemporary,"Ginling College was a pioneer institution of higher education for women in China founded by Western Christian missionaries. When Ginling opened its doors in 1915, traditional gender segregation and notions of female behavior precluded the entry of women into China's universities. In the years after the 1919 May Fourth Movement and its challenge to traditional society and thought, co-education became the dominant pattern in Chinese higher educational institutions, but Ginling continued as one of two Christian women's colleges. In order to better understand the history of Ginling College, which was a cross-cultural enterprise, a partly institutional and partly biographical focus was employed. Ginling's first president, Matilda Thurston (1875–1958), was an American missionary educator who went to China to Christianize the Chinese. Although this hope was far from being realized, Thurston played a role in promoting higher education for Chinese women. In 1927, Matilda Thurston was forced to resign when rising nationalist sentiment demanded a Chinese president. Wu Yifang (1893–1985), a Chinese Christian and a graduate of Ginling's first class—and thus one of China's first college-educated, professional women—headed a majority Chinese administration after 1927. A liberal educator who continued the college's expansion and Sinification, Wu also held important positions in Christian, women's and government-related organizations in China. Thurston and Wu both believed that separate women's colleges were the best way to cultivate female leaders and fought to maintain Ginling's independence. Although the two presidents had some success in enlarging the scope of their work and the college enrollment, their goals were ultimately difficult to attain because they operated in a Republican China wracked by war, revolution, and intellectual and social change. Using college records and the personal papers, published articles, speeches, and recollections of its two presidents as well as faculty, staff, alumnae and former students, the lives of Matilda Thurston and Wu Yifang are explored. The college history is also traced from its founding after the 1911 Republication Revolution to its demise following the outbreak of the Korean War, when Western-subsidized educational institutions became unacceptable to the Chinese Communist government.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,The Ohio State University,NA,NA,"History, Religion, Biographies, China, Ginling College, Missions, Thurston, Matilda, Wu Yifang",14,Columbus,Ohio,39.9862,-82.9855,United States

As a case study of intellectual production derived from the interaction between an East Asian sociopolitical milieu and various strains of Western feminism, this dissertation contributes to cross-cultural feminist scholarship and to East Asian studies. In this dissertation, I argue that the emergence, decline, collapse, and reemergence of autonomous women's movements in twentieth-century Taiwan can be attributed to the changing political situation on the island. During periods of soft authoritarianism in the Japanese colonial era and postwar Taiwan, autonomous women's movements emerged and operated within the political perimeters set by the authoritarian regimes. In contrast, during periods of hard authoritarianism, the autonomous women's movement collapsed and was not given the political space to reemerge in the highly oppressive political climate. In 1895, China ceded Taiwan to Japan after the former was defeated in the first Sino-Japanese War. In the early 1920s, Taiwanese feminist discourses emerged within the context of the Japanese colonial government's greater tolerance of political dissent in Taiwanese society. With the rise of Japanese militarism from late 1931, the intensified repression of the Japanese colonial government toward Taiwan's sociopolitical movements led to the collapse of the women's movement. With the defeat of Japan in World War II, Taiwan was restored to the Chinese Nationalist government. From 1945 to the late 1960s, the highly repressive political climate that developed under Chinese Nationalist rule was not conducive to political dissent or to the reemergence of an autonomous women's movement. It was not until the early 1970s that the postwar autonomous women's movement emerged within the context of the authoritarian regime's greater tolerance for social and political dissent in Taiwanese society. During the era of democratization in the post-1987 period, Taiwan has witnessed the emergence of diverse strains of feminist discourses and various non-government women's organizations.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,The Ohio State University,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, China, Discourses, Feminist, Taiwan, Women's movements",14,Columbus,Ohio,39.9862,-82.9855,United States
4680000079,"Zhang, Miaosi",Taken from Nature: Sino-British Medical Encounters in the Early Modern Period,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the exchange of medicinal plants and medical practices between China and Britain in the early modern period. Using knowledge of materia medica such as tea, rhubarb, china root, and camphor as the entry point and drawing on archival and primary source materials collected in Britain and China and in Chinese and English, I show that scientific and medical research was inextricably bound up with commercial interests for the British Empire. Missionaries and explorers introduced China’s achievements in medicine and its practitioners’ rich knowledge in materia medica to European audience. The long-term trade routes led European merchants, physicians, and apothecaries into the global intellectual pursuit of medical botany. All of these contributed to competitive voices in creating, circulating, and consuming knowledge related to materia medica and medical practice from China. The appropriation of Chinese medicinal plants in early-modern England was forged through the creation of scholarly, commercial, and cultural discourses on the commodities. This particular mode of transmission was significant to understand the conflicts between the prerequisite knowledge through texts and the actual experience of consuming the commodities in the commodification of exotic remedies in early-modern England. The process also revealed that, learned physicians and domestic practitioners were equally crucial to the appropriation of exotic remedies. Learned physicians served as intermediaries between lay practitioners and exotic ingredients by accommodating these exotic herbs in through vernacular medical writings. Domestic practitioners, enforcing these remedies in daily life, made them part of early-modern English medical culture.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Pennsylvania State University,NA,NA,"Materia medica, Medical history, British Chinese exchange, International trade, Medicinal plants, Early Modern era,",1,State College,Pennsylvania,40.7909,-77.8567,United States

This dissertation relies on Chinese primary source collections, periodicals from China and the Caribbean, archival sources in the Caribbean and United States, and interviews to trace the evolution of China's relations with the region. In 1959, China gained its first ally in the region following the successful revolution of Fidel Castro. China played an important role in the early years of Castro's regime, competing with the USSR for pre-eminence in the communist world. However, Beijing's response to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 led Cuba to break ties with the PRC and set the tone for China's limited appeal to the region throughout the 1960s to fringe political radicals. In the late 1960s, China's objectives changed, and the Third World became a necessary buffer to offset worsening relations with Moscow and vacillations about rapprochement toward United States. The Anglophone Caribbean became an important space for China to show it was a different type of super-power; an atomic power that understood the pangs of colonialism viscerally. This dissertation is the first examination of China's relations with the Anglophone Caribbean during the Cold War. In 1972, Guyana and Jamaica became China's first two allies in the Anglophone Caribbean. Caribbean leaders like Forbes Burnham (Guyana) and Michael Manley (Jamaica) wrestled with what a relationship with China meant; a potential third way between the USSR and US, and an affirmation of non-alignment in foreign affairs, showing China's conflicting reputation across the Third World. China used cultural diplomacy to soften its image and create trans-national bonds. However, rhetorical help would only go so far, and the small Caribbean nations still faced sputtering economic development in the decade following independence. China became an unlikely engine for Guyana's Prime Minister Forbes Burnham’s campaign to """"Feed, Clothe, and House the Nation""""; Guyana became the site of China's first foreign aid project in the Western Hemisphere and worried lawmakers in Washington the small Caribbean nation was using the PRC as a model.

304411519,"Yamamoto, Masahiro",The history and historiography of the Rape of Nanking,Contemporary,"The Rape of Nanking, one of the most controversial war atrocities in the 20th century, occurred in 1937-38 following the Japanese Army's occupation of Nanking, then the capital of China, during the second Sino-Japanese War. A large-scale execution of prisoners of war and men of conscription age characterized the first phase of this incident, while numerous cases of violent crimes committed by individual soldiers happened in the second phase. The Japanese conducted the first phase to ensure the safety of an imperial family member who was one of their commanders, when they faced a large number of prisoners of war, plain-clothed soldiers, and those suspected of having been ex-soldiers. This phase, which claimed a majority of the atrocity victims estimated to have ranged from 20,000 to 50,000 people, was typical of modern warfare in which the distinction between combatants and noncombatants is obscure. The second phase was attributable to the soldiers' lack of discipline, a phenomenon transcending time. Although Western observers initially blamed the incident on the Japanese Army's loss of control over the soldiers, they reinterpreted the incident as a systematic massacre comparable to Nazi atrocities as a result of continuous media reporting about Japanese atrocities during World War II. The Tokyo War Crimes Trial after the war was unable to reconcile these two conflicting images and sentenced the Japanese commander in Nanking to death while finding him guilty only of disregard of duty. Although many scholars have debated the cause, nature, and scale of the Rape of Nanking, emotion and political considerations have affected the course of the debate so deeply that the gap between the traditionalists, who agree with the Tokyo War Crimes Trial version of the incident, and the revisionists, who refute it, has not been narrowed.

It plays an essential role in assessing Pleistocene hominid adaptation and behavior, and defining Paleolithic cultural/technological traditions and transitions in North China and greater East Asia. However, the paucity of published original research hinders the accessibility of this rich archaeological collection and forces many discussions concerning this locality speculative and far-fetched. This dissertation makes a comprehensive study of this site and the rich data-set from it. Major topics covered by this study include geology, stratigraphy, chronology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, lithic analysis, and a discussion of the current practice and theoretical framework of Paleolithic research in China. The centerpiece of the study is lithic analysis, including artifact typology and variability, core reduction, tool retouch and modification, and raw material exploitation and economy. Through these analyses, a series of theoretical and empirical questions are addressed, such as the nature of stone tool variability at the site, the capability and preferences of the Locality 15 hominids in handling the available raw materials and modifying lithic tools, the restrictions of raw materials placed on stone tool technology and stylistic features, the interaction between nature and hominids at the site, and the proper placement of the Locality 15 industry in Paleolithic cultural traditions and developments in North China. This study found that sophisticated direct hard hammer percussion was employed as the principal flaking technique to exploit vein quartz at the site, which is very distinctive from the Sinanthropus industry at Zhoukoudian Locality 1. However, the presence of Levallois technology at the site, as often mentioned, cannot be verified by this study. The dominant tool type is simply modified sidescrapers. The stone tools’ informal features, minimal modification, and variability in morphology and edge are perceived as closely related to raw material quality and availability and mainly the function of the original blank forms.

303818162,"Ho, Koon-wan",Politics and factionalism: K'ou Chun (962-1023) and his 't'ung -nien',Medieval,"This study is on K'ou Chun, the early Northern Sung statesman who made his name in Chinese history by the conclusion of the Treaty of Shan-yuan in 1005 with the Northern Empire of the Liao, which brought about the peace between the two countries for more than a century. Apart from discussing K'ou Chun's role in the 1004 crisis, this study attempts to view Sung bureaucratic factionalism from a new perspective through examining the activities of K'ou Chun and his t'ung-nien, candidates who obtained their chin-shih degrees in the same year. It is found that the chin-shih of the 980 examination including K'ou Chun and Wang Tan (957-1017) gradually built up a powerful faction through their t'ung-nien relationship. This faction dominated the Sung court for more than thirty years since the middle of Emperor T'ai-tsung's reign (r. 976-997). Their chief rival factions, interestingly, also came from two other t'ung-nien groups headed by Chang Ch'i-hsien (943-1014) and Wang Chin-jo (962-1025), respectively. Historically, bureaucratic factionalism always intertwined with court politics. It was no exception for early Northern Sung. Since K'ou Chun and his faction were deeply involved in the succession questions of Emperor T'ai-tsung and Chen-tsung (r. 997-1022), this study also focuses on the power struggle that took place in the inner court. K'ou Chun ultimately lost in the power struggle and died in banishment. However, his faction still managed to keep its influence during Empress Dowager Liu's (r. 1023-1033) regency when its junior members, headed by Wang Tseng (978-1038) and Lu I-chien (978-1043) gradually came to power. K'ou Chun and his faction were traditionally praised as gentlemen, while their rivals were mostly condemned as petty men. Such a view will be examined through the study of their behaviors.

His life and thought illustrates the uneasy relationship between political revolution and cultural conservatism among the intellectuals of his generation, and his advocacy of preserving the national essence paved the way for the far-reaching National Essence Movement in the early twentieth century. This dissertation, thus, represents a study of the tension between politics and culture among Chinese intellectuals and the significance of cultural conservatism during that era. Chang's concern to preserve the national essence was not only because he was a classical scholar, and therefore, felt a responsibility to uphold classical teachings, but also because he believed it was essential for the survival of the nation. Under pressure from Western powers, Chang was afraid that Chinese culture was threatened with extinction. In order to prevent foreign conquest, Chang believed that reform or revolution in China was necessary, and that the most important mission of the reformer or revolutionary was to preserve her unique culture. Therefore, he gave priority to the preservation of the national essence over that of the nation. The latter was important only because it was needed to save the former. And reform or revolution was in turn necessary to save the nation. Chang's lifelong commitment to the preservation of the national essence manifested itself in his two careers: one as a political activist and the other as a classical scholar. Even after the establishment of the Republic of China, Chang remained active in the political arena. He continued to speak out against whatever he perceived to endanger China's sovereignty or its culture. Apart from his involvement in politics, Chang also devoted himself to teaching and the study of China's rich cultural heritage.

The first three chapters examine the institutions pertaining to the selection and promotion of the Sanya commanders, concluding that the Northern Song selected and promoted for high army command ranks men whose loyalty to the throne had been tested and proven. It is further demonstrated that the Northern Song exercised effective control over its army commanders and had their powers scrutinized by civil officials, the majority being southern bureaucrats advanced through the civil service examinations. The two chapters that follow analyze the social and geographical backgrounds of the Sanya commanders, revealing that elite members of the Northern Song military in general enjoyed special ties to the emperors and the ruling house. Such imperial connections safeguarded their political and family fortunes from rapid downward sliding. The Northern Song elite, as such, was a self-perpetuating elite group, composed of predominantly northern military men who were closely associated with the dynasty’s founding elite. The remaining chapter in the body text further sheds light on the super elite status of the Sanya commanders, attesting that they were among the highest paid office-holders in the Northern Song and were recipients of high political honors and privileges. This study calls into question the received view of the inferior status of the Northern Song military elite. I suggest that during the Northern Song period a unique and distinctive balance between aristocratic and bureaucratic forces was achieved whereby state power was split between the semi-hereditary northern military elite and the newly arisen professional, bureaucratic elite. The ruling class of Northern Song society was therefore neither thoroughly aristocratic nor thoroughly bureaucratic, contrary to the generally held assumptions about the nature of the Song elite. In my opinion, the rise of southern civil leadership in state and society around the mid-eleventh century challenged, for the first time in Chinese history, northern aristocratic monopoly of state power and eventually precipitated its demise by the Southern Song.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of Arizona,NA,NA,"History, China, Commanders, Northern Song, Sanya, Song dynasty",14,Tucson,Arizona,32.1541,-110.8787,United States

The Song people, in the meantime, suffered an unprecedented humiliation when their two emperors were captured and taken as hostages to the north by the invading Jin army. As the Song regime was collapsing, Zhao Gou (1107–1187), later referred to by his temple name as Song Gaozong (r. 1127–1162), strove to ascend the throne and perpetuate the Song regime in the south—known to historians as the Southern Song (1127–1279). The process was difficult not only because the Song emperor himself was relentlessly pursued by the Jin army, but also because the Song itself could hardly decide on an appropriate policy regarding the invaders. It took nearly sixteen years for the Song to finally settle in south China and obtain formal recognition from the Jin as a sovereign state. This dissertation adopts a method which focuses on studying the interactions between Song Gaozong and his series of ten chief councilors in shaping the future of the Southern Song. The successive chief councilors, appointed by Song Gaozong, are studied based on the Song records with special attention to their interactions with the emperor in discussing important issues. The dissertation evaluates each chief councilor’s performance and explains why some chief councilors stayed in power longer than others. The dissertation also expounds how the Song emperor maintained a balance between two conflicting factions and how he struggled to consolidate his power in adverse circumstances.

The conflict between General Han Shizhong and Emperor Gaozong was focused upon the latter’s goal of maintaining the reality of the Southern Song and realizing the former’s ideal. The conflict intensified as the emperor quickened his pace of making peace with the Jins at the time when the Southern Song’s military forces were in the offensive position.

The tea and horse exchange was taken as a case to test the thesis that the economic policies implemented in Szechwan by the Sung government were a means to strengthen its defensive power. Although this is not an exploratory study on the role of the tea and horse exchange during Sung times, this study attempts to present its operation in a new and realistic perspective. Modern Western and Chinese scholars share the viewpoint that the expansion of the Sung to Szechwan was based upon an imperialistic motivation. The tea and horse exchange was a typical example of capitalizing upon the Szechwan resources and colonizing the minorities there. However, based on historical evidence, this study assumes that basically the Sung government wanted to maintain peace. Through the implementation of the tea and horse exchange, it was able to achieve a peaceful ethnic relationship in the southwest frontier. Some economic improvements were seen in the southwest minority areas after the exchange. Moreover, horses could be obtained, which were used, to a certain extent, to strengthen the Sung's military power although there were some problems. There are two major parts in this study. The first part attempts to present the general importance of Szechwan. It presents a prosperous picture of Szechwan on the eve of the establishment of the Sung dynasty. Due to the socio-economic heritage in Szechwan, special economic policies were implemented there by the Sung government in order to encourage further development, which could support its military. Some major policies are discussed in this part. In the second part, there is a study of the problem of the shortage of horses for military use, resulting in the implementation of the tea and horse exchange.

The focus of the present study, however, is limited to an examination of Wang Ken, the man, his key philosophical beliefs, and his role in the founding of the T'ai-chou School of thought. In exploring the genesis of Wang Ken and his school of thought, certain aspects of the social milieu are examined in order to reach a better understanding of how the larger environment and this radical intellectual movement became intertwined. In other words, I have attempted to discern and define the interplay of the most important creative minds of the time, and particularly those of the elite class with this group. As a teacher and thinker Wang Ken exercised a considerable influence on his times, contributing in the process to the new permissiveness so characteristic of the latter half of the Ming dynasty. In this regard, the present study also represents an attempt to discover the basic patterns underlying Wang Ken's thought, as well as the T'ai-chou School's responsiveness to dramatic changes in society. In doing so, we perceive an implication of intellectual autonomy in the form of social and political protest against imperial autocracy. Also, the spread of his faith in an attainable and intelligible sagehood among the lower classes, gradually blurred the dividing line between elite and commoner. Finally, the assertions of Wang Ken and the T'ai-chou School indeed stimulated a new sense of self-awareness and self-worth. Nevertheless, it is because of its radical rejection of the established social, political, and intellectual order that the T'ai-chou School has been branded as heterodox.

305026101,"Cha, Ga-Ju",The lives of the Liao (907–1125) aristocratic women,Medieval,"The Liao dynasty, founded by the Khitans who originated from the northeast corner of Manchuria, is often characterized by its women’s exceptional political authority and high social standing. This dissertation investigates various activities of the Khitan aristocratic women, particularly the imperial women, in the public realms, such as politics, military, and court ceremonies. In addition to Chinese official dynastic histories, this study utilizes archaeological data obtained largely from excavation reports of the Liao tombs that produced female occupants. This dissertation is intended to reconstruct as concrete picture of their lives as possible by adopting an interdisciplinary approach. In doing so, it seeks to explain how and why the Khitan women of the Liao dynasty were granted such high social prestige and political power. It also contemplates on the question whether the Khitans were assimilated by the Chinese culture by the late dynastic period. The first part of this study is focused on analyzing the patterns of the Khitan imperial marriage and their traditional inheritance practices in the context of the consolidation of the empire. The Liao imperial clan, the Yelü, maintained an exclusive marriage alliance with another ruling clan, the Xiao, which produced all of the Liao empresses during the entire dynastic period. This marriage alliance, devised to ensure their monopoly of power, eventually worked for the advantage of the Xiao women, as well as their clansmen who dominated the Liao political power. Women’s conspicuous participation in various public affairs was deeply rooted in the Khitan tribal tradition. The Khitans lacked the Chinese concept of segregation of gender roles and the Khitan women were employed at the court in the capacity of a religious professional (shaman) or even as a military commander. The observation of the mortuary practices of the Khitan suggests that they remained attached to their cultural traditions until the late dynastic period.

Close scrutiny of data however reveals a cluster of new values for Song women evident through personal cultivation and devotional practices both “within” and “without” the inner sphere. This dissertation offers a preliminary investigation of Song women’s practices such as bodily and spiritual cultivations as well as their devotional and philanthropic activities. It examines why and how these specific inner and outer practices evolved into regnant womanly practices that ultimately becarne exemplary behaviors during the Song period. Through the lens of female daily practices, this study also investigates the diverse interactions between genders in the Song era. The first part of this dissertation explores Song women’s bodily and spiritual observances within the inner quarters. Song women performed bodily cultivations through various forms of ascetic behaviors, including fasting, vegetarianism, the abstinence from slaughtering living beings, and seclusion in their daily lives, which can be deemed gendered practices. Spiritual cultivation through religious practices such as sūtra recitation and other related observances functioned not only as accessible avenues of female spiritual pursuits, but also served as alternative conduits for Song women’s literary aspirations. Part Two first discusses the gender discourse and the tension between the norms and historical reality during the Song. The last two chapters examine Song women’s practices such as their religious offerings and involvement in community public works and philanthropy outside the domestic realm. In contrast to women’s inner practices, women’s outer sphere endeavors put their personal cultivation and volition into practice, and also extended their influential financial autonomy beyond the domestic arena into the greater society. This study concludes that despite deviations from conventional Confucian values, these inner and outer womanly practices were perceived as paragons of female virtues.

It explores why and how Dizang, an obscure figure from the pre-Chinese Buddhist pantheon, became in medieval China an important object of cult worship. A tendency to focus on the popularized characterization of Dizang as “ the savior of the damned” has distorted scholarly understanding of this Bodhisattva, obscuring other developments of his personality, including afterlife trends other than the underworld function. To arrive at a more accurate re-construction of the medieval Chinese Dizang cult, this study examines a diverse range of evidences (canonical and non-canonical, textual and visual, as well as Buddhist and non-Buddhist) so as to ferret out threads of Dizang belief not documented in standard sources. Non-canonical sources are particularly highlighted since they frequently capture largely neglected aspects of religious development which must be studied in order to uncover the full complexity of medieval Chinese Buddhism. In particular the formation of the Dizang cult supplies a crucial key to unlocking the larger cross-cultural patterns of religious assimilation operating in medieval Chinese society, which have wider implications for the study of Chinese religion. Previous studies on sinification in Chinese Buddhist history have focused on a particular thinker, a specific text, a single doctrinal concept, or one ritual practice, thus demonstrating the development of only one pattern of assimilation and reducing the complexity of the cross-cultural dynamic in which assimilation really took place. The Dizang cult instead allows one to better contextualize the patterns of cross-cultural assimilation in medieval Chinese religion. What distinguishes the Dizang cult from other examples of sinification is the manner in which the figure of Dizang functions as a religious symbol that integrates diverse religious planes, doctrine, mythology, ritual, and soteriology. The Dizang cult, in short, offers a single but kaleidoscopic lens that encompasses a multivalent religio-cultural assimilation, thus resisting usual bifurcations between doctrine and ritual, as well as between so-called “elite” and “popular” religion.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Arizona,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Middle Ages, Buddhism, China, Cult, Dizang, Medieval",14,Tucson,Arizona,32.1541,-110.8787,United States
2707848729,"Zeng, Linjiao",Regional Buddhism in Action: The Rise and Fall of Lingyan Monastery from the Eastern Jin Dynasty to the Tang Dynasty,Pre-modern,"Lingyan Monastery, located in Jinan, Shandong Province, was a Buddhist monastery with a history of about 1600 years. It was first established in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, experienced several ups and downs, and arrived at its heyday in the Tang Dynasty. However, the history of Lingyan Monastery was rarely described in the historical records before the Song Dynasty. This dissertation thus will focus on the history of Lingyan Monastery from the Eastern Jin Dynasty to the Tang Dynasty in an attempt to sketch out its rise and fall on the basis of the existing gazetteers and Jinshi zhi. Moreover, it will explore the causes counting for the rise and fall of this renowned monastery. As a local Buddhist monastery, the rise and fall of Lingyan monastery was not the result of a single reason but a combination of factors both on the state level and on the regional level. The dissertation will employ the newly developed approach of Regional Religious System to investigate how these various factors interacted with each other to shape and transform Lingyan Monastery. The history of Lingyan Monastery within the scope of investigation is divided into three sub-periods. The first is the period of the Eastern Jin Dynasty and Sixteen Kingdoms period, in which Lingyan Monastery was established and rose to fame through the struggles with the indigenous religions in Shandong. The second is the period of the Northern and Southern, and Sui Dynasties, in which Lingyan Monastery established strong relationships with the local and central officials and became a well-known monastery with the bloom of Shandong Buddhism. The third period is the Tang Dynasty, in which the reputation of Lingyan Monastery spread across China, but at the same time, crises were hidden behind the prosperity which finally led to its decline. The rise and fall of Lingyan Monastery reflects the trend of Buddhist development in China in general on the one hand; on the other hand, it embodies distinctive regional features that have played important roles in the formation and transformation of Lingyan Monastery.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,University of Arizona,East Asian Studies,East Asian Studies,NA,14,Tucson,Arizona,32.1541,-110.8787,United States

By critically interpreting and understanding Buddhist cosmology through textual sources, visual representations, and religious practices during the late Ming dynasty, this dissertation examines the Buddhist ways of perceiving the world during early modern era and surveys the social-historical upbringing of Buddhist cosmological formations and expressions during that particular era. The Fajie anli tu is an explicit and orderly account of the configurations and structures of the Buddhist cosmos, the only text that solely focused on Buddhist cosmology in early modern China. This book reflects the best knowledge of late Ming Buddhists could perceive on Buddhist cosmology and the physical world around them. The text is well accepted in China since its first publication and has a far-reaching influence during its transmission to other parts of the world, especially Japan and Britain. Despite its breadth, depth and its historical values, this text remains hardly studied, and this dissertation is the first attempt to have a close examination of the text. This study focuses on a textual analysis of the Fajie anli tu to examine the ways through which Buddhist intellectuals perceive the cosmos. In addition, I bring the text into dialogues with non-textual materials that includes illustrations of Buddhist cosmos, Buddhist world maps, and actual practices to display a broader view of Buddhist cosmology in the late Ming dynasty. To this end, this study employs a variety of other documents that include government records, local chronicles, temple gazetteers, memoirs, and vernacular literature in addition to the Fajie anli tu and other Buddhist scriptures. In short, based upon a scrutiny of textual and non-textual materials, I argue that Buddhist cosmology in China—entangled with Chinese domestic philosophies and interpretations of different sects of Chinese Buddhist traditions in history—shifts from exhaustive literal and visual depictions of physical cosmos to philosophical justifications of the universe that emphasizes the supremacy of “mind” (xin 心). Also, by placing the Fajie anli tu within the larger social-religious background of the late Ming, I argue that the text is an important but scholarly-neglected pioneering work in the Chinese Buddhist campaign against the Western Jesuit missionaries during the late Ming.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,University of Arizona,East Asian Studies,East Asian Studies,NA,14,Tucson,Arizona,32.1541,-110.8787,United States

In contrast, there is a paucity of scholarship on how Chinese subjects beyond the social circles of the concessions learned and adapted photography for their own purposes, and how indigenous sensibilities, especially the methods and conventions in Chinese pictorial art, negotiated with the photographic technology of Western origin historically, aesthetically, and philosophically. My research fills this lacuna and rectifies the currently deficient, and hence distorted, accounts of early Chinese photography. What were the actual historical and institutional agencies that spread photography from the loci of the globalized, semi-colonial, foreign enclaves in the coastal cities to the vast, indigenous interior? Since the earliest Chinese to contact photography were the elite, either by status or by wealth, how did the court and the literati culture, alongside the emerging scholars of the New Learning, use the camera to implement their agendas, molding it to their interests and tastes? Finally, how did the camera embed itself into the ongoing radical social and political transformations that were occurring during the 1911 Xinhai Revolution? These are the principal questions I address in this dissertation. The modernist perspective in photography emphasizes the medium’s autonomy. However, I see photographs not as photographs per se, but as images fertilized by genres, conventions, and functions that transcend both culture and media. I explore photography’s dialogues with painting, drawing, rubbing, and print, and use images to seek shared visual formats, concepts, and strategies shared between East and West. I also explore the philosophy of technology undergirding the transitions and revolutions that transpire in the dynamics between the old and the new.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,Art History,Art History,"Chinese art, Chinese photography, Early Photography, Media studies, Qing studies,",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
2420000000,"Knorr, Daniel David ","Putting Empire in Its Place: Urban Elites and the Qing Imperial State in Jinan, Shandong, 1639–1926",Contemporary,"The focus of this dissertation is the history of Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, and the relationship between its elite class and the Qing (1644–1912) state. Jinan was much less commercially prosperous than the better-studied cities of central and southern China. Nevertheless, connections to other places were an important part of how Jinan’s elite identified with their city and reproduced their social status. Because of Jinan’s administrative importance, many of these connections were related to the operation of the Qing government. I frame the relationship between the state and local communities in terms of state-building and place-making, emphasizing that both processes are always ongoing and that they are mutually constitutive, not autonomous of each other. Although the mutual dependence of this relationship is especially apparent in Jinan, this framework helps explain similar patterns of what scholars have thought of as state-society interactions elsewhere. By engaging with scholarship on the U.S. state, I show that this pattern of state-building was not unique to China and suggest new possibilities for comparative analysis of state-building around the world. The dissertation spans three periods of Jinan’s history: the early and high Qing, the second half of the nineteenth century, and the early twentieth century. The over-arching chronological narrative is that the robust state-building of the first half of the Qing Dynasty was accompanied by and proceeded through intensive place-making and that this pattern persisted through the crises of the nineteenth century and continued to animate the late Qing reforms and the opposition of Jinan’s elite to the 1911 Revolution that overthrew the Qing. I analyze how Qing state-building incorporated a plurality of place-making projects through the lens of spatial politics. I argue that Qing spatial politics reflected many imperial characteristics but that it also contained nationalizing elements and so is best understood as a hybrid political formation. This idea of imperial-national hybridity helps explain the existence of a form of nationalism in early modern China, the growth of nationalism within the imperial state in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the persistence of imperial aspects of spatial politics beyond the fall of the Qing Dynasty.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,History,History,"City, Late imperial, North China, Place-making, Space, Translocal,",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

Most scholarship has painted a bleak portrait of this era’s interactions between China and the West, with stories of cross-cultural misunderstanding, legal disputes, and opium smuggling taking the fore in a conflict-centered narrative of the period preceding the Opium War. This dissertation, however, shows that conflict and misunderstanding were far from representative. Through a bottom-up reassessment of the daily lives and incentives of a multitude of actors on the South China Coast—merchants, sailors, interpreters, coolies, cooks, laundrywomen, prostitutes, pirates—it argues that active transnational problem solving and cooperation, not conflict, were in fact the norm. Driven by shared economic incentives, most Chinese individuals worked flexibly with their foreign counterparts to resolve problems on the ground level, long before they wended their way upward. By highlighting these processes of negotiation and relationship building, this research offers not only a substantial revision to how scholars understand the global history of late imperial China but also a more sensitive understanding of how people from different parts of the world, holding different worldviews, could make sense of and engage with one another in their daily lives.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,History,History,NA,65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

Early efforts to promote the expansion of industrial cotton production in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were met with mixed results. The industrialization of China’s cotton industry required the growth of American upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), a species that originated in Central America and that had fueled the Euro-American industrial revolution in textile manufacturing. Early attempts to import and disseminate large quantities of American cotton seeds weren’t sustainable because the seeds either didn’t grow well or quickly mixed with local cotton. Cotton science provided answers to these problems. Seeds were to be acclimatized to China’s local environmental conditions at experiment stations and distributed in a careful and systematic way to prevent them from mixing with other types of cotton. This dissertation subsequently explores how Chinese scientists not only sought to adapt varieties of American cotton to local environments, but also scientific efforts to remake the countryside in a way that prevented the mixing and deterioration of improved varieties of cotton.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,History,History,NA,65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

Many historians of missionary work have tended to look at missionaries in China as cultural imperialists and to consider missionary women as carriers of not only Christian messages but also the Victorian ideal of womanhood. A close examination of missionary women’s experiences at Ginling and Hwa Nan, as well as their interactions with Chinese women, provided a slightly different interpretation of the intercultural interaction. Although they highlighted Christian ideals regarding women’s roles, missionary women’s progressive educational philosophy and expansive views on women’s abilities and responsibilities enabled them to transform the ideology of domesticity into a means to enhancing women’s power and influence. In response to the gender and educational ideals of missionary women, Ginling and Hwa Nan students strategically adopted certain values while they discarded others. They inherited and applied American women’s progressive educational philosophy through rigorous academic learning and intellectual pursuits, and active involvement in social service programs and diverse extracurricular activities, while, at the same time, extending the notion of ideal Christian womanhood through actively participating in social and political movements. Both American women and Chinese women appropriated and made use of the dominant narratives of women’s domesticity to push forward a progressive educational agenda which broadened women’s spheres of influence. In addition, Chinese women’s agency revised the notion of American missionary women as cultural imperialists. Rather than a traditional institutional history, the dissertation frames individual stories of women’s agency and cooperation within Ginling College and Hwa Nan College against the changing social and political contexts in China from 1908 to 1952, revealing the uneasy coexistence of and struggles between Western Christianity and Chinese nationalism, and the complex and the intertwining patriarchal, colonial, and cultural ideologies that had shaped educated women’s experiences.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Iowa,Educational Policy & Leadership Studies,Educational Policy & Leadership Studies,"history of education, missionaries in China, women's higher education,",6,Iowa City,Iowa,41.6559,-91.5303,United States

The Opium War ushered in a new era of the Sino-Western relations and provided Protestant missions with access to millions of Chinese in the open ports. With a strong sense of moral and cultural superiority, the missionaries not only wanted to spread the Christian gospels in China, but also they desired to destroy Chinese cultural traditions which in their view were incompatible with Christianity. The Chinese, however, considered Chinese civilization the only true presentation of civilization and were extremely unresponsive to missionary messages. Within the context of cultural confrontation, the missionaries carried out their work, encountered indifference, if not overt opposition, and made unsatisfactory progress in the early decades regardless of their great commitment and sacrifices. The Ningbo mission was the first chief station of the Presbyterian China Mission and one of the major Protestant enterprises in China during the mid-nineteenth century. The work and experiences of the Presbyterian missionaries in Ningbo are representative of the general development and disappointment of the Protestant enterprise in China during its early stage. The Ningbo mission adopted the non-accommodation policy, took the bottom-up approach, and placed direct evangelism as top priority. This research tries to analyze the historical limits of those missionaries as well as to provide cultural explanations for how they chose the way they proceeded with their work. Missionary correspondences, journals, and memoirs provide research with a vivid human dimension. It is a history of a cultural enterprise, and it unfolds through the lives of a specific group of men and women in a given period and place.

Closely related to the story of China's modernization, the dissertation also argues that the Chinese proceeded on a journey of self-discovery through the intellectual “encounter”, with the “enemy.” In its course, the Japan hands revealed their private musings on their future as Chinese. They envisioned China entering into the family of nations while retaining a distinct Chinese identity. The first chapter provides an outline history of the Japan discourse from its beginnings in early imperial China, leading all the way up to the 1920s. Over this time, Chinese writings on Japan were highly derivative, failing to correspond to geopolitical realities. The Chinese cultivated a perception of the Japanese that was characterized by cultural arrogance and bias. The second chapter introduces the main protagonists of the Japan discourse and assesses their significance for Japan studies in Republican China. The third chapter reconstructs the process in which the Japan hands conceived Japanese history employing both Western-derived and traditional Chinese historiographical techniques. The fourth chapter analyzes Chinese attempts at understanding the Japanese national psyche. In the course of their investigation, the Japan hands developed a subtext designing a Chinese identity which was antithetical to the Japanese. The fifth chapter traces efforts of the Japan hands to debunk Japanese ideology (Japanism) of the 1930s as an artful construct. In weighing the pros and cons of glorifying one's own cultural heritage as an option for the Chinese to bolster their self-confidence, the Japan hands offered their thoughts on the nature of the Chinese nation.

304452527,"Huang, Tong-yi",Elite transformation and democratization in Taiwan,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines Taiwan's democratic transition, how it occurred, how it is best modeled, and whether Taiwan can now be considered a consolidated democracy. I employ elite theory and focus on elite transformation. I highlight two important but insufficiently studied developments among Taiwan elites that I believe constituted watershed events leading to an elite transformation from basic disunity to unity: the National Affairs Conference (NAC) of June 28-July 4, 1990, and the National Development Conference (NDC) of December 23-28, 1996. I first examine Taiwan's elite unity and differentiation and argue that elites before 1990 were best characterized as divided. Under martial law, the KMT ruthlessly repressed opposition elites, and the latter relied on extra-legal methods and mass mobilizations to challenge the regime. Especially during the 1950's and 1960's, elite differentiation was limited because the mainlander-military-ideologues dominated the party state and because the society was still quite underdeveloped. An elite transformation began after Lee Teng-hui succeeded to the presidency in 1988 and engineered a breakthrough in the NAC by cooperating with the Democratic Progressive Party. The NAC contributed to the integration of anti-system elites including former political prisoners and exiles. It also fostered a limited consensus among competing elite camps regarding a reform agenda. The period after the NAC witnessed considerable elite differentiation as Taiwanese and elected representatives gradually replaced the homogeneous mainlander-military elite. However, the new democratic regime remained unstable because elites continued to be split over the entangled issues of national identity and constitutional reform. Elites in Taiwan are best described as fragmented during the first half of the 1990's and the democratic regime is best viewed as unconsolidated during those years. A full consensual unification of elites became possible only during the cross-Straits crisis of 1995-96. In that crisis, competing elite camps reached consensus on the national identity issue and they agreed on the essentials of constitutional reforms before, during, and following the NDC in late 1996. Political developments since the NDC have shown that elite behavior is restrained by consensus and this makes the prospects for Taiwan's democratic consolidation bright.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,The University of Texas at Austin,NA,NA,"Political science, History, China, Democratization, Elite transformation, Taiwan",2,Austin,Texas,30.3005,-97.7522,United States

This dissertation uses four important stone-inscribed commemorative texts from the Jingjiao community, along with the larger historical record, to explore the ways leaders and well-placed lay people of the church sought to negotiate for the church and for themselves a place of belonging in China even as various dynamic forces within Chinese society contested that identity. A crucial part of Jingjiao’s context is the method of the church-state relationship that the Church of the East had learned under Sassanian rule and continued under Muslim rule, for the model of political and social integration with religious distinctiveness marked Jingjiao’s attempts to negotiate its place of belonging in Tang China. Beginning with the Jingjiao bei’s account of Jingjiao in the High Tang, this study also draws upon other transmitted and excavated texts to explore how Jingjiao leaders sought to negotiate a place for the church within the Tang state and society during the empire’s most secure and broad-minded period. Though Jingjiao experienced difficulty during the time of Wuzetian’s Zhou dynasty and the tumult of the restoration of the Tang, the record of Jingjiao’s response and efforts to reclaim its lost position reveal yet more of its strategy to negotiate a legitimate identity in China. A rhetorical analysis of the bei’s visual rhetoric as well as of its text preface and verse traces Jingjiao’s argument that, as China recovers from the devastation of the An-Shi Rebellion and emperor Dezong begins to institute reforms to restore a political structure nearer to that of preRebellion times, the Creator-God, the Three-in-One who reaches out to humankind through the Messiah, has blessed China when wise emperors honored Jingjiao, and He stands ready to bless emperor Dezong as he follows their precedent and honors God by securing the church’s place before the Court and, thus, in Chinese society. The study then draws primarily upon recently excavated commemorative stone inscriptions from three near-contemporaries from Luoyang’s Jingjiao community. Rhetorical analyses of the muzhiming of Han man (d. 827) and of his Sogdian wife (d. 821) draw upon historical context and studies of the muzhiming genre while comparing the oddly different texts in order to draw conclusions about the aspirations and social obstacles facing Christian, mixed Han-Sogdian families in 820s Luoyang. Next, the dissertation studies the innovative use of a Buddhist dharani pillar form to bear a Jingjiao devotional text and commemorative inscription at the grave of a Sogdian woman by her Han and Sogdian family upon her burial at Luoyang in 815. Then, the discussion weaves observations of the three commemorative stone inscriptions with the time’s intellectual and political currents that culminated in the Huichang Persecution of Buddhism and other foreign religions in China.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,The University of Texas at Dallas,Humanities - History of Ideas,History,"China, 618-907, Church of the East, Steles, Ethnic relations, Epitaph, Tang dynasty,",1,Richardson,Texas,32.9716,-96.7093,United States
2100000000,"Wells, Richard Evan","The Manchurian Bean: How the Soybean Shaped the Modern History of China's Northeast, 1862-1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the role the global market for soybeans and soybean products played in the history of modern Manchuria (northeastern China). During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Manchuria underwent drastic political, social, and economic transformation, experiencing mass immigration, war, industrialization, and imperialism. Scholars of the region have focused extensively on how the construction of railway networks precipitated and intensified these historical phenomena, invoking the concept of “railway imperialism” as a central explanatory device. This dissertation contributes a new perspective to this existing historiography by reframing the early-twentieth-century history of Manchuria as a narrative of the soybean trade. It argues that, during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, changes in how people living outside of Manchuria consumed soybeans and soybean-products radically transformed how governments, businesses, and individuals within the region interacted with one another and conceptualized the space of Manchuria. During the mid-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, Manchuria and the soybean were inextricably linked to one another. The region and the commodity were so inseparable that the soybean was widely known throughout the world as the “Manchurian Bean,” and Manchuria, the “Land of the Soybean.” In the early-nineteenth century, Qing officials, merchants, and farmers viewed Manchuria as a vital source of the soybean-based fertilizers that fueled a spectacular increase in cotton production in the fertile agricultural lands of the lower Yangtze River Valley. In the mid-nineteenth century, British merchants discovered that participation in the soybean trade was a prerequisite for establishing a commercial presence in Manchuria. Towards the end of the century, Manchuria’s status as a source of soybean-based fertilizers sparked Japan’s initial interest in the region, an interest that would culminate decades later in invasion and colonization. In the early twentieth century, scientists, manufacturers, and agronomists in Europe and the Americas discovered the soybean’s remarkable potential as an industrial material, foodstuff, and fertilizer. The subsequent surge in global demand for the commodity sent traders from throughout the world streaming into Manchuria, and people around the world came to identify Manchuria as the world’s leading producer and exporter of soybeans. With the outbreak of war in the 1930s, the soybean’s versatility as a protein-rich foodstuff, fertilizer, and source of industrial raw material led Japanese policymakers to see Manchuria as an indispensable part of the Japanese Empire and one of the central pegs of Japan’s wartime economy.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,History,History,"Social sciences, Capitalism, China, Commodity, Japan, Manchuria, Soybean,",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States

Both economies shifted into the high-end segment of information and communications technology (DRAMs, ASICs, PCs, telecom equipment, multi-media, software, etc.) manufacturing between 1985-1996. While Taiwan had previously been specializing in high-tech and lower-end IT primarily, Korea had been pursuing autos, steel, shipbuilding and DRAM industries. The study confirms the proposition that this change has been triggered by the spreading global communications revolution and its production factor frontier-knowledge imperative: the acquisition and generation of frontier-knowledge is required in order to design and integrate various communications technologies. Both governments were forced to facilitate the varying degrees of flexibility of their corporations and embedded autonomy of their bureaucracies. They needed to keep up with the hyper-speedy product cycles, to achieve certain spill-over effects into neighboring manufacturing and service sectors of their societies, and to reap higher margins and, thus, greater wealth. International markets showed greater demand for such goods in the late eighties through the mid-1990s as National Information Infrastructures (NIIs) were and are being built around the globe. Taiwan showed a more linear development from its earlier lower-end IT activities to more design-oriented, higher value-added products. Meanwhile, Korea progressed into similar sectors with a more abrupt shift. Its course correction was more dramatic. Taiwan's earlier and more open FDI and technology transfer orientation permitted it to smoothly progress into an alignment with the global information society and the knowledge imperative. Also, its more autonomous bureaucracy focused on the entrepreneurial culture on the island which proved crucial for flexible, customized ICT manufacturing. In contrast, Korea has had trouble with its centralized bureaucracy and the monolithic chaebol, both of which are not conducive to frontier-innovation. It was not able to align itself quite a swiftly with global information industry trends. However, thanks to the resource-wealth of the chaebol they have been able to comply with this new frontier-knowledge imperative quickly in the 1990s.

304089922,"Lin, Wen-cheng",Political integration and democratization: The case of Taiwan,Contemporary,"This thesis studies the evolution of Taiwan's political integration and democratization over the past four decades and examines the assumption that political integration serves as the basis of democratization. It focuses on the processes by which tensions are reduced between the Taiwanese and the mainlanders and on the development of a sense of national identity among the people on the island. This paper also analyzes the changing political attitudes of the people over the past forty years. Taiwan illustrates that political integration and democratization is not a one-way relationship. Increased political integration provided a more generous environment for democratization in Taiwan, while democracy was frequently used by the ruling elites as a means to promote the island's political integration. President Chiang Ching-kuo initiated the policy of Taiwanization to reduce the grievances of the Taiwanese, in order to mitigate the tension between the Taiwanese and the mainlanders. President Lee Teng-hui completed the congressional reform in 1991, which, to a large extent, ended the opposition's radicalism. The Democratic Progressive Party is now engaging in political reforms from within the political system rather than advocating the overthrow of the system from without. Taiwan's political integration is still incomplete. The people are still divided on their national identity, namely whether Taiwan should declare independence or be unified with mainland China. Because Taiwan's political integration is imperfect, every major move for democracy in the past five years has ignited a political storm. Taiwan's further democratization will proceed in a volatile atmosphere unless the issue of national identity is solved. Taiwan has, however, gone through the thorniest stages in its journey to become a full-fledged democracy. Democracy itself should be able to deal with the problems of an unsettled national identity.

In a phenomenon typical of colonialism, Tibetan nationalism has grown under the conditions of foreign conquest and rule despite every effort by the Chinese to eradicate it. The history of Tibetan nationalism and Sino-Tibetan relations may be divided into four periods. During the first period, from the beginnings of Tibetan history to the end of the Tibetan empire in 842, Tibetan national and political identity was consolidated over the territory and peoples of the Tibetan plateau. In the second period, from 842 to 1895, the Tibetan Buddhist state was organized and Tibet came under a feudal type relationship with Mongol and Manchu dynasties ruling China. In the third period, of the early 20th century, Tibetan nationalism was stimulated by British and Chinese imperialist threats. The first three periods are examined by an extensive review of secondary historical sources in European languages, including British and Chinese government documents in English and a synthesis of that material. In the fourth period, from 1950 to the present, Tibetan independence was forcibly eliminated by the Chinese conquest and Tibetan national identity came under intense pressure from repression of Tibetan nationalist resistance and campaigns for the socialist transformation of Tibetan society. The modern period of Tibetan history and Sino-Tibetan relations has been examined by using Chinese, Tibetan and international documentary sources in English translation as well as extensive interviews with Tibetan subjects. The dissertation ends with an examination of Tibet's legal case within international law, self-determination in international law, minorities rights in international law, minorities rights in theory and practice in the People's Republic of China, and the prospects for Tibetan self-determination.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,Tufts University,NA,NA,"International law, International relations, History, Political science, China, Tibet",3,Medford,Massachusetts,42.4234,-71.1087,United States

While objects from Europe were certainly prized, this dissertation examines the unusual preoccupation of the museum's first director, Frederic Allen Whiting, and first Curator of Oriental Art, J. Arthur MacLean, with sourcing, acquiring, and placing on display the very best examples of art objects and antiquities from China, Japan, and Korea. I argue that these individuals were not motivated by Orientalist fervor to acquire fine examples of East Asian material culture. instead, by engaging in what I call sympathetic appropriation , objects from Asia were carefully displayed in Cleveland's new museum, where they might serve a broad educational function. These pieces retained their existent cultural cachet even after being placed on display in Cleveland's museum. Following a historiographical discussion in the Introduction, my argument unfolds over five chapters and a Conclusion. In Chapter One I discuss the construction of the Cleveland Museum of Art vis-a-vis other large, urbane American museums, placing special emphasis upon the work of the museum's first Director and Curators to distinguish Cleveland's museum from peer institutions on the East Coast. Chapter Two focuses upon the impact of the American Arts and Crafts Movement on processes of collection at the museum. In Chapter Three I examine the motivations that inspired staff at the Cleveland Museum of Art to pay special attention to objects from East Asia. Chapter Four examines the museum's Oriental Expedition to Asia, led by the scholar-explorer Langdon Warner. In Chapter Five I discuss the perceived educational value of Asian art as displayed in Cleveland's museum. An analysis of the processes of acquisition employed by staff members at the Cleveland Museum of Art adds complexity to the existent historiography on collecting and appropriation in American museums. Additionally, this dissertation's examination of the methods of acquisition of East Asian material culture at the Cleveland Museum of Art serves as an excellent case study for analyzing collecting practices at smaller regional American museums in the early twentieth century.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,University of Akron,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, Museum studies, Asian art, China, Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art, Collecting, Japan",2,Akron,Ohio,41.0798,-81.5219,United States
251665396,"Brown, Miranda Dympna","Men in mourning: Ritual, human nature, and politics in Warring States and Han China, 453 BC–AD 220",Ancient,"This dissertation treats changes in early Chinese political culture through the prism of three years mourning. Chapter 1 traces ideas about the connection between mind, body, and ritual from the Warring States (453–221 BC) through Eastern Han (AD 25–220). Incorporating medical categories and terminology, Han ritualists elaborated the basic insights of their Warring States predecessors, arguing that the mourning rites were the natural and inevitable expression of human emotion. Chapter 2 treats Warring States and Western Han (206 BC–AD25) attitudes about kinship, as reflected in ritual prescription. Authors of ritual prescriptions believed that considerations of status should constrain expressions of sorrow through mourning. This belief was shaped by the concerns of statesmen about the negative effects of spontaneous expressions of affinity between kin. Chapter 3 analyzes shifts that occurred in the rhetoric of filial piety between the early Western Han and Eastern Han. Whereas official Western Han rhetoric stressed impartial public service, that of the Eastern Han increasingly focused on the body: safeguarding the body, properly disposing the body after death, and fulfilling through ritual emotional needs generated by human nature. Chapter 4 examines the startling attention Eastern Han mourning accounts give to depictions of the mother-son bond. Such attention can be explained in terms of the dominant associations of the mother-son bond: frequently depicted as emotional and private, the mother-son bond came to represent an ideological alternative to the early Han ethos of state service. Chapter 5 argues that the bond of son to mother, more so than that of son to father, or subject to lord, provided a rhetorical and ritual template for client-patron relations. Like mourning for a mother, mourning for a patron became an expression of opting out of state service. Chapter 6 challenges standard views that portray funerary inscriptions as attempts to flatter the social pretensions of paying customers. Such inscriptions also reflected assertions of autonomy from the court on the part of members of the local and political elites. Beliefs about the self, the family, and political association adopted by Eastern Han elites ultimately had a corrosive effect on dynastic authority.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"Ancient civilizations, History, China, Han dynasty, Human nature, Men, Mourning, Politics, Ritual, Warring States",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States

Half of the casualties were civilian. Republican China, not unlike the Union government during the American Civil War and the European states during the First World War, began to manage the war dead. My dissertation, titled “The Sovereignty of the War Dead: Martyrs, Memorials, and the Makings of Modern China, 1912–1949,” examines Republican China’s effort to collect, commemorate, and compensate military and civilian dead in the first half of the twentieth century. I analyze how various government policies, such as the construction of martyrs’ shrines in every county, the tracking of casualties by locality, the compilation of martyrs’ biographies, and the distribution of gratuities to families of the war dead, contributed to the processes of state-building and nation-making in China and shaped China’s social and cultural institutions in most profound ways. The toppling of the Manchu ruling class and the Confucian-educated elites did not lead to the construction of China as a nation of equal citizens. Republican China instead developed new political hierarchies through the promulgation of different regulations for compensating revolutionary predecessors, Party members, servicemembers, and bureaucrats, and their families exclusively. Conflicts of the unprecedented scale prompted the Nationalist state to extend its constituency by broadening the criteria for martyrdom to include civilians and pledging to provide for qualified bereaved family members. In exchange for recognition and compensation, family members had to demonstrate not only their allegiance to the party-state, but also their compliance to the moral codes prescribed by the state. As for the dead, their spirits dwelled in government-mandated Loyal Martyrs’ Shrines ( zhonglie ci ), where the living performed a combination of traditional and modern rituals to memorialize their untimely departure. My dissertation advances our understanding of violence in the modern age. In twentieth-century China, conflicts were viewed as rational political choices, inevitable in the modern age, and inseparable from human experience, laying the rhetorical ground for further violence. Examining the changes in compensation and commemoration law from the 1910s to 1940s, I demonstrate that two processes—the bureaucratization of death (the construction of deaths with numbers and formulaic narratives) and the civilianization of war (increased presence of civilians in war as victims, supporters and penetrators)—contributed to the routinization of violence in postwar China. Political struggles from the 1950s to the present testify to how wars of earlier decades have normalized death in the cultural, social, and economic realms. Furthermore, I propose that the dead have sovereignty as their oft-perceived formidable power in the afterlife necessitates that political, social, and cultural institutions develop the means to control the way by which they are remembered. The sheer number of the dead, the eerie specter of their wronged souls, and the multiplicity of their memorialized identities upset the core of human existence.",2017,2017,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,History,History,"Asian History, History, Cemetery, China, Compensation, Martyr, Shrine, War dead",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
2041037884,"Tiffert, Glenn Douglas",Judging Revolution: Beijing and the Birth of the PRC Judicial System (1906-1958),Contemporary,"The impact of the PRC legal system on the world is swelling, yet our grasp of its history and path dependencies rests on weak empirical foundations, a thin source base, and outmoded claims that distort our understandings of its past, present, and future. This dissertation tackles those deficiencies on two levels: first, by filling major knowledge gaps and dispelling chronic misperceptions about the birth of the PRC judicial system and, second, by reframing in time and space the 1949 revolution and China’s twentieth-century engagements with modernity. Specifically, the dissertation reinterprets the 1949 revolution by theorizing it not as an a priori rupture, but rather as an engine for recursively producing and negotiating difference. The dissertation unearths forgotten elements from China’s legal past and configures them in provocative ways to blast holes in the layered compartmentalizations that have structured the historiography of modern China, namely its temporal segmentation into Republican, Mao, and post-Mao periods, and the spatial and ideological cleavages that have sundered the Nationalist regime from the CCP’s coeval revolutionary base areas. In short, the dissertation aims to redefine the Republican-PRC transition, and firmly restore the PRC to Chinese historical time. Section One establishes an empirical baseline for assessing the revolution by mapping the condition of the Nationalist judicial system as it approached 1949. Section Two conducts a similar inquiry into the CCP’s Shaanganning border region and North China liberated area. It dispels the myth of an autochthonous CCP legal tradition by showing that the legal systems of these iconic base areas developed in deep dialogue with Nationalist China, and that this contact actually drove much of the dynamism in pre-1949 CCP legal policy and practice. The PRC judicial system therefore bore a congenital Republican imprint, not just from the institutions and personnel inherited from the ancien régime , but also more profoundly from the accumulated network effects of more than a decade of prior CCP engagement with Nationalist law. Reconceptualizing the PRC as an heir to Republican judicial modernization rather than as its antithesis empowers the dissertation to break new ground in the histories of signature practices such as people’s mediation, and on topics such as the rule of law and judicial independence. Section Three carries this framework into 1949 and beyond. Through a micro-history of the Beijing Municipal People’s Court, it not only supplies the first scholarly account of the CCP takeover and reconstruction of a major Nationalist state organ, but also shows the tortuous emergence of a new judicial system in unprecedented empirical detail. This tears the mask off of the monolithic CCP, and reveals the politics, tensions, and inconstancy that roiled inside. It exposes how, in the domain of law, the CCP bore multiple, competing visions of the revolution simultaneously, and as the balance of forces in the surrounding environment shifted, different equilibriums among these visions emerged, tracing a convoluted, sometimes violent course that reaches the present day. Time and again, the CCP has tapped this reservoir of legal diversity for adaptive solutions to political imperatives, which have then fed back into their surroundings iteratively. Reading that history as a dynamical system lends coherence to a series of otherwise serpentine fluctuations, most notably the stunning speed with which suppressed policies, and the persecuted people who once promoted them, resurfaced to jumpstart legal reconstruction after Mao’s death and the end of the Cultural Revolution. In this way, the dissertation decisively reframes our understanding of the present. Today, observers of Chinese legal reform often speak as if the PRC’s engagement with ideas such as constitutionalism, judicial independence, and human rights stretches back no more than a generation and takes it cues predominantly from the West. This impact-response paradigm has a long record in Chinese Studies and, insofar as it infantilizes the PRC, it distorts our grasp of a much more complex and protracted series of exchanges. To refute it, the dissertation historicizes post-Mao legal modernity by tying it directly to the founding decade of the PRC, and indeed still further back into the Republican era. This establishes a more balanced, alternate genealogy for current legal reform that better accounts for its distinctive trajectory and significations, and its vexing aberrations from international “best practices.”",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,History,History,"Asian History, Law, History, China, Court, Judge, Law, PRC, Revolution",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
305031628,"Chin, Tamara Ta Lun",Savage exchange: Figuring the foreign in the early Han dynasty,Ancient,"This dissertation examines notions of cultural foreignness in the historiography of China's earliest “foreign relations” and encounters with “the West.” It embeds these notions within the political context of the unprecedented expansion of the Han empire (202 BCE–220 CE), and within the literary and material innovations of this period. In doing so, it argues that Han debates over expansion focused on the evaluation and proper exchange of foreign objects, and not on descriptions of foreign peoples. Chapter I introduces this shift of the analytic subject from persons to objects through a rereading of pre-Han geopolitical writings (e.g. Mencius, Zou Yan, “The Tribute of Yu”). It explores the appropriation of these writings in Han debates over commerce, and in modern debates over sinocentrism, race and culture. Each of the remaining chapters takes as its theme a new form or crisis of exchange intimately related to Han imperialism. Each offers a reading of the work of the historian Sima Qian (ca. 145–ca. 90 BCE), and his preservation of the new genres promoted by empire (ethnographic report, fu -rhapsody). Chapter II analyzes the marriage and dowry exchange behind the controversial peace treaty ( heqin ) that dominated Han politics and instituted Chinese “foreign relations.” Read against Sima Qian's new “ethnography” of the northern enemy, the heqin treaty serves as a literary device linking kinship debates at the frontier with kinship debates at the heart of the empire. Chapter III pursues the hyperinflation, counterfeiting, and smuggling of coinage that accompanied Han expansion. Chapter IV explores the exotic words and exotic things of Sima Xiangru's new imperial fu -rhapsody, read within Sima Qian's narrative as a form of tribute from a conquered border region. Through these various accounts, the foreign figures and functions within the ideology of commercial exchange associated with imperial expansion, luxury, and linguistic excess, and in opposition to the classical “Confucian” defense of agricultural exchange, frugality, and local government.

304900002,"Rottmann, Allison","Resistance, urban style: The New Fourth Army and Shanghai, 1937–1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the relationship between the city of Shanghai and the Communist New Fourth Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. It is a multivocal exploration of wartime experiences that brings urban voices to the forefront of rural revolution. Before 1980, Maoist state policy required that Shanghai's significance to the growth of wartime Chinese Communism be historically ignored, and western scholarship followed suit. This study uses memoir sources published in recent decades to recover this history, arguing that the Shanghai style of resistance was a planned and focused movement of urban resources to promote rural-based Communist revolution, while also nurturing the movement's growth within the city throughout the war. This research reveals that agents of the New Fourth Army and Shanghai underground Party created clandestine trafficking lines between the city and the army's Central China Base Area to transfer human and economic resources to the countryside. Both gender and class shaped urban participation in the resistance, and the Communists competed with both the Chinese government and Japanese occupiers for limited resources. Personal contingencies like one's family situation or the need for income and wartime contingencies like the loss of one's home or job were as important as patriotism in recruiting people to the base area. Once there, the Party pragmatically converted urban recruits into Communist revolutionaries. The Shanghai-New Fourth Army relationship presents a distinct model of base-building and Communist expansion. The city's links with the army are characterized by a reliance on social networks ( guanxi ). Backed by entrepreneurs, modern professionals, middle school graduates, workers from modern industries, social and economic elites, small-business managers, and white-collar employees, the development of Communist power in the lower Yangzi River region was supported by commercial interactions and particularistic connections. Communist resistance in the cultural, political, and economic heartland of China was not isolated from modern urban, intellectual, and commercial trends but instead purposefully incorporated them into the revolutionary process. Similar to the seeds of Communism planted in the 1920s that nourished the wartime movement, the Shanghai style of resistance reemerged decades later to change the course of the Chinese revolution.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Gender studies, China, Chinese Revolution, New Fourth Army, Resistance, Rural revolution, Shanghai, Urban-rural, War of Resistance Against Japan",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
249993252,"Lloyd, Gregory Arthur",The two -storied teahouse: Art and politics in Lao She's plays,Contemporary,"Lao She (1899–1966) is one of China's most important modern writers. His life spanned all the major events of China's turbulent twentieth century history, from the Boxer Uprising to the Cultural Revolution. An ardent patriot though never an ideologue, his prolific writings and his dramatic personal saga provide invaluable cultural and social insight into those times. His often satirical yet always highly realist style is expressed through a graceful mastery of the Beijing vernacular. This has made him to this day the quintessential writer of his native city, China's longtime capital and the setting of most of his work. Lao She is primarily acclaimed for his prose fiction, such as novels Camel Xiangzi and Cat Country and short stories Black and White Li and Neighbors . While the remarkable play, Teahouse , counts among his signature works, he is not remembered foremost as a playwright. His twenty-four published plays, however, were written during two of the most critical periods in modern Chinese history. When the War of Resistance broke out in 1937, Lao She followed the Nationalist government to Chongqing. It was there he turned to modern drama as the most effective form of propaganda for the United Front against the Japanese invasion, After the Communists won the ensuing civil war, Lao She's patriotism and love for his hometown compelled him to return to Beijing. To help build the “New China,” once again he found plays to be his best contribution to national solidarity. This dissertation examines the interplay of dramatic aesthetics and political propaganda in Lao She's plays. Integral to this study is the tension between his own moral values and the policies or ideologies of the state regimes under which he wrote. It is thus imperative to examine his plays in the context of the history they reflect and the life and thought of their author. I have selected for close reading what I regard as the playwright's seven finest pieces. These include both Nationalist and Communist era works and represent the various genres into which I have found his plays are best divided for critical and historical analysis.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Theater, Biographies, Art, China, Drama, Lao She, Plays, Politics",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States

304037787,"Tai, Eiko",Taiwanese in Japan: A legacy of Japanese rule in Taiwan,Contemporary,"This study examines the ethnic identity and discourse of one particular Chinese group in Japan, the oldcomer Taiwanese. Their presence in postwar Japan is a legacy of Japanese rule in Taiwan. These Taiwanese came to Japan from colonized Taiwan as second-class Japanese citizens, and became Chinese when World War II ended. Following the lead taken by interpretive sociolinguistics, the study explicates how larger social processes enter into the construction of social identity in face-to-face interaction. The ways in which the oldcomer Taiwanese maintain, enact, and create their ethnic identity in interaction with Japanese are constrained by the special historical circumstances within which their lives have been situated. Taiwanese use different strategies in intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic interaction. In intra-ethnic social networks, their verbalized self identification tends to revolve around political ideologies while their everyday behavior might be dictated more by primordial sentiments. In inter-ethnic interaction, Taiwanese use a variety of discourse strategies to cope with exclusionary attitudes of Japanese. Many Taiwanese assert Chinese identity when they are economically successful, or when their occupations are related to Chinese culture which is appreciated by many Japanese. Other Taiwanese choose to pass as Japanese, completely or situationally. However, one's choice of this strategy largely depends on one's ability to use the Japanese language adequately. It is argued that ethnic identity is not necessarily a coherent well-bounded entity, but that it might be subject to modification according to the context. It is through the close examination of language practice that we can shed light on the fluidity of ethnic identification.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, China",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
929145874,"Tsui, Chung Man","A History of Dispossession: Governmentality and the Politics of Property in Nanjing, 1927–1979",Contemporary,"This dissertation aims to provide a history of dispossession in China from 1927 to 1979. It discusses the ways the property politics in the Nationalist and Socialist regimes have shaped the urban development of a Chinese city, Nanjing. Drawing upon the insights of Michel Foucault's governmentality studies, this dissertation tries to make sense of the shifts in relations between knowledge, power, and subjectivity in China's management of urban property, urban spaces, and urban population. The studied period from 1927 to 1979 marked the transition from sovereignty to governmentality in China. In western liberal societies, this transition was characterized by the limitation of state power and the increasing protection of individual rights. Curiously, in China, the growth and expansion of governmentality was accompanied by massive property dispossession. To examine the co-evolution of modern statehood and modern subjectivity in China, I have identified four dispossession practices adopted or invented during the studied period: eminent domain, slum clearance, socialist transformation, and communization. By studying these practices and the logic that informs them, this dissertation seeks to understand the significant shifts in how logic and objects of government are understood and acted upon, due to changing political rationality in modern China. It argues that the Chinese governmentality and the psychological, biological, sociological, and economic processes that constitute them are property-related. The control of real property has been considered by both the Nationalist Government and the Socialist Government as prerequisite to the production of governable subjects and governable spaces. This dissertation analyzes this property-based governmentality in terms of: (1) how reality of modern China was translated into governmental thoughts leading to the state monopoly of real property, and how these thoughts were rationalized. (2) how thoughts about governing real property were turned into practices, and what technologies and techniques of governments were adopted or invented to achieve these goals. (3) how the government of real property had at the same time rendered the Chinese population governable. and (4) the production of new governable spaces out of dispossession. This dissertation concludes that the Nationalist and the Socialist regimes have different political rationalities, which produced two kinds of property politics respectively: “biopolitics” and “biographic politics.” The first, “biopolitics,” concerns the politicization of biological life. Under “biopolitics,” the objective for property-government is to produce a sanitary urban environment so as to maintain the biological welfare of the population. The second one, “biographic politics,” concerns the socio-political biography of individuals. Under “biographic politics,” the objective for property-government is to remove property privileges from the people with particular biographies in the perspective of the state. Corresponding to this shift, city planning and property redistribution were employed in the two political regimes, respectively, as the main technologies of government to manage urban property, urban spaces, and the urban population.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,Architecture,Architecture,"History, Architecture, Urban planning, Architecture, China, Dispossession, Governmentality, History, Nanjing, Property",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
305030492,"Goldman, Andrea Sue","Opera in the city: Theatrical performance and urbanite aesthetics in Beijing, 1770–1900",Modern,"This study examines Chinese opera in the Qing capital, circa 1770-1900. It argues that opera in the city helped forge a widely shared urban culture. The real thrust of the project, though, lies in investigating how the stories of this common cultural repertoire came to be appropriated differently by audiences depending on class, gender, and ethnicity. This context and content approach to performance in Beijing reveals relationships between culture and power in the Qing dynasty metropolis. Through an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to theater, urban, and gender history, I locate a kind of nascent public sphere in the networks of patronage, gossip, and literati connoisseurship reflected through and generated by the opera demimonde in the capital. Discourses about power, I suggest, were often articulated through romanticized representations of gender and class in the dramatic narratives performed in the playhouses and in literati writings about performance and actors. Still, this metropolitan forum for public commentary never fully coalesced into a viable challenge to state authority. By the late nineteenth century, the Qing court had co-opted or marginalized literati resistance, thereby neutralizing the oppositional potential of the urban playhouse and its most educated patrons. This study is comprised of three parts: Part One investigates the key sources for Qing-era opera. Part Two explores the social context of opera. and Part Three analyzes the contents of one thematic grouping of scripts in light of their performance contexts. All three parts attest to the place and power of theatrical performance in Qing Beijing. Opera had the power to upset social hierarchies---making men of means and privilege feel emotionally vulnerable to status-degraded cross-dressing boy actors. it could parody social and cultural norms or it could be harnessed to the state's civilizing mission. Opera served as a kind of cultural glue---creating shared repositories of cultural knowledge (if not common cause) across differences of class, gender, and ethnicity within the Qing capital. Ultimately, the theater was a key site of public discourse in the Qing metropolis. and to the extent that it fulfilled that role in the urban community, it was also a site of competition, conflict, and controversy.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, Theater, Aesthetics, Beijing, China, Opera, Popular culture, Qing dynasty, Theatrical performance",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304315155,"Benson, Carlton",From teahouse to radio: Storytelling and the commercialization of culture in 1930s Shanghai,Contemporary,"How was popular culture used by commercial and political elites to control and mobilize ordinary urbanites in Republican China? And how was it used by ordinary urbanites to resist manipulation? This dissertation sheds light on both questions by focusing on the transformation of tanci, a popular storytelling genre, in 1930s Shanghai. Originally a popular form of entertainment that was performed in teahouses for an audience of neighborhood men, tanci became the predominant form of radio entertainment in the 1930s. With a city-wide audience that now included female as well as male listeners, the genre also became an effective medium through which entrepreneurs, politicians, and petty urbanites promoted, condemned, or negotiated the city's increasingly commercialized culture. Local entrepreneurs were early masters at manipulating the genre. They broadcast tanci to mobilize the city's residents for a new role as self-indulgent consumers, and thus promoted the birth of consumer society. The Guomindang quickly followed in the footsteps of entrepreneurs, however, and manipulated tanci to condemn consumerism and promote patriotic self-sacrifice. Thus storytelling was partly reshaped by industry and the state for an audience of consumers with less cultural authority than listeners in the traditional teahouse venue. Radio, however, was subject to the marketplace. Entrepreneurs broadcast popular programs to attract listeners, and storytelling continued to serve popular agendas. In particular, the audience employed tanci to deliver anti-commercial messages and negotiate a safe course through an emerging consumer society that generated unprecedented dangers. Listeners recognized the dehumanizing potential of consumerism and captured this threat in the concept of xurong, or vainglory. Individuals in Shanghai who were captivated by vainglory, often women, sacrificed two fundamental human qualities: qing and bao, or sensitivity and the will to reciprocate acts of kindness. Listeners also transferred their traditional appetite for derisive humor onto the radio, and identified women who practiced modern consumption as laughingstocks who inverted natural patterns of behavior. A culturally conservative audience thus created scapegoats against which to articulate a new local identity as fully human survivors in a modernizing city.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, Theater, Mass media, China, tanci",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
1441055959,"Landdeck, Kevin Paul","Under the Gun: Nationalist Military Service and Society in Wartime Sichuan, 1938-1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the state-making and citizenship projects embedded within the Nationalist (KMT) government's mobilization of men to serve in the army during World War Two. My project views wartime conscription as a fundamental break with earlier modes of recruitment, the gentry-led militarization of the late-Qing dynasty and the mercenary armies of the warlords. Nationalist authorities saw compulsory service as a tool for creating genuine citizen-soldiers and yet, while conscription was a strategic success, it proved to be a political failure. Despite the expansion of the institutional structures to extract men from their villages, conscription work was always dependent on local community elites. The result was a persistent commercialization of conscription, as men were hired as substitute draftees or literally bought and sold The draft became a stark lesson in political alienation from the government: individuals evaded. rural communities shielded their residents and preyed on outsiders. and Chongqing's densely packed urban institutions defended, sometimes violently, their human resources from the state's agents. In contrast to this political debacle, the Intellectual Youth Volunteer Movement (1943-45) was a triumph. Deracinated refugee youth - students, teachers, petty professionals and civil servants - who were already dependent on the state and ravaged by inflation, volunteered to serve in the Intellectual Youth Army. An elite force that was ironically militarily irrelevant, the Youth Army had a political mission to legitimize the Nationalist state by embodying, and publicizing themselves as, model citizens and elite soldiers. This study not only contributes to the history of the war in China, which remains only partially understood, but also to debates on Nationalist state-making and issues of political culture. It tackles the relatively neglected area of Nationalist-held interior society, rather than revolution in communist base areas or collaboration in Japanese occupied areas. It challenges the conventional narrative of wholesale disintegration in the KMT-held interior, a perspective which grew out of America's involvement in China during the war and subsequent scholarship's focus on the revolutionary growth of the Communist Party. And it offers new and nuanced perspectives on the institutional expansion of the Nationalist state, its connection to the war, and the responses (both rural and urban) to state demands. The picture that emerges is one of uneven state growth, combined with political alienation in the countryside. On the citizenship front, my project again shows a degree of vitality in the Nationalist state that has not previously been appreciated in the literature. The Youth Army and its prolific autobiographical propaganda are analyzed to uncover the socio-economic bases of volunteerism, the careful bargain struck between the state and the volunteers, and their complex self-identities as loyal citizen-soldiers. A close analysis of the political techniques to inculcate those identities and an excavation of the material object of the rifle, which stood at the center of the Youth Army's political symbology, outline the nature of Nationalist citizenship, not as a position endowed with rights but as an affirmation of the fundamental myth of the Nationalist state itself: that the state was coterminous with the people.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, China, Kuomintang, Military service, Sichuan, Sino-Japanese war, World War II",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304694494,"Kim, Kwangmin","Saintly brokers: Uyghur Muslims, trade, and the making of Qing Central Asia, 1696–1814",Modern,"This dissertation explores the dynamic of Muslim collaboration to the Qing conquest of Central Asia during the eighteenth century. By exploring the commercial nexus of empire building, this dissertation reveals the Qing empire as an early modern merchant empire, where trading interests effectively joined the colonizers and local collaborators in empire building. The Muslim collaborators were descendents of Central Asian Muslim saints and adventurers, the same ghazi (warriors of Holy War) who contributed to the rise of the Mughal and Ottoman empires. Since the fourteenth century, a faction of the Muslim adventurers ventured into Uyghuristan. Settled at this gateway to the China market, these Muslims subsequently developed a strong interest in China trade conducted within the Ming tribute system, and were increasingly drawn into close political relations with the Chinese power since the late-Ming Period. During the Qing-Zunghar war (1696-1759), the Uyghur Muslims allied themselves to the Qing side in order to participate in the wartime economic boom in the Central Asian frontier, created by the Qing army's need to purchase military supplies from local Muslims. After the Qing conquest of Muslim Xinjiang in 1759, these Muslims worked as commerce brokers for the new Qing empire, which aggressively tapped into trade as the source of its state and imperial finance. Shared, if conflicting, commercial interests in the exploitation of the overland trade as well as common concern about the resurgence of the expelled rulers of the region, the Kashgar khojas , intensified the mutual dependence of the Qing rulers and the Muslims during the Qianlong Period. Although, after the death of the Qianlong emperor, the Qing court lost its attentiveness to its possession in Xinjiang due to the decreased potential threat posed by the émigré khojas and the decline of the importance of overland trade to the imperial finance, ironically, Uyghur Muslims increasingly presented themselves as Qing subjects to local Muslims during the nineteenth century. The Muslim aristocrats, who owed their political and commercial prominence to their collaboration with the Qing, needed to emphasize their connections with the Qing, exactly when the connections became tenuous.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Central Asia, China, China-Central Asia relations, Muslims, Muslims in China, Qing dynasty, Qing history (1644--1911), Qing imperial expansion, Trade, Tribute system, Uyghurs",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
303675421,"Wasserstrom, Jeffrey Nathan","Taking it to the streets: Shanghai students and political protest, 1919-1949",Contemporary,"This dissertation contains a mixture of case studies and analytical chapters on general themes. The four case study chapters trace the role Shanghai students played in four specific youth movements that helped shape the course of the Chinese Revolution: the May 4th Movement of 1919. the May 30th Movement of 1925. the Resist Japan Movement of 1931. and the Anti-Hunger, Anti-Civil War Movement of 1947. The topics treated in the three analytic chapters are: the student protest repertoire. connections between patterns of ordinary campus life and patterns of student mobilization. and the style and content of student propaganda. The thesis concludes with a summary chapter on the symbolic aspects of Shanghai student protests, which argues that mass actions involving educated youths were potent political rituals with the power to undermine powerholders' claims to legitimacy. This thesis is different from previous works in the field in three important ways. First, many of the sources it uses--e.g. recently declassified files of the Shanghai Municipal Police and memoirs collected by the Shanghai branch of the Communist Youth League--have never before been used by Western scholars of Chinese student protest. Secondly, whereas all major monographic works on Chinese youth movements published in the West thus far have focused upon the events of a single year or at most decade, this dissertation traces continuities and discontinuities in Shanghai campus activism over the course of thirty years. Finally, while previous works have generally focused almost exclusively upon student ideology and/or the role political parties played in encouraging or suppressing campus unrest, this dissertation is most concerned with charting the social history of Shanghai youth movements and exploring the symbolic implications of student protests. To accomplish these tasks it draws upon the theoretical insights and methodological innovations of leading students of the dynamics of collective action and the significance of political rituals, such as Charles Tilly, Natalie Davis, E. P. Thompson, George Rude, Lynn Hunt, and Clifford Geertz.",1989,1989,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, China",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
303916643,"Wolff, David","To the Harbin station: City building in Russian Manchuria, 1898-1914",Contemporary,"Near the projected intersection of the Chinese Eastern Railroad and the Sungari River, Russian engineers founded the city of Harbin. During the twenty years between the survey of the site in 1897 and the profound dislocations of the 1917 revolution, Harbin grew from an abandoned distillery with a minor river portage into a bustling urban center with over 100,000 inhabitants. Harbin's size and economic importance were commensurate with its de facto role as provincial capital of Russian Manchuria. After 1917, Harbin's population was doubled by a wave of immigration, and it now became the only Russian city in the world outside of the Soviet Union. As a first step towards a Manchurian perspective on the history of the Russian Revolution, my dissertation provides an account and analysis of Harbin's rapid transformation from frontier town under government/company control to self-conscious, semi-independent community. I approach this question as a dialectic between policies created in Petersburg and the exigencies of local life in Harbin. This allows the Harbin case to speak to central historiographic concerns. Examinations of demography, administration and local politics in Russian Manchuria offer new perspectives on Russian technocracy, the Witte system, 1905 in Siberia and, most importantly, the bitter interministerial rivalries that imperiled every initiative from the center. Harbin, protected through most of its early years by distance and Finance Ministry backing, undertook a unique evolutionary path. A liberal nationality policy offered refuge to victims of persecution in Russia proper. The Jewish and Polish communities flourished. A belief that successful competition with the Chinese outweighed the dangers of ethnic particularism led both the local railway administration and its Petersburg superiors to tolerate both liberal and revolutionary political movements. The absence from Manchuria of repressive organs, such as the Gendarmerie, also furthered this development. Harbin's foreign location was often invoked to explain what within Russia could only be termed laxity. In a word, Harbin was the freest city in Russia precisely because it was outside the Empire's borders.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, China",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
303538902,"Honey, David Brian","Sinification and legitimation: Liu Yuan, Shih Le, and the founding of Han and Chao",Ancient,"The nomadic invaders of North China in the fourth century A.D. established the first conquest dynasties in China. The careers of the founders of Han and Chao, Liu Yuan and Shih Le, offer contrasting perspectives on the processes of sinification and legitimation by which they consolidated their control and confirmed their rule. Liu Yuan was the scion of the royal Hsiung-nu line that claimed consanguinity with the Han imperial house. He revived the perquisites pertaining to the office of Shan-yu, and used the historical role of this office as younger brother of the Chinese thearch in an attempt to restore the status of his people as a brother-state to China. He then adopted many of the customs of his Chinese ancestors to buttress his claim to the Chin throne as he stepped in to bring order to the sinic realm. His state-building enterprise can therefore be regarded as the effect of the process of legitimation through sinification. A counter process can be seen in the career of Shih Le, who stubbornly clung to his native customs until sinification came as an ineluctable cultural, not expedient political, process. Although utilizing similar techniques to legitimize his rule over the Chinese, his rise to power among the nomads represented the principle of tanistry, or personal prowess, not inherited birthright. This study consists of two parts. Part One, Analysis and Conclusions, includes five introductory chapters. Chapter One traces historical sino-nomadic relations until the fall of Western Chin. Chapters Two and Three discuss the concepts of sinification and legitimation. Chapters Four and Five study the individual careers of Liu Yuan and Shih Le. Part Two, The Documentary Evidence, presents annotated translations of the Chin shu biographies of Liu Yuan and Shih Le, an introductory essay on the nature of the sources, and three appendices discussing the genealogy of Liu Yuan, the names and race of Shih Le, and historical geography.",1988,1988,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, China",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304057545,"Fix, Douglas Lane",Taiwanese nationalism and its late colonial context,Contemporary,"This dissertation analyzes elite Taiwanese opposition to Japanese colonialism after 1931 in order to explore the extent of Taiwanese resistance as well as the nature of Taiwanese nationalism. A critical review of the scholarly research on the nationalist movement is given in the introduction. Chapter two examines the political reform movement promoted by the League for Local Self Rule in Taiwan during the 1930s. The new Taiwan literature movement is the subject of chapter three. In chapter four, we analyze elite Taiwanese cooperation with colonial officials during the war, including involvement in the rural revitalization campaign, the kominka movement, and Japanese propaganda efforts. Conflict over postcolonial agendas is discussed in chapter five. This study shows that organized elite resistance to Japanese colonialism continued after 1931 despite severe Japanese repression of leftist activism. The movement for local self rule articulated specific demands for Taiwanese management of local affairs, preferring political lobbying to mass mobilization in seeking its goals. Taiwanese writers created a new local literature written in vernacular Taiwanese and tied to popular culture, articulating a distinct Taiwanese identity. Wartime regimentation and assimilation policies precluded fruitful extension of either trend, but immediate postwar elite activism revitalized several aspects of Taiwanese nationalism. Finally, we have analyzed several colonial legacies that influenced postwar Chinese-Taiwanese relations: (a) networks, affiliations and modes of mass mobilization. (b) the specific demands and ideology associated with local self rule. (c) linguistic, cultural and ideological ties to Japan, which made the postwar transformation so complex. (d) local literature and written vernacular Taiwanese, which provided a basis for 1970s and 1980s literary experimentation. (e) komin literature and wartime collaboration, which remain sensitive topics. and (f) an ambivalent attitude toward a distinct Taiwanese identity.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, China",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
305030751,"Williams, John Randolph",Fraud and inquest in Jiangnan: The politics of *examination in early Qing China,Modern,"In 1711, scholars in the cities of Suzhou and Yangzhou rioted when authorities issued the roster of provincial examination winners. They were not on the list, which contained instead the names of many allegedly unqualified candidates, and their frustration was fanned by the apparent corruption stymieing their aspirations. Nervous over elite unrest in the empire's wealthiest region, the throne ordered an investigation. Instead of resolving the matter, the inquest resulted in the mutual impeachment of the region's top two administrative officials---one Han Chinese, one Manchu---which escalated the examination scandal into a regional power struggle requiring the intervention of the throne. This dissertation uses the examination scandal to explore the relationship between identity, power and bureaucratic culture in early Qing China, arguing that the consolidation of Manchu rule hinged on three intricately related processes. The first was efficient management of status distribution via civil service examination administration. The dissertation explores this process through an in-depth study of the provincial examinations, utilizing data concerning examination winners and examination administrators to analyze the tests as both administrative and political processes during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The second process was the perpetuation of a bureaucratic culture in which administrative processes like impeachment functioned to domesticate political tension between Manchu and Chinese elites. The dissertation describes this process as it functioned in Qing governance of the Yangzi Delta region in the early 18th century. Analyzing the fraud's larger political context, the dissertation argues the exam debacle to be more firmly embedded in contemporary political processes than institutional histories of the exam system have recognized. Finally, the dissertation shows how the Kangxi emperor used these processes to obstruct challenges to power from among the Manchu nobility. His management of bureaucratic process and political intrigue often resulted in the arbitrary enforcement of administrative discipline which gave his reign a reputation for corruption, but also solidified the Qing political order. As the dissertation's treatment of the exam imbroglio shows, the adjudication of corruption was an inherently political process, the discursive function of which was always legitimation of the Qing state.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, China, Civil service, Examination, Fraud, Inquest, Jiangnan, Qing dynasty",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304900454,"McNicholas, Mark Peter","Forgery and impersonation in late Imperial China: Popular appropriations of official authority, 1700–1820",Modern,"This dissertation employs two crimes—forgery of official documents and impersonation of government agents by members of the general populace—as a lens on state and society in Qing China (1644-1911). Through analysis of archival case records it introduces crimes that have gone virtually unnoticed in past scholarship. shows the imperial state's defense mechanisms and vulnerabilities. explores popular knowledge of officialdom and the dynamics of deception at the lower reaches of Chinese society. and reveals a legal and administrative order responding to socioeconomic change. The crimes occurred throughout the empire, and perpetrators came from all social and occupational strata. Common objectives were money (or silver), travel accommodations, and status or respect, and the favored devices were forged seals, official hats, and convincing stories. Impersonating an agent of the emperor or a prince was common in the Yongzheng period (1723-1735) but diminished thereafter, a change directly related to the emergence of a stable throne after the late-Kangxi (1662-1722) succession crisis. Historians have long argued that the sale of official ranks and titles hastened dynastic decline in the late Qing. Case records show this juanna (contribution) system's early importance as a mobility strategy for status-hungry lower literati and merchants—and an irresistible source of income for frauds. The activities of phony policemen reveal that local government itself, with its lower tier of privately recruited service personnel, inspired imposture and diversion of resources even in the halcyon days of administrative efficiency in the high Qing. Forgery and impersonation were perennial strategies for resource acquisition in a society marked not only by poverty and limited career prospects but also by commercialization, literacy, rapid population growth, and a porous government apparatus. By the early Ming (1368-1644) the juridical category of zhawei (deception and forgery) focused on misappropriations of state authority. Qing jurists sought to balance political and economic interpretations, reducing punishments for petty offenses but insisting on harsher penalties for flagrant violations of the statutes' political spirit.

304900664,"Rahav, Shakhar",Yun Daiying and the rise of political intellectuals in modern China: Radical societies in May Fourth Wuhan,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the formation of a radical political culture among educated youth in the central China metropolis of Wuhan during the time of the pivotal May Fourth Movement (1915-1923). The dissertation undertakes a quasi-ethnographic investigation of two cultural-political societies, the Mutual Aid Society ( Huzhu she ) and Benefit the Masses Book Society ( Liqun shushe ), that were founded by local activist Yun Daiying (1895-1931) and that presaged the local Chinese Communist Party cell. The dissertation examines the practices and activities of these societies, as well as their engagement with similar organizations in other locales and with society at large. It argues that in their everyday practices these societies cultivated a notion of the moral self which was seen as a prerequisite for national revival. The study also demonstrates how by distributing radical literature, corresponding with other activists, and meeting with them Yun's societies became centers of regional radicalism and connected local activities in Wuhan with those in other urban centers. Yun's associations thus forged regional and national networks of radicalism. The dissertation argues that, in this way May Fourth radicals constructed a political culture that was geographically expansive if socially limited. The dissertation therefore sheds light on the function of informal associations during May Fourth and suggests that their social context was no less important than ideas in the emergence of a nationwide culture of youthful radicalism and the subsequent transition to mass party politics. The dissertation contributes to the historiography of May Fourth in both methodology and geographical scope. Current historiography of May Fourth focuses on the ideological development of intellectuals, and for the most part concentrates on the centers of Beijing and Shanghai. By contrast, the dissertation undertakes a social history of May Fourth intellectuals in a hinterland city. By examining the ways in which May Fourth cultural-political associations operated, the dissertation illuminates the role of sociability within the dynamics of ideas and revolution in China. At the same time, the dissertation contributes to the historical sociology of intellectuals, a field that has been theorized largely from European experience.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, China, Intellectuals, May Fourth Movement, Sociology of knowledge, Wuhan, Yun Daiying",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304683129,"Kiely, Jan Francis","Making good citizens: The reformation of prisoners in China's first modern prisons, 1907–1937",Contemporary,"In the first decade of the twentieth century, the Qing state abandoned its long-standing highly ritualized beatings, banishments and executions in favor of a Western penal model of punishment based on incarceration and its purported aim of rehabilitating convicts. The penal reforms of this era initiated a process of interactions between theory, policy and social practice that brought about a radical transformation not only in the manner in which crime was perceived and punished in China, but also in contributing centrally to the establishment of the means and the mentalities of the modern Chinese state's project of transforming the minds of the people to make new citizens mobilized for the nation and state-directed social transformation. Though focused primarily on the programs of moral instruction and education in the first Jiangsu and Beijing modern prisons prior to 1937, this study takes as its subject ganhua or reformation—the central principle and purpose of the modern Chinese prisons. Though an emanation of an international trend, penal reformation evolved in China amidst complex interactions between received assumptions and mentalities, new theory, competing discourses, specific codes, regulations, plans and policies and much untidy human practice carried forth in language and cultural expression distinctly Chinese. Not only was this form of transformative practice shaped with specific cultural formulas circulating in society, but it involved a wide range of contributors working within and beyond the state. Confucian-nationalist public moralists, Pure Land Buddhist lay devotee elites and clergy, academic social scientists and political party ideologues all would contribute to penal reform and the promotion of penal reformation as a means to disseminating their own visions of national and human salvation. Hence these transformative mechanisms of modern state power were formed, sustained, expanded and given meaning in relation to particular cultural structures and social practices.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, China, Prisoners, Prisons, Reformation, State indoctrination",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
305030778,"Lee, Seung-joon","National rice vs. foreign rice: Food, culture, and politics in modern Canton, 1900–1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines how the food supply of Canton was profoundly transformed within the context of global grain commercialization and the rise of nationalism in the early twentieth century. By exploring cross-border characteristics of the food supply of Canton---whose rice trade networks were more closely linked with the Southeast Asian rice markets than with the domestic grain trade of the Chinese hinterlands---I argue that the Chinese modern state's attempts to recast these transnational rice trade networks into a national framework was doomed to failure because government policy-makers were only concerned with statistical analysis, the precision of rice quantity measurement, and administrative efficiency. Unlike past scholarship that has favored quantitative methodologies, my research explores qualitative dimensions of foodstuff. specifically rice quality, dietary preferences, and local food culture. In early-twentieth-century Canton, the residents strongly preferred foreign rice, originally imported from Southeast Asia via Hong Kong. Canton residents became accustomed to the superior quality of foreign rice as compared to inferior domestic rice shipped from the northern hinterlands of China---especially, Anhui and Hunan provinces. Taking the point-of-view of the rice-consuming public, my research traces the formation of the local dietary preferences and food culture of Canton within a historical context. The scope of this research is not limited to a strictly local focus, however. I consider local rice consumption in Canton and the transnational rice trade centered in Hong Kong together, thereby challenging the nation as the fundamental unit of historical analysis. In the eyes of the Guomindang Nationalists, the increasing consumption of foreign rice by the Cantonese was nothing but a waste of national wealth and an insult to China's agricultural economy. Policy-makers in Nanjing and a number of scientists and social scientists---mostly trained in western universities in fields of science and engineering---never seriously considered the local particularities of Cantonese food culture or the variations in rice qualities. Hence, they could not realize the significance of rice quality in the market because this was not measurable in their quantitative knowledge. As this government policy monolithically treated all rice as a calculable object of social engineering program, local dietary preferences and particular consumer demand for higher-quality foreign rice became overlooked. Consequently, national rice supported by the central government was unable to match the brand popularity of foreign rice in the Canton rice market, and the coercive rice control policy that the government obstinately executed caused an unprecedented rice crisis in Canton in 1936 and 1937. What blinded government policy-makers, I contend, has to be found in the inner logic of the modern social-engineering program and scientific knowledge, whose fundamental rationale was bureaucratic efficiency.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Cultural anthropology, Public administration, Canton, China, Culture, Food, Politics, Rice",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
305338501,"Mostern, Ruth A.","Apprehending the realm: Territoriality and political power in Song China, 960–1276 CE",Medieval,"This project concerns political geography during imperial China's Song era. During the three hundred-some years of the Song regime, there were over a thousand occasions when counties or prefectures were created or abolished, or when counties were moved from the jurisdiction of one prefecture to another. These clustered in three periods of renovation, each associated with particular policy imperatives. The first period of territorial change was at the beginning of the dynasty. Politically, authority was held on a new footing, and administrative geography is one place that the new arrangement was revealed. Territories increased in number in the north and in the southwest, and were reduced drastically in the southeast. The second period of territorial change was approximately one century after the founding of the dynasty. Faced with military defeat, dreaming of frontier expansion, and managing fiscal crisis, reformers at court pushed for major changes in the organization of administrative geography. During two generations of reform, reaction, and counter-reaction, territories increased dramatically in number on the military and settlement frontiers of the northwest and southwest, and were slashed throughout the heartland of the empire. The third period of territorial change began with the invasion of the capital and the fall of the north, and continued as the regime was reconstituted in the south. During this generation of change, the number of territories remained stable, but they cycled in and out of existence rapidly, dictated by the movements of troops and refugees, and new territories were created throughout the tax-bearing hinterlands of the south. The production of maps, surveys, and documents describing the terrain and its attributes was a feature of each period of territorial change. This dissertation reveals that the manipulation of political territory was a way for the Song court, attempting to run a bureaucratic empire with limited resources and pre-modern communication, to govern its hinterland by balancing the need to extract tax revenue from all of its subjects with the desire to limit the costs of its field administration. It reveals, further, the mechanics by which the frontier was made into manageable civil space.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Geography, China, Colonialism, Political power, Song dynasty, Territoriality",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States

This study of Chinese workers adds to the scholarship on social mobilization that brought about the Chinese revolution, a scholarship that has previously focused on the peasantry. The thesis addresses how the Nationalists lost their urban and predominantly military social base and how the Communists, as a primarily urban clandestine force, mobilized support in Chongqing, the wartime capital of the Nationalist government. Based on archives of the Nationalist defense industry, records of the American War Production Mission in China, and interviews with former arsenal employees, this dissertation examines the process of industrial development, social transformation, and labor activism within the Chongqing arms industry. In contrast to recent labor studies of China, which have underscored class fragmentation, this thesis argues that class formation was both a historical process, whereby arsenal workers entered a wage relationship subordinate to state capitalism, and a project whereby a militant minority of activists organized workers and articulated an alternative politics. After analyzing the wartime buildup of Chongqing's arms industry, an examination of arsenal workers' social origins, material conditions, organizations, and political activities underscores the often conflictual relationship between workers and management This class dynamic underlay the attitudes of labor and propelled management to adopt elaborate social welfare policies and authoritarian methods. As the arms industry represented a pillar of the Nationalists' military and state power, the significance of this thesis lies in showing how arsenal workers became alienated from factory officials, a stratum of the military elite, and thus contributed to the general collapse of state legitimacy. Workers and Communists held separate but often intersecting interests during the War of Resistance and the post-war labor movement. The conclusion suggests that the concerted actions, grievances, and aspirations of arsenal workers during the war period would converge with the Communist program and class-based political movements of the early 1950s.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Labor relations, International law, International relations, Arsenals, China, Chongqing, Japan, Labor, Nationalist, War of resistance, Workers",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
861631275,"Zhang, Zhaoyang",Civil Laws and Civil Justice in Early China,Ancient,"Civil laws and civil justice in early China have not received sufficient scholarly attention, because scholars tend to assume that laws in pre-modern China were merely criminal laws promulgated and enforced to maintain public order. This dissertation challenges that view by analyzing excavated evidence and reexamining transmitted evidence. Chapter One establishes the existence of civil laws in early China by examining noncriminal case reports preserved in the Juyan strips and by assessing the role of district bailiffs in handling civil disputes. Chapter Two further demonstrates the existence of civil laws and reveals the civil justice system by studying domestic statutes and how two cases of inheritance disputes preserved in the Comprehensive Discussion of Customs ( Fengsu tongyi , comp. ca. 200) illustrate the application of these statutes. Chapter Three examines two important civil legal concepts: zhi (a straight account of the facts) and mingfen (title and portion) to reveal the underlining notions that uniformly guided the application of the civil laws. Chapter Four, the concluding chapter, goes beyond the boundaries of civil laws to address larger issues, such as the legal ideal of reforming people's morals to reduce lawsuits, the relationship between rituals and laws, and the Classics as a source of legal authority in litigations.

304496233,"Fraser, David Embrey","Smoking out the enemy: The National Goods Movement and the advertising of nationalism in China, 1880–1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the relationship between nationalism and commercialization in early 20th century China through the lenses of commodity consumption and pictorial advertising. Its focus is the commodification of nationalism as a set of strategies by entrepreneurs and officials to unite politics and economics in the cause of national salvation and profits. The study, centered on the Shanghai business community and middle class, probes how leaders of the National Goods Movement (Guohuo yundong) used goods to sell nationalism, and nationalism to sell goods. Drawing on late Qing reformist notions of “commercial warfare” as a substitute for military resistance to foreign aggression, the dissertation engages political, economic, social, and cultural issues by tracing how theorists of the early Republic reconfigured earlier ideas about the role of commodities in China's quest for wealth and power. Unlike most historical studies of the era, this one highlights consumers and consumption, focusing on mass-produced “daily commodities” as key elements in Shanghai's cosmopolitan culture. These are placed in the context of guohuo (national goods) institution building, notably commercial exhibitions of Chinese products. bourgeois social mobility. and Guomindang nationbuilding. A separate chapter probes the unconventional marketing methods of a conventionally structured firm, Huacheng Tobacco, which sold elite lifestyle rather than the moralistic patriotism characteristic of guohuo ideology. Themes from chapters focusing on theory, institutions, and the corporate world are reprised in the final chapter, which discusses a critical 1928 essay on Chinese advertising theory, and then analyzes two series of pictorial advertisements in a historically grounded, symbolic reading. The discussion centers on the gendering of advertisements as an aesthetic commercial device, amid elite ambivalence about the shifting social roles of women. A brief conclusion proposes advertising as a visual vernacular that gave meaning to these newly available commodities, and suggests that the hints of a culturally based, commodified civic consciousness may be seen in the broadening of relations between people and their purchases. The efforts of guohuo, leaders to channel urban consumption toward patriotic purchase, however, faltered as Shanghai's cosmopolitan consumers bought what they wanted to enhance their own lives.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Marketing, Advertising, China, National Goods Movement, Nationalism",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304245290,"Reed, Christopher Alexander","Gutenberg in Shanghai: Mechanized printing, modern publishing, and their effects on the city, 1876-1937",Contemporary,"In the historiography of China, social or intellectual change is frequently traced to an educational institution. Christopher A. Reed's Gutenberg in Shanghai: Mechanized Printing, Modern Publishing, and Their Impact on the City, 1876 to 1937 traces the emergence of Shanghai as an intellectual center to its business and industrial institutions. Initially a dispersed and disorganized industry offering employment to refugees and orphans, by the 1930s, Shanghai's Chinese-language book publishing sector dominated both a central district of treaty-port Shanghai and the national market for modern publications. From the heart of Shanghai, modern Chinese publishers displaced older publishing centers and came to influence national agendas in educational and intellectual life. In these six decades, how did Shanghai's modern Chinese publishers foster conditions that made this city a national center of cultural life? The development of this cultural industry, a process which was by no means inevitable, is narrated and analyzed by looking at its four main features: (1) its claim, both commercial and intellectual, on the late imperial national book market. (2) Shanghai's lithographic publishing system, the necessary bridge from small-scale artisanal printing and publishing to modern industrial book production. (3) the evolution of the corporate publishing company system and its editorial processes. and, (4) the emergence of the factory system that supplied the industry with locally-produced machinery and printers. The successful adaptation of Western technology and business forms to radical new Chinese book publishing goals are shown to have enabled public-spirited entrepreneurs and intellectuals to use this industry to achieve prominence within Shanghai, as well as beyond its borders. Building on the theme of mechanization in this pivotal cultural industry, the dissertation provides a new perspective on the history of late nineteenth and early twentieth century Shanghai as well as on its intellectual and cultural worlds. Through an assessment of the impact of the modern industrial world on the ancient Chinese world of texts and editorship, Shanghai appears as a site of cultural history, but with the emphasis on the entrepreneurial and vocational side of that history.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Mass media, China",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
861631360,"Hang, Xing","Between Trade and Legitimacy, Maritime and Continent: The Zheng Organization in Seventeenth-Century East Asia",Modern,"This study examines the Zheng organization, which flourished from 1625 to 1683, during a time when the Ming-Qing transition in China intersected with the formation of an integrated early modern economy in maritime Asia. This quasi-governmental commercial enterprise reached the apex of its power under Zheng Chenggong (1624-1662), and his son and successor Zheng Jing (1642-1681). From bases along the southeastern Chinese coast and Taiwan, they relied upon overseas commerce to maintain a sustained resistance against the Manchus, who had taken over most of China in 1644 from the collapsing Ming, the ethnic Chinese dynasty to which both men had pledged their support. Like their fiercest competitor, the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the organization protected the safety and property of Chinese subjects abroad, engaged in armed trade, and aggressively promoted overseas expansion. Zheng Chenggong and Jing proved far more successful and profitable at these endeavors than the VOC. In 1662, shortly before his death, Chenggong even defeated and expelled the company from its colony of Taiwan, and opened the island for Chinese colonization and settlement. Yet, operating within an imperial world order that looked upon overseas contact of any form as a potential source of political instability, the Zhengs, lacking “native” maritime sources of legitimacy, had to receive recognition for their authority from continental centers of power. Father and son skillfully utilized the ranks and titles from the Ming Yongli pretender to rule over territory, develop a civil bureaucracy, and sign treaties with foreign powers, functioning essentially as an autonomous “state.” Moreover, by successfully intermediating between continental and maritime Chinese cultural discourse, they forged a complex social unit of traders, militarists, and Ming imperial descendants and loyalist elites. However, this ambiguous arrangement, which gave the organization maximum autonomy and flexibility, came under threat due to the gradual consolidation of Qing rule. Chenggong’s successor, Zheng Jing, turned away from Ming symbols of authority on Taiwan during the 1660s, and tried to institutionalize a new identity based upon Han Chinese customs and Confucian moral values on an island considered by contemporaries to be geographically and culturally outside of “China.” In negotiations with the Qing court, he pressed hard for the emperor to recognize Taiwan as a tributary kingdom along the lines of Korea. The talks broke down, however, over ethnic identity, as Zheng insisted upon keeping his Han Chinese long hair and flowing robes, while the Qing ruler ordered him to shave his head and wear tight riding jackets in the Manchu style. Despite the failure of negotiations, Zheng took significant steps toward articulating a distinct Han Chinese state. He traded extensively, signed a commercial treaty with the English East Indies Company, and nearly launched an invasion of the Spanish Philippines. However, his return to China to participate in the Rebellion of the Three Feudatories (1674-1681) ruined his organization and paved the way for the Qing invasion and occupation of Taiwan in 1683, two years after his death. This project moves beyond the standard Confucian trope of the Zhengs as ardent Ming loyalists or the Western narrative of ruthless pirate entrepreneurs, extreme discourses later appropriated to serve different nationalisms. Instead, the two men should be viewed as both the initiators and products of a dynamic and internally generated East Asian modernity within an interdependent economic and cultural region that nonetheless enjoyed significant interactions outside the system. Such an approach imbues maritime China with agency and revises the role commonly attributed to it as a marginalized appendage of its bureaucratic and agrarian continental counterpart. An examination of interstate relations unique to this East Asian world region also allows one to conceive of communities beyond the nation-state, and make sense of their identity formation and change, especially when combined with shifts in spatial settings.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,History,History,"History, Military history, China, Dutch East India Company, Koxinga, Maritime, VOC, Zheng Chenggong, Zheng Jing, Zheng organization",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304845426,"Kingsberg, Miriam Lynn","The poppy and the acacia: Opium and imperialism in Japanese Dairen and the Kwantung Leased Territory, 1905–1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the “opium problem” of Dairen and the Kwantung Leased Territory (KLT) throughout the period of Japanese control (1905-1945). By the late 1920s Dairen, a port city on the south Manchurian coast, manifested the world's highest per-capita rate of opiate consumption, and the second-largest volume of trafficking. The enormous drug market served as the basis for an imperial discourse on opium as a social problem: the ahen mondai . Contributors positioned opium as both the cause and consequence of Chinese inferiority and sovereign unfitness. Abstinence from narcotics, by contrast, indicated Japanese superiority and justified expansionism on the Asian mainland. This analysis exposes the gap between the Japanese presentation of opium and its social realities, probing the consequences of the opium market from the perspective of drug users, dealers, and doctors. These collective participants engaged with opium for one or more of the following purposes: to secure economic well-being, increase professional standing, and improve their position within Japan's racial hierarchy. The Japanese regime (Kantô Totokufu/Kantô-chô), which was financially dependent on both the legal and illegal opium traffic, sanctioned these objectives to increase its power over society and its political rivals, particularly the South Manchurian Railway Company. In providing payoffs to all parties, the narcotic economy drew elites and subalterns alike into new communities of interest, blurring distinctions between “collaboration” and “resistance” and eliciting a political stability and quiescence unparalleled within the Japanese empire. The primary contribution of this study is highlighting the importance of opium to social management, military encroachment, and imperial legitimacy in Manchuria. In contrast to existing histories of opium in East Asia, which approach narcotics as a topic of top-down politico-economic history, this bottom-up analysis increases our understanding of the experience of the subject. I call attention to experiments in policy and ideology of the pre-1932 era of Japanese expansion, generally overlooked by scholars in their focus on Manchukuo. Beyond these regional considerations, my investigation of drugs, commodities that traverse and transgress all national boundaries, integrates the study of the Japanese empire, now a specialized topic, into the larger history of the early twentieth-century world.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,History,History,"History, Modern history, Addiction, China, Dairen, Drugs, Empire, Imperialism, Japanese, Kwantung Leased Territory, Manchuria, Opium",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304077155,"Guo, Qitao",Huizhou Mulian operas: Conveying Confucian ethics with demons and gods,Modern,"Mulian Rescues his Mother: An Opera for Goodness, composed in the late sixteenth century by Zheng Zhizhen, a Confucian scholar from the famous prefecture of Huizhou, marked a new tradition of Mulian performance. Different from previous Buddhist Mulian literature, this first full-sized Mulian script features a comprehensive ethicoreligious discourse, conveying Confucian ethics with the demons and gods of the syncretized Three Teachings and folk religion. Later Mulian scripts, like the Boyang and Changbiao versions from the Huizhou region, further popularized and expanded this new Mulian tradition. Zheng Zhizhen's Mulian reflected the new sociocultural trends of the time, which were especially manifest in Huizhou. Huizhou, the ancestral place of the great Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi, was a center of orthodox ideology in Ming-Qing times. The late Ming witnessed a great strengthening of Huizhou lineage culture, featuring the establishment of corporate lands and lineage temples, the elaboration of ancestral rites, and the promotion of the cult of female marital fidelity. Closely connected with their ancestral lineages and armed with a new Confucian mercantile ethic, a powerful group of Huizhou merchants rose in late Ming. At about the same time the region became a center of ritual-operatic performance. Partly due to the influence of Buddhist Mt. Jiuhua and Taoist Mt. Qiyun located in the region, Huizhou lineage culture was also colored with belief in supernatural beings. Huizhou Mulian was firmly anchored in the lineage, and was not only popular but widely shared. Supported by lineage elites (including merchants) and watched by vast number of kinsmen and kinswomen, it enacted Huizhou lineage culture under the heavy influence of commercial development. Through exhortation or punishment, carried out by supernatural powers, Huizhou Mulian conveyed through performed images new sociocultural values. For example, Mulian represented filial piety, Miss Cao and later the Hanged Woman female chastity, Fu Xiang the benevolence of a lineage head and the syncretic tendency of a Confucian scholar, Yili loyal servanthood, the five bandits (later deified as the demonic god Wuchang) a warning against avarice, Madame Liu punishment of disloyal widowhood.

304900416,"Nakajima, Seio","The Chinese film industry in the Reform era: Its genesis, structure, and transformation since 1978",Contemporary,"Studies of Chinese media including the film industry are divided into two approaches. The market control view emphasizes the laissez-faire notions of free markets and predicts the declining role of the state and politics. The state control view stresses the continuing role of the state and argues that politics is trumping the development of market mechanisms. This dissertation proposes an alternative to these two views by relying on the perspective of economic sociology, which argues that the market cannot be disembedded from social institutions including politics and culture. By closely examining the emergence, stabilization, and transformation of the Chinese film industry in the Reform era since 1978, I argue that film markets with distinctive social structures are being created by the interaction of the three logics of filmmaking based on political legitimacy, economic viability, and artistic autonomy. The findings show the limits of the state-versus-market framework and call for a more sociological approach to market phenomena, which focuses on the co-evolution of political, economic, and artistic logics in the market transition of a cultural industry. In sociology of culture, this dissertation tackles the question of how to analyze the relationship between the meanings and characteristics of cultural products and the industrial system and organization of production, distribution, and exhibition. I argue that the relation between the nature of cultural products and the industrial system is mediated by the changing, but continuing existence of censorship and restrictions on certain types of films as well as positive sanctions on the production of politically-legitimate films (what is called main-melody films or political propaganda films). I analyze how the interaction between different types of film text and the industrial context results in such distinctive organizational strategies as product diversification (i.e., produce political films to secure political legitimacy, commercial films to ensure economic viability, and art-house films to claim artistic autonomy) and product specialization (i.e., rely on the subsidies provided by the state for the production of political films in order to survive the increasingly competitive market environment in the Reform era).",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Organizational behavior, Organization theory, Motion pictures, China, Film industry, Reform era",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304901840,"Kaufman, Alison Adcock",One nation among many: Foreign models in the constitutional thought of Liang Qichao,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the constitutional thought of Liang Qichao between 1898 and 1907, focusing on the role his exploration of foreign political systems and political theories—of the United States, Russia, and Japan—played in the development of his political thought. The first part of the dissertation delves into the intellectual basis of Liang Qichao's political writings. I contextualize Liang's constitutional thought against the backdrop of Chinese constitutional movements and the intellectual influences that fed into Chinese constitutionalism. These included neo-Confucianism, Spencerianism, Anglo-American classical liberal constitutionalism, German-Continental statist constitutionalism, and Japanese constitutionalism. I go on to examine the development of two concepts central to Liang's political thought, ziyou (freedom) and quan (rights or powers). I argue that the close relationship Liang Qichao draws between rights and power is central to his understanding of how a people becomes politically modern. I note also that he views political modernization as simultaneously a psychological process, growing out of a people's consciousness of itself as a citizenry with rights and freedoms, and an institutional one, wherein the political structures of a constitutional, competitive party system help to create this consciousness. I then turn to Liang's analyses of three nations to understand how his prescriptions for political reform were affected by their example. America's democracy, Russia's revolutionary struggles, and Japanese constitutional practice helped crystallize his thinking about the most appropriate path for China. While he increasingly came to believe in the importance of strong political leadership and robust political institutions, I argue that his focus remained on the capabilities and rights of the people and on the creation of a competitive, constitutional state. Finally, this dissertation addresses two critiques of Liang's thought. First, I suggest that attempts to assess Liang's liberalism too often depict western constitutional liberalism as a monolithic entity with a single set of core concepts, and overlooking the prominence of constitutionalism in 19 th century liberal thought. Second, I focus analysis of Liang's thought away from his changing preference for certain governmental arrangements—monarchy vs. republic—and toward the underlying concepts that drove his political prescriptions.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Political science, China, Constitutionalism, Liang, Qichao, Qing dynasty",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304749479,"Xu, Yamin","Wicked citizens and the social origins of China's modern authoritarian state: Civil strife and political control in Republican Beiping, 1928–1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the social origins of the Chinese Nationalist authoritarian state. it argues that the rise of the Nationalist authoritarian state in the 1920s and 1930s was a response to an urgent need to control an increasingly disordered Chinese society. With the Manchus' livelihood gradually becoming bankrupted, socioeconomic and demographic conditions continually deteriorated and pushed the majority of Beiping residents into a poverty-stricken status in the early twentieth century. As the struggle for survival by ordinary citizens intensified, and with basic civility being disregarded, the situation created a host of what state authorities denounced as “wicked people”—ordinary citizens turned bandits, thieves, quacks, con-artists, wife-beaters, litterbugs, and street corner urinators. Their rampant activities created tremendous tension and uncertainty in already deeply pauperized families and neighborhoods, which prompted a vigorous response from the state, whose goal was to save a society that was on the brink of total collapse. With the fall of the Qing dynasty, previously segregated neighborhoods were opened up, more heterogeneous immigrants flooded into the city, market activities increased, and families fragmented. As ethnic, familial and native-tie based urban identities became less pronounced, traditional particularistic orders further disintegrated. These developments fundamentally changed the character of Beiping urban society. To meet these changes, a new municipal authority was called upon to manage and regulate city life, particularly in areas such as public security and public health. Constrained by financial resources and a hostile social environment, the Beiping municipal government was poorly equipped, and its police force and public-health inspectors heavily burdened. Reflecting a desperate struggle to increase the government effectiveness to control both society and state agents, the Nationalists stressed group organizations, militarization of society, discipline, social conformity, and harsh punishment. While the Nationalist efforts ultimately proved ineffective, they presaged new and more comprehensive approaches to state building and state control in the People's Republic under the Communists and post-Communist reformers. In that sense, the imposition of state control under the socialist regime after 1949 was not such a sharp break with the past. but rather a continuation of trends that began much earlier with the Nationalists themselves.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Public administration, Social structure, Authoritarian, Beiping, China, Civil strife, Political control, Social origins, Wicked citizens",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
507894815,"Liu, Wennan","No smoking for the nation: Anti-cigarette campaigns in modern China, 1910–1935",Contemporary,"In a gray zone between recreational consumption and drug addiction, cigarette smoking was never officially outlawed, but sporadically condemned in anti-cigarette campaigns launched by social organizations and the government in modern China. Why and how did these campaigns occur in China when no definite evidence could prove that cigarette smoking impairs health? This dissertation investigates the rhetoric, practices, and contexts of three major anti-cigarette campaigns in modern China from 1910 to 1935. Chapter One examines how Edward Thwing, an American missionary, transplanted the American anti-cigarette campaign to the Chinese context and initiated a similar campaign in Tianjin in 1910. Chapter Two explores the anti-cigarette campaign led by Wu Tingfang, a retired Qing official, and the Shanghai social elite in the active public arena in Shanghai on the eve of the Revolution in 1911. Chapters Three and Four scrutinize the anti-cigarette campaign as a part of the New Life Movement launched by Chiang Kai-shek in 1934-1935. Chapter Three examines how the central New Life Movement designed and implemented the anti-cigarette agenda, which faced resistance within the government because cigarettes were a major source of tax income. With a local perspective, Chapter Four shows how the provincial and county governments in Zhejiang combined the central anti-cigarette agenda with the local initiative to save the rural economy and campaigned actively at the county level. The three campaigns illustrate that the anti-cigarette agenda was embedded in more significant social political themes such as cultivating qualified citizens, saving the national and local economy, and establishing new public etiquettes. The anti-cigarette rhetoric connected the personal action of smoking with the fate of the nation, and thus persuaded individuals to give up smoking for the benefit of the nation. In this sense, the anti-cigarette campaigns also demonstrate the mechanism of informal social control in modern China. The weakness of these campaigns lay not in the rhetoric but in the implementation in which the civil society and the government lacked cooperation.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Public health, Antismoking, China, Social control, Thwing, Edward, Tobacco, Wu, Tingfang",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
251727629,"Menegon, Eugenio","Ancestors, virgins, and friars: The localization of Christianity in Late Imperial Mindong (Fujian, China), 1632–1863",Modern,"Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Chinese Catholic converts localized Christianity in their communities. This process involved the appropriation of Catholic ritual and devotional elements. Owing to their rich archival records, as well as to their uninterrupted history of almost four centuries, Catholic communities in Mindong (north-eastern Fujian province) offer an outstanding example of this localization. In localizing their new, religion, Mindong converts negotiated Catholic practices and beliefs with native socio-religious customs and state policies of ideological control. By employing sources of cultural legitimization existing in the local religious arena, and by relying on kinship networks, Mindong Christians successfully carved out a niche for their activities in their communities. Furthermore, in accepting the reform of ancestral rituals and novel ideas such as the virginity of consecrated women, they expanded the boundaries of local religious tolerance. These findings indicate that Christianity in Mindong became part of an existing pluralistic religious field shared by other officially proscribed religious movements such as lay Buddhist groups. Thus, by privileging the local perspective instead of accepting the usual viewpoint of the central officialdom and high elites, this dissertation shows that the extent of late imperial society's tolerance for “heterodoxy” was wider than previous scholarship has allowed.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Religious history, Womens studies, Folklore, China, Christianity, Fujian, Imperial, Localization, Mindong, Virgins",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States

I aim to reveal connections between the colonial past and socialist present. I also aim to reveal both the idiosyncrasies of Japanese colonialism vis-à-vis Western colonialism from the perspective of the built environment, and the similarities and connections of urban construction between the colonial and socialist regime, despite antithetically propagandist banners, to unfold the shared value of anti-capitalist pursuit of exploring new visions of and different paths to the modern. The first three chapters relate to colonial period (1932-1945), each exploring one facet of the idiosyncrasies of Japanese colonialism in relation to Changchun's urbanism. Chapter One deals with the idiosyncrasies of Japanese colonialism as manifested in planning Changchun are the subject of the next chapter. Chapter Two charts out the plurality of architectural styles in the city, and analyzes the diversities, ambivalences, and ambiguities in the practice of statecraft and urban construction. Chapter Three gives a picture of how the downtown of Changchun was reconstructed to meet new political agenda when Socialist Realism took sway of aesthetic program. I also examine in this chapter the nature of Japanese colonialism in Manchukuo from the perspective of rituals and pubic pageantries, by using Yamamuro's analogy of the client state to a hybrid beast of chimera.

304899979,"King, Michelle Tien",Drowning daughters: A cultural history of female infanticide in late nineteenth century China,Contemporary,"This study historicizes the practice of female infanticide in China, comparing writings from Chinese and Western observers in the late nineteenth century. It is centered on the Jiangnan region in the period before and after the Taiping Rebellion [1851-64]. While female infanticide was an object of cultural authority for Western commentators of the time, who bolstered competing claims of expert knowledge on the subject of China writ large, it was an object of moral authority for Chinese writers, for whom it stood as but one of many social behaviors inscribed into a system of cosmic rewards and retributions. By the early twentieth century, the preeminence of moral authority in the Chinese context gave way to scientific authority, as the discourse against infanticide was rewritten into a new context of population science, eugenics, and women's rights. The two main protagonists are Gabriel Palatre [1830-78], a French Jesuit missionary based in Shanghai, and Yu Zhi [1809-74], a Chinese schoolteacher from the nearby town of Wuxi. Chapter 1 analyzes the narrative strategies used in Western debates over the prevalence of Chinese infanticide through the nineteenth century. Chapter 2 examines nineteenth century Chinese didactic writings, which placed the practice of infanticide into a context of moral authority, involving a relational network that extended beyond the mother and father, to include the midwife, mother-in-law, female neighbors, and even village scholars. Chapter 3 dissects Gabriel Palatre's study of Chinese infanticide, which categorized Chinese texts under French rubrics, reducing them to atomized pictures and texts, divorced from any moral vector. Chapter 4 explores the embodiment of moral authority through the life and work of Yu Zhi, who favored oral expressive forms of village lectures and operatic plays for the cultivation of moral values. Chapter 5 considers the various life options that faced girls rescued from infanticide, who could be placed as child brides, sent to an orphanage, or raised in their own families with the support of a native charitable society. Ultimately, the incommensurability of Chinese and Western alternatives for rescued infants was profoundly exposed with the Tianjin Massacre of 1870.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, China, Cultural history, Daughters, Female infanticide, Infanticide, Nineteenth century",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
304432453,"Theiss, Janet Mary",Dealing with disgrace: The negotiation of female virtue in eighteenth-century China,Modern,"This dissertation examines how norms of female chastity and virtuous behavior for women worked in social practice in eighteenth-century China. The focus of analysis is central court cases from the Qianlong reign (1736-95) involving conflicts over violations of female chastity through rape, assault, or harassment, and women's transgression of orthodox norms through insubordination, remarriage, and adultery. Chapter one re-examines the significance of the institutionalization of the cult of female chastity and the emergence of a querelles des femmes during the High Qing era, considering the political, economic and cultural circumstances which gave female virtue unprecedented relevance and popularity. Chapter two describes how state, descent group, community and family structures of authority intersected to form local moral communities for the transmission, interpretation and enforcement of ethical norms for women. It analyzes the critical role of reputation in the dynamics of communal conflict over moral issues. Chapter three explores the moral significance of the distinction between the inner and the outer in its multiple forms: as the differentiation between family and public space and activities proper to women and men. as the bodily boundary of chastity which is violated in sexual assault or illicit sex. and as categories of etiquette which define propriety in words and gestures exchanged between women and men. Chapter four analyzes cultural constructions of immoral and chaste women and their social significance for reputation. It demonstrates the use of moral idioms as weapons of character defamation or self-justification in conflicts in the courtroom and in social practice. Orthodox norms of chastity were indeed accepted as integral to reputation, personal integrity and social order in the family and local communities by women and men across the diverse regions of China. However, in the adjudication of gender-based conflicts and crimes, when judicial officials upholding state orthodoxy interpreted ethical norms and the implications of their abrogation, the fluidity and even relativity of norms in practice becomes clear. The hegemonic effectiveness and resilience of these norms was due largely to their malleability which allowed people to negotiate, interpret and adapt them within certain parameters to suit their own circumstances and priorities.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, China, Disgrace, Eighteenth century, Virtue, Women",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
896622085,"Chou, Wen-Shing Lucia",The Visionary Landscape of Wutai Shan in Tibetan Buddhism from the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Century,Modern,"The sacred mountain range of Wutai Shan (known in Tibetan as Riwo Tsegna) on the northern frontier of China offers a unique site for examining the religious culture of the Qing empire. Not only did it become one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Tibetans and Mongolians, it is also the location where Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist cosmographies converged. While surviving texts and images of Wutai Shan from medieval China have attracted considerable scholarly attention, artistic and literary representations of the mountain range in the later periods have rarely been studied. Drawing on a panoply of textual, pictorial, and architectural sources from Qing dynasty (1644-1912) onward, this dissertation explores the shifting dynamics of this holy site as a geographical, visual, and visionary destination in Tibetan Buddhism. Primary objects of my analysis include pilgrims' maps, mural programs that include Wutai Shan, praise poems, travel narratives and guidebooks, as well as sculptural and architectural replicas of the mountain range by Tibetan Buddhists in Tibet, Mongolia, the Manchu court in Beijing, and at Wutai Shan itself. Each chapter coheres around individual(s) responsible for producing knowledge about Wutai Shan. Taken together, these case studies reveal the building blocks of Wutai Shan's visionary landscape: the discourse of visionary encounters, memories of previous masters, rituals, travel, and cosmography. I show that representations of these seemingly ephemeral or intangible histories, concepts, and experiences constitute the core of the mountain's religious identity, defining the ways Wutai Shan came to be viewed in the Tibetan Buddhist world with a potency and persistence that outstrips its physical topography and material structure or holdings.

It documents the organizational strategies the Chinese Communist Party used to mobilize professional expertise after the 1949 Revolution and the consequences of their implementation on state and society. Using historical evidence, contemporary interviews, and a theoretical framework based on Antonio Gramsci's idea of hegemony and Emile Durkheim's work on occupational solidarity, this dissertation analyzes the situation of secondary school teachers in Shanghai from 1949 through 1968. It concludes that post-revolution changes in the professional workplace, specifically in staff composition, division of labor, compensation schedules, and disciplinary practices, engendered a multitude of workplace conflicts and a heightened sense of political resentment among professional workers. Like other Marxist-Leninist regimes pursuing socialist modernization in an underdeveloped economy, the Chinese Communists neither trusted nor removed the professional workers they inherited inside or outside the state after taking power. They used a combination of naked coercion and special privileges to expand, exploit, and control the professional workforce. My evidence suggests that this approach to building professions, which was first deployed by Lenin and the Bolsheviks after the 1917 Revolution, contributed in the long run to the destabilization of the Chinese Communist state during the Cultural Revolution. As a consequence of state policies and actions, disgruntled professional workers attacked their colleagues and Communist officials as the mass movement unfolded. Contrary to existing research on the Cultural Revolution, in which professional workers are invisible or portrayed as victims, this dissertation demonstrates that they actively participated in the mass movement, including making violence. It demonstrates that aside from well-documented contradictions in the process of socialist production, another important reason why state socialism waned was the failure of Marxist-Leninist regimes to create a supportive professional workforce to help them organize citizen consent. Finally, it demonstrates that the structural and cultural constitution of professional groups has real political impacts on the strength and stability of political rule.

The interactions between overseas sojourners and their families in Fujian encompass some of the central themes of this dissertation. It is about Fujianese family strategies in a fluid and unsettled world along the coast as well as across the ocean. The dissertation is also about the tension between the central government and coastal localities that probes the reciprocal construction of state power by ambitious local elites interacting with the imperial bureaucracy. It shows how Fujianese took overseas sojourning as a survival strategy, and how they continued to dream of an open maritime world without boundaries through their negotiations with the imperial state and with authorities in Southeast Asia. Finally, the dissertation emphasizes gender relations in this migrant society, investigating women writers' imaginings of the larger polity beyond the Fujian borders, and the life in female-headed households the sojourners left behind. Ethnicity is a growing key area of research in the New Qing history, not only because the ruling house was Manchu but also because Qing imperial policy attempted to civilize the borderland peoples in terms of a Manchu universalism ( tianxia yi jia ) that encompassed many different ethnic groups. The present project situates the reopening of the Fujian coast in the eighteenth century in the context of that Manchu universalism, to which Fujian elites consciously appealed. In the dissertation, I juxtapose this fluid maritime community against the women who served as anchors lest their kinsmen float too far from home.

304698297,"Whittaker, Jacob Tyler","Yi identity and Confucian empire: Indigenous local elites, cultural brokerage, and the colonization of the Lu-ho tribal polity of Yunnan, 1174–1745",Medieval,"This dissertation examines the history of the indigenous Lu-ho tribe in China's southwestern borderland, a Nasu Yi tribal polity formed during the twelfth century that maintained significant cultural and political autonomy until the late Ming period. The author argues that the Lu-ho elite were cultural brokers between imperial civilizers and indigenous peoples, adapting elements of the Confucian civilizing project to their own uses while preserving a ritual and social system that distinguished them from the Chinese. The Lu-ho lords and Yi tribal rulers like them actively sought economic opportunities in the increasingly commercialized Ming world, developing mines and manufacturing enterprises, as well as intensifying their agricultural practices. They adapted Chinese ideas about morality and social control to indigenous society, attempting to educate and indoctrinate obedient vassals who would be moral, productive, and frugal while performing the role of Confucian civilizers in a ‘barbaric’ frontier region. The Lu-ho lords actively manipulated imperial political discourses and worked pragmatically to influence those agents of the Ming state who might aid them against both radical civilizers in the Ming bureaucracy and enemies within the Lu-ho polity. However, the Lu-ho lords and their peers took care not to compromise a set of core structures that made them Ne (Yi) and kept the Ne tribal rulers in a position of collective power in the southwestern borderlands, even when the rituals that embodied those structures were suspect in the eyes of Confucian civilizers. The result of this syncretic mixing of Chinese and Yi elements was cultural change—“sinicization.” “Sinicization,” though, did not amount to assimilation. Instead, it brought consciousness of common ancestry, language, and customs that transcended tribal boundaries. The Lu-ho and other Yi tribal elites began to see themselves as an ethnic constituency within the Ming empire, and that thinking continued even as their polities were gradually broken apart and subjected to direct imperial rule in the late Ming and early Qing periods.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Davis,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, China, Colonization, Cultural brokerage, Ethnogenesis, Indigenous, Local elites, Lu-ho, Ming Empire, Native officials, Southwest China, Yi, Yi (ethnic group), Yunnan",10,Davis,California,38.5553,-121.737,United States
1112251233,"Wu, Yulian",Tasteful Consumption: Huizhou Salt Merchants and Material Culture in Eighteenth-Century China,Modern,"This dissertation focuses on the Huizhou salt merchants, studying their emergence as a distinguished social group--that is, as merchants who mastered various sorts of practical knowledge and managerial skills, cultivated aesthetic taste, and promoted Confucian morality—in eighteenth-century China. In contrast to previous scholarship on the rise of merchants in late imperial China, this research approaches the topic through the perspective of material culture, showing how the High-Qing Huizhou salt merchants used material objects—including tributary goods, carved seals, expensive genealogies, ancestral halls, and chastity arches—as media through which they strategically built up their vast social networks and sought upward social mobility. In their strategic engagement with objects—purchasing, making, collecting, exchanging—the salt merchants formed cross-regional social networks at every level of Qing society, from the imperial court in North China, to southern elites in the commercial centers of the Lower Yangzi, and finally to local communities in the merchants' native place, the mountainous backwater of Huizhou. By exploring the merchants' relationships with material objects, this dissertation offers unexpected new insight into ethnic relations, commerce, and consumption in early modern China. This study first provides a new perspective on critical ethnic relationships between the Manchu court and its Chinese subjects in the eighteenth century. My dissertation reveals a close emperor-merchant relationship that could only have been established under the Manchu rulers' unique salt monopoly policies. These policies allowed the merchants to serve as the emperor's informal bureaucracy and expanded the emperor's own empire-wide network of informal contacts and control. This dissertation also moves earlier analysis of the commercial revolution of the seventeenth century forward into the eighteenth century, addressing merchants' role in luxury consumption. By studying merchants' collecting enterprises, this research shows that the salt merchants performed a new role as trend setters in fashion and taste. Meanwhile, by examining merchants' patronage in their hometown, I show that as the merchants transformed their lineage patronage into extravagant cultural productions, rural Huizhou became an important part of the consumer society of the eighteenth century.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Davis,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, Economics, Social structure, China, Eighteenth century, Huizhou, Luxury consumption, Material culture, Merchants, Qing dynasty, Salt, Salt merchant, Social mobility",10,Davis,California,38.5553,-121.737,United States
808568223,"Wang, Yan",Idle consumers or productive workers: Leisured ladies in the urban commercial culture and the discourses of modernity in Late Qing China (1860–1911),Modern,"This study examines the daily life of daughters, wives, and concubines to reveal the marginalization of the traditionally valorized domestic sphere during the last five decades of the Qing dynasty. With the rise of industrial and commercial development, women in well-to-do urban households abandoned the “womanly work” of spinning, weaving, and embroidery – traditional symbols of womanly virtue – in favor of ready-made and tailored clothes, shoes, and other commodities available through the growing fashion industry. Thus adorned, they began to appear in public spaces as consumers and as leisured pleasure-seekers. This dissertation accordingly reveals the complex engagement of women in urban commercialization. Within the household, women continued their substantial role building the wealth and status of the family, using their investment skills, personal networks, and sensitivity to the new media. Yet in the context of the late Qing efforts to save the country, women’s domestic contributions were ignored. Instead, reform rhetoric criticized women’s confinement in the home, their lack of education, and their extravagant consumption as contributing to the ongoing political crises. This dissertation also highlights the pivotal function of merchants who made efforts to educate the younger generation of women in their families and networks, establishing girls’ school to respond to the reform rhetoric. The dissertation situates wives, daughters and concubines in the current historiography of talented High Qing women poets, passionate late Qing female reformers, modern “new women,” and Republican bourgeoisie housewives. It outlines a gradual cultural shift away from the “talented women” tradition of the Qing guixiu. In her place, we see women’s growing involvement in the monetary world. The conclusion links the marginalization of domestic work in the inner quarters during the late Qing era with the privatization of the domestic sphere under the Communist regime, stressing the modern state’s silence on women’s domestic burdens during campaigns to increase their labor outside the home, and the government’s continuing insistence on viewing women solely in the context of marriage and family.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Davis,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, Womens studies, China, Chinese women, Commercialization, Gentry-merchant, Intellectual history, Late Qing history, Leisured ladies, Qing dynasty",10,Davis,California,38.5553,-121.737,United States

This chapter estimates the rate of intergenerational social mobility in Late Imperial, Republican and Communist China by examining the changing social status of originally elite surnames over time. More specific, it identify surnames (or surname with particular places of origin) that are much more likely to show up among elites than among the general population during the initial period, and see how rapidly these surnames regress to its mediocrity. It finds much lower rates of mobility in all eras than previous studies have suggested, though there is some increase in mobility in the Republican and Communist eras. But even in the Communist era social mobility rates are much lower than are conventionally estimated for China, Scandinavia, the UK or USA. These findings are consistent with the findings of Campbell and Lee (2011) on the importance of kin networks in the intergenerational transmission of status. But it may reflect mainly a systematic tendency of conventional mobility studies to overestimate rates of social mobility. Chapter 2. Social mobility of Taiwan, 1949–2012 . This chapter estimates the social mobility of Taiwan after 1949, when the National Party of China was defeated in mainland China, and started to pursue social and economic policies different from those in mainland China. I trace the changing social status of “new mainlanders” who migrated to Taiwan as the ruling class around 1949. From 1957 population census, a group of 300 surnames were held by mainlanders with a proportion of 0.95 and above. 30 surnames were held by native Taiwanese with a proportion of 0.98 and above. I trace the relative status of these groups over time among top college students, doctors, and entrepreneurs. It shows that in Taiwan social mobility is slightly higher than in mainland China after 1949, but still much higher than conventional studies have suggested. Chapter 3. Taiping rebellion as a diversity shock: The failure of public primary schooling in the Lower Yangzi of the Republican Era (1900–1949) . This chapter explores the differential impact of the Taiping rebellion (1851–1864) and consequent mass migration on 60 counties in the lower Yangzi region of China. In the first few decades of the twentieth century, traditional education was replaced by modern education and informal tutoring was replaced by formal schools. It finds that places were less successful in financing primary schooling if they experienced a greater diversity shock. A diversity shock made local population more diverse culturally, linguistically and even genetically after the rebellion relative to its pre-Taiping population, as measured by inconsistency in surname distribution. This result is robust to controlling for trends in population density, for geographic factors that correlated with influences from the Western world, access to the political center, and initial educational outcomes. Overall, in the lower Yangzi delta, the richest area of China, modern primary enrollment was below 30% during the Republic era. This is one reason why elites from the exam era persist into the Republic era, and hence why there was low social mobility before 1949.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Davis,Economics,Economics,"History, Economics, Economic history, China, Elite, Intergenerational, Overrepresentation, Social mobility, Social status, Surname",10,Davis,California,38.5553,-121.737,United States
1735783132,"Richardson, Nicole Celeste","A Nation In Utero: Pregnancy and Fetal Education in Early Republican China, 1912-1937",Contemporary,"At the turn of the twentieth century, several prominent Chinese intellectuals advocated a return to the ancient practice of fetal education to save the nation by strengthening the Chinese race in utero. Fetal education instructed pregnant women to discipline their emotions, behavior, and environment to nurture the physical and moral development of the impressionable fetus. In the midst of early Republican debates over the role of women in China’s modernizing project, Chinese writers promoted, reformulated, or denounced fetal education as a way to strengthen the nation, selectively appropriating examples from Chinese, Japanese, and Western culture to bolster their arguments. As these writers reconciled new concepts from Western biomedicine with pre-existing Chinese ideas about pregnancy and reproduction, their choices influenced how they understood the female reproductive body and the relationship between the mother, the fetus, and the external environment. By situating these discussions in the broader context of Chinese debates over science, culture, gender, and the nation, this dissertation ultimately reveals the centrality of gender and the female body to Chinese modernity. The first two chapters of the dissertation argue that an earlier generation of modern syncretists such as Song Jiazhao played a pivotal role in translating and popularizing science, biomedicine, and eugenics in the nineteen teens, representing a robust synthesis of tradition, nationalism, and modernity that continued to thrive in the aftermath of the iconoclastic May Fourth generation. The third chapter reveals the contradictions in the efforts of May Fourth intellectual Huang Shi to liberate women from Confucianism and superstition by denouncing their reproductive customs. The fourth chapter shows how eugenicist Pan Guangdan argued that genetics alone—not environmental influences—determined an individual’s strength, intelligence, and moral character. The final chapter of the dissertation analyzes a popular pregnancy guide to show the emergence of a new consensus on reproductive advice, in which a modernized form of fetal education existed alongside eugenic and biomedical understandings of pregnancy. Finally, this dissertation argues that the combination of eugenics, nationalism, and biomedicine paved the way for increasing state interference in women’s reproductive lives.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Davis,History,History,"History, Modern history, China, Eugenics, Gender, Pregnancy, Taijiao, Women",10,Davis,California,38.5553,-121.737,United States
304496430,"McMahon, Daniel Mark","Restoring the garden: Yan Ruyi and the civilizing of China's internal froniters, 1795--1805",Modern,"Between 1795 and 1805, Yan Ruyi (1759–1826) aided China's government in restoring order to three regions devastated by insurgency: the borderland joining Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces (the site of the 1795–97 Miao rebellion). the borderland joining Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces (the site of the 1796–1804 White Lotus rebellion). and the coast of Guangdong province (the site of the 1790–1810 pirate attacks). During these ten years, Yan Ruyi served as a government advisor, researcher, and administrator, joining an influential group of statecraft reformers then shaping the reforms of the early Tiaqing (r. 1795–1820) reign. This study compares Yan's descriptions of, and proposals for, these three sites of conflict. The argument advanced draws from a model recently proposed by James Scott. It contends that Yan Ruyi, as a government link to China's border regions, provided a set of simplifications—corrected definitions of geography and society—essential to Qing administration. Likewise, he contributed planning and service to a new government project of legibility, ordering land and people to mirror an ideal of orthodox Confucian civilization. Yan played a vital role in a Qing Confucian civilizing project: one focused upon moral concerns, but modified to accommodate mountains and ocean, as well as Han and non-Han Chinese. This civilizing effort—in particular, as Yan Ruyi articulated it—was defined by a sense of crisis, hostile terrain, and 17th century models of public administration. In western Hunan, home to the Miao indigenes, Yan questioned the previous government incorporation of the 1730s, arguing for a partial return to indirect rule via tribal officials and gradual acculturation in the context of ethnic segregation. In southern Shaanxi, home to Han migrants, Yan called for a restoration of direct rule and an intensification of cultural indoctrination, reintegrating (that is, assimilating ) the Han back to Chinese ways. On the Guangdong coast, home to seafaring Han, Yan likewise called for intensified local defense and a restoration of direct administration.

In late imperial China, thousands of young women from various social backgrounds, referred to as zhennü or “faithful maidens,” responded to the death of a fiancé either by choosing to spend the rest of their lives as if they were widows, or by committing suicide as if they were “following a husband in death.” The rising numbers and growing visibility of such young women created controversy within the family and in the larger society, and provoked fierce debates among literati. The dissertation reconstructs the historical path of the cult's origin and its spread: the influence of state policies, the opinions and emotions of individuals, and the interactions among the family, the literati community, and local lineage organizations—all of which played a role in the spread of the faithful maiden phenomenon. Three factors crucially shaped the direction of the cult in the Qing period: dynastic transition, Manchu rule, and literati enthusiasm. The escalation of the cult compelled scholars to reexamine the canonical foundations of faithful maiden practices, giving rise to much tension as leading intellectuals struggled to find a ground where textual evidence, moral commitment, and personal emotions could be reconciled. Central to this study are questions about how gender identities were conceived and expressed by young women. By analyzing the rituals of spirit marriage and suicide, the faithful maidens' code of conduct, and their lives as “virgin mothers” and “virgin daughters,” the dissertation shows that a faithful maiden's understanding of her own place and of her proper role was profoundly rooted in the prevalent social value attached to yi (honor-bound duty), as well as in her feelings about her fiancé, qing (love). The practice of child betrothal was a key influence on a young woman's view of where and to whom she belonged as an adult. Meanwhile, classical and popular literature, which often featured allusions to and stories about qing and yi , supplied repertoires of practices and lore, through which young women absorbed norms, beliefs, and fantasies.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Davis,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, China, Faithful maiden cult, Qing dynasty, Spirit marriage",10,Davis,California,38.5553,-121.737,United States
304651832,"Smith, Adam Daniel",Writing at Anyang: The role of the divination record in the emergence of Chinese literacy,Ancient,"This dissertation assembles evidence and argument in favor of the hypothesis that Chinese literacy emerged in the context of the management of the Shang ancestral cult, with a central role played by the divination record, sometime around the middle of the second millennium. Chapter 1 argues that early writing systems are less likely to be products of “intelligent design” than of essentially blind evolutionary processes, and that the increasingly intensified and repetitive use of precursor sign systems, rather than utilitarian administrative needs, are what drive the emergence of literacy. Chapter 2 reviews competing hypotheses regarding the nature and extent of writing in late second millennium China, and the evidence for writing on materials, such as wood, that may not have been preserved. The chapter argues that the increasingly intense and repetitive cult activities at the major sites of the second millennium, and the divination that informed them, provide a likely context for the emergence of writing in the terms of Chapter 1. Moreover, the limited evidence for perishable writing materials suggests that they too were associated with the management of cult activities. Chapter 3 presents a detailed reconstruction of the organization and activities of one of the “divination workshops” at Anyang, represented by the inscribed plastrons from Huayuanzhuang dong di H3. The collaborative nature of the workshop procedures, and the frequency with which divination was performed and recorded are quantitatively assessed, in order to demonstrate that divination record-keeping was a high-frequency activity of full-time specialists, of the kind that could have supported the emergence of a writing system. Chapter 4 provides evidence for scribal training conducted within the divination workshops at late second-millennium Anyang. The fact that divination workshops trained their own scribes suggests that literacy was not generalized or widespread, and supports the claim that the divination records were central to the use and transmission of literacy. Chapter 5 summarizes the case for seeing the documentation of increasingly complex, repetitive and frequent Shang cult practices, including divination, as the primary area of literate activity during the second millennium BC.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Anyang, Archaeology, China, Divination record, Literacy, Oracle bone inscriptions, Shang dynasty, Writing",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
305348287,"Brown, Roxanna Maude",The Ming gap and shipwreck ceramics in Southeast Asia,Modern,"This dissertation uses shipwreck archaeological materials in Southeast Asia to discover the extent of trade ceramics shortages from China in the early Ming period and to describe the Southeast Asian ceramics that take their place. Firstly, some 120 maritime sites are organized into an approximate relative chronology. The chronology is shown on 24 tables that cover the years from the first centuries AD to the 20 th century. The analysis then focuses on 15 sites that cover the period circa 1368–1487. These sites reveal two types of shortages. Once Thai and Vietnamese ceramics join shipwreck cargoes in the Hongwu reign (1368–98) or very shortly thereafter, there is not a single shipwreck with 100% Chinese ware until the 16 th century. On shipwrecks from circa 1368–1430 the percentage of Chinese ware, which comprises primarily celadon and brown glazed wares, is 30–40%. On ships from approximately 1430–1487, the percentage of Chinese ceramics drops to 2% and usually less, and then in the Hongzhi (1488–1505) reign the percentage abruptly rises to about 90%. The Ming gap, a term that refers to a near absence of Chinese blue and white ware, runs from about 1352 through to the beginning of the Hongzhi reign when Chinese ware, including a large proportion of blue and white, floods onto the Southeast Asian market. Only one to three blue and white Chinese pieces are documented on shipwrecks from circa 1352–1450, and about a hundred examples are known for the years circa 1450–1487. Many thousands fill the shipwrecks from the Hongzhi reign. Besides finding evidence for shortages of Chinese ceramics, the research reveals, for the first time, a six-phase chronology for Thai ceramics. This chronology covers the late 14 th to late 16 th centuries. Vietnamese ceramics are divided into two major phases, circa 1368–1430 and circa 1450–1510. The abrupt disappearance of Vietnamese ware after about 1510 until about 1600 is here dubbed the ‘Mac (dynasty) gap.’ The ships also show evidence for the export of Central Vietnam Champa ceramics circa 1450–1475, and for Burmese ceramics circa 1470–1510. They also suggest minor shortages of Chinese ware in the middle 16 th century circa 1520–1560/70 when the only Southeast Asian exports came from Thailand.",2003,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Ceramics, China, Ming gap, Shipwreck, Southeast Asia, Thailand, Vietnam",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
304799329,"Lai, Guolong","The Baoshan Tomb: Religious transitions in art, ritual, and text during the Warring States period (480–221 BCE)",Ancient,"This dissertation explores historical transitions in funerary art, ritual, and text in their archaeological context by focusing on the tomb of a high-ranking Chu official, Shao Tuo (d. 316 BCE), discovered at Baoshan in Hubei Province. The Warring States transition has long been regarded as a process of rationalization and secularization, developing from the mystical, superstitious Shang and Zhou dynasties to the rational, bureaucratic Qin and Han empires. This contextual study problematizes this vision of antiquity, arguing that religious transitions played a vital role in shaping the intellectual and religious foundations of a unified empire. Chapter 2 demonstrates that the tomb inventories and funerary gift-lists as ritual devices structured the communication between humans and spirits, and that tomb construction, modeled on the cosmos, expressed new conceptions of the afterlife that emerged during the Warring States period. Chapter 3 shows that the practice of burying mingqi (“spirit artifacts”) and personal belongings was a form of a tie-breaking ritual, the purpose of which was to ritualize the gradual separation between the deceased and the living. Chapter 4 shows that the new categories of burial furnishings, such as lamps and folding beds, were chosen to perform specific religious functions. The lamps in the Baoshan tomb were to facilitate the spirit journey to the increasingly alienated, gloomy, and dangerous underworld, a conception of the afterlife that emerged in the Warring States era. Chapter 5 discusses the historical development of ancestral cults, changing from the use of living persons as impersonators to the concordant use of images. This transition led to the development of the burying of tomb figurines as substitutes of human servants, the use of spirit tablets, and a reinterpretation of the concept of wei (“position”) in early Chinese ritual art. The pictorial representation of the human figure originated in the context of rhetorical uses of works of art. Finally, the appendix reconsiders Karlgren's linguistic method of distinguishing “free” texts from “systematizing” texts, and draws connections between funerary texts and the genesis of ritual texts in Early China.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Art History, Religious history, Archaeology, History, Art, Baoshan Tomb, China, Religious transitions, Ritual, Warring States period",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
2162941338,"Mellors, Sarah",From Vinegar and Cotton Balls to Diaphragms and Vasectomies: Birth Control in Twentieth-Century China,Contemporary,"Since its enactment in 1979, the One Child Policy—which in theory limited Chinese couples to one child each—has made global headlines and been the focus of publications in a wide array of fields from public health to political science. Nevertheless, the majority of these works privilege the perspective of the state. Such accounts give little consideration to the decades leading up to the policy’s implementation and reaffirm the monolithic official narrative that radical state intervention was critical for reducing population growth and enabling rapid economic development. This dissertation seeks to emphasize the part played by individuals in shaping their own reproductive futures, granting users of birth control agency in a scholarly discourse dominated by top-down policies. Drawing on both archival and oral history, I examine birth control and abortion practices in the longue durée , beginning with the consolidation of Nationalist Party rule (1927-1949) and ending with the 2015 implementation of the Two Child Policy, which allows for two children per couple. In particular, I focus on the 50-year period preceding the enactment of the One Child Policy, drawing on the lived experience of birth control and abortion practices in three cities to complicate and challenge official narratives. My findings reveal that birth control and abortion had been utilized in urban China from at least as early as the Republican period (1912-1949), and that throughout the twentieth century, contraceptive practices differed according to class, location, gender, and other markers of identity. Furthermore, despite the introduction of an elaborate matrix of mechanisms to deepen state control over reproduction both before and during the One Child Policy era, this process was fraught with obstacles and inconsistencies. The result was that individual and familial considerations continued to shape reproductive decisions even amidst intensifying family planning campaigns. Contributing to interdisciplinary studies of medicine, the history of reproduction in China, and gender and sexuality studies, I highlight the coexistence and syncretism of traditional, Western, and folk contraceptive methods, reliance on abortion as a primary form of contraception, and the endurance of gendered reproductive responsibilities.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,History - Ph.D.,History,"Asian History, History, Birth control, China, Contraception, History of medicine, Modern China, One Child Policy",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

It engages in the studies of modern Chinese literature and culture from three perspectives. First, approaching martial arts fiction as a literary subgenre, it partakes in the genre studies of martial arts fiction and through investigating major writers and their works explains how the genre was written, received, reflected, and innovated during the period in question. Second, positioning martial arts fiction as one of the most well received literary subgenre in the modern Chinese literary field, it discusses the “great divide” between “pure” and “popular” literatures and the question of how to evaluate popular literature in modern China. Through a series of textual analysis contextualized in the lineage of martial arts fiction, it offers insight into how the ideals of so-called “pure” and “popular” literatures were interwoven in the process of reviewing and re-creating the genre. Third, it scrutinizes the transformation of modern martial arts fiction in relation to the modernization of Chinese literature. Using martial arts fiction as a focal point, it examines how the genre changes common understandings of how to write and read “literature” in the period in question. It suggests that the subgenre offered a new framing and a new cognitive structure for the nature and function of literature. This dissertation is composed of four body chapters. Chapter One focuses on the first decade of the twentieth century and argues that it witnessed the emergence of modern Chinese martial arts fiction. Chapter Two brings the jianghu (literally rivers and lakes) into focus as a key literary construct in modern martial arts fiction and illustrates the vacillating and intricate nature of its transformation. Chapter Three centers on the issues of historicity, fictionality, and how the changing dynamics between the two elucidate the conception of modern “literature” and a trajectory of literary autonomy. Chapter Four employs gender as a critical category of analysis and investigates the trajectory of literary autonomy through the metamorphosis of female knight-errant images spanning from the 1920s to 1940s. The concluding chapter reviews the reflections and attempts writers made in the 1930s and 1940s in order to integrate the genre into the mainstream literary discourse. By revisiting some most recent cultural phenomena, the Conclusion Chapter points out the question of how to understand and appreciate “literature” and its autonomy posed a century ago in martial arts fiction still echoes in contemporary China.",2016,2016,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Asian literature, Asian History, China, Imagination, Literary autonomy, Martial arts fiction",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
1400829646,"Li, Guangyi",Peace under Heaven: The (Re)Making of an Ideal World Order in Chinese Utopianism (1902–1911),Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the visions of an ideal world order in Chinese utopianism at the turn of the twentieth century. Utopian works produced at this time are addressed both as literary texts and as thought experiments. Reflections about an ideal world order first arose in pre-Qin times in the concept of tianxia (All-under-Heaven). Over time, a whole set of institutions evolved around tianxia, which became the kernel of state ideology. Only in the late Qing period, when China encountered unprecedented crisis occasioned by its introduction to the modern world by Western and Japanese imperialism, did intellectuals significantly revive the utopian implications of tianxia. Among the concerns of late Qing utopians, prospects for the Chinese/yellow race, the potential of science and technology, and the critical role of morality are the most prominent in their consideration of an ideal world order. Driven by obsession with China, they were inclined to envision a new China that restored its power through moral, social, and political reforms as well as technological progress, then to go on to establish the Chinese/yellow race's global hegemony. Interestingly and importantly, the imagined Sinocentric world order in these works features a tension between the desire to seek vengeance on the West and the hope to realize universal peace and prosperity. In some cases, the aim for universal peace, in the form of Pax Sinica, was actually complicit with Chinese global hegemony. However, there were also thoughtful proposals for a genuine universalism, such as Kang Youwei's Book of Great Unity. As discursive attempts to transcend Western modernity characterized by nationalism, colonialism, and industrial capitalism, these utopian works provide important perspectives not only for understanding Chinese history since the late Qing but also for imagining the future of a rising China where the discourse of tianxia has regained its prominence.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,East Asian Languages and Cultures 0232,East Asian Studies,"Asian literature, History, Asian Studies, China, Late Qing, Qing dynasty, Tianxia, Utopia, Utopianism, World order",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
304435269,"Zhang, Li","Strangers in the city: Space, power, and identity in China's floating population",Contemporary,"This dissertation is an ethnographic account of the development, destruction, and eventual reconstruction of Zhejiangcun, the largest migrant community in Beijing during China's economic reform and transition from socialism. It examines the congifuration of power relations within this nonstate organized community, and the relationship of this community to the state as millions of Chinese peasants (known as the floating population) break the constraint of the household registration system to search for work and better life opportunities in the cities. The dissertation addresses four interrelated questions: How does the state attempt to turn rural migrants into subjects for control in the new post-Mao socioeconomic order? How do migrants, in turn, challenge state control and struggle to reconstruct their identities and their communities? What kinds of social relationships, spatial organizations, and forms of local authority have emerged in this sub-group of the migrant population? In what ways are Chinese state-society dynamics reconfigured on the local-level in migrants' everyday life? The chapters explore these questions in the following specific social arenas in Zhejiangcun: migrant identity transformation, changing interpersonal and intergroup social relationships and power dynamics, migrant housing and market development, the formation of a popular migrant leadership, and the contestation of crime and order. The dissertation highlights a life-shattering event in which some forty thousand migrants were forcibly expelled from the Zhejiangcun settlement and their homes completely demolished by the state. Data for this research were collected through fifteen months of ethnographic fieldwork in Beijing and Wenzhou using three methods: long-term observation and participant observation. nearly 100 semi-structured interviews with rural migrants and many interviews with village cadres, government officials, and Beijing residents. and library research on government documents, state policies, and the representation of migrants in the media and press. This dissertation aims to provide a deeper understanding of the profound social and cultural changes occurring in post-Mao China by analyzing how such changes are articulated in a community of the floating population. Examining the dialectical relationship among space, power, and identity, and the shifting state-society dynamic, this study seeks to contribute to anthropological inquiries that integrate cultural analysis with political-economic accounts.",1998,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, Political science, China, Economic opportunities, Household, Industrialization, International trade, Peasants, Urbanization, Wuxi",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
304081530,"Pan, Ming-te","Rural credit market and the peasant economy (1600-1949): The state, elite, peasant and usury",Modern,"This study analyzes the rural credit market during a period (1600-1949) characterized by vigorous commercialization and two types of Chinese state building. By tracing the interactions of the state, elite, and peasants in the rural credit market, this work seeks to find the dynamics of an increasingly commercialized agricultural economy in the late imperial period (1600-1900). It also intends to answer a puzzle that has been perplexing many students who are interested in the Chinese Communist movement in the 1930s-1940s: how was the Chinese Communist Party able to use a platform emphasis land reform to mobilize peasants in places where tenancy was not a major concern? This study argues that the traditional rural credit market was crucial to a market oriented agricultural production which emerged in the seventeenth century China. It also shows that prior to the nineteenth century, the Confucian state making affected the rural credit market positively. While many scholars argue that using high interest rural credit impoverished peasants, I argue that although the interest rates on loan were high, when peasants used rural credit to produce for the market, they were able to raise their standard of living above what they would have been otherwise. Furthermore, Confucian state making in the Qing created a significant formal rural credit market, which provided regulated, affordable credit to peasants and competed with the informal rural credit. The social economic changes and the modern state building in the twentieth century, however, altered the configuration of the rural credit market in ways which proved to be especially damaging to the peasants in the economically underdeveloped areas. The commercialization in the twentieth century further increased peasants' dependency on credit for production. In the meantime, modern state became less interested in and capable of intervening on the rural credit market. Without access to the formal rural credit, peasants of economically underdeveloped areas were trapped in debt. This was the reason why the Chinese Communist Party's land reform policy--rent reduction and interest reduction--could create a mass support among the peasants in Northwest and North China, where tenancy alone was not a major issue.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Economic history, History, China",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

It identifies several patterns of peasant demographic behaviors that had contributed to the phenomenon of high population pressure on land. Alongside with competitive market systems, including active factor markets at the village level, population pressure on limited land resources had been accumulating in rural communities generation after generation, long before industrialization and urbanization. While such accumulated population pressures might have pushed growth in gross output, yield, and even output per capita, it had also led to a unique mode of production in rural China, which was family-based, labor-intensive, and driven by inputting more quantity of labor in the long-run. Unless there were fundamental structural changes occurring outside the villages, which could generate enough economic opportunities to absorb rural laborers, a traditional urban economy would not be able to defeat the involutionary forces that kept generating population growth endogenously.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Economic history, History, Demographics, Geography, China, Household, Land use, Population pressure, Village",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
304429277,"Isett, Christopher Mills","State, peasant and agrarian change on the Manchurian frontier, 1644-1940",Contemporary,"This study links long-term socio-political change to economic developments on the Manchurian plain. It examines the appearance and initial formation of peasant communities, lays out how peasants subsequently set about organizing village socio-economic activities, and then traces the unfolding of the peasant economy over the course of the Qing and first half of the twentieth century. Despite state endeavors to the contrary, villages in rural Manchuria attained a remarkable degree of autonomy. By the mid 1700s servile forms of labor and tenancy, the socio-political basis of the early Manchurian agrarian order, had retreated in the face of an increasingly free and assertive peasantry. With village autonomy secured, and the authority of the land-possessing peasantry in place, the ground was cleared for the formation of a free peasant economy rooted in peasant proprietorship. Under these conditions, despite two centuries of trade growth, peasants producers did not respond to the market in a Smithian fashion: (1) shielded from the competitive pressures of the market, by virtue of their possession of land, they were neither compelled to specialize or match technological improvements made by other producers. (2) even though the market may have provided opportunities for gain, the trade off from these gains were offset by the risks of market uncertainties and the threat the market posed to long-term peasant strategies of reproduction. Peasant production was characterized by low market involvement and a preference for crops which intensified labor inputs and best met subsistence needs rather than maximized profits.

Second, it uses court cases from local archive collections in China.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Agrarian, China, Manchurian, Peasant, State",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

Closely reading new and familiar primary sources from a broadly contextualized Chinese perspective, this study goes beyond the theoretical frameworks used in the past, sidestepping artificial Sino-Japanese parallels and ideological comparisons. Avoiding one-dimensional interpretations, it looks at Okakura's struggles with Eurocentrism, Sinocentrism and Japancentrism in a double-edged colonialist ideology. It also highlights a gender approach in Okakura's political agenda and connects this to Tokugawa Confucians' analogies and the Taishô avant-garde's advocacy of returning to Japan. The issue of China emerged in Okakura's early career as he promoted an ambitious diplomatic campaign by Japan and became a critical component of his anti-Hellenistic construction of Japanese art history. To further develop China's role in this construction, he took his first trip to China at the dawn of the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). This visit not only destroyed his Chinese fantasy but also became a milestone in his thought, laying a substantial foundation for his art history, civilization, and political theories. He discovered shasei (realism) in Chinese landscape painting. gained significant perspective, especially on racial issues, from North-South differences he observed. made interesting linguistic experiments in his playful kanshi compositions. expanded his definition of bijutsu in the Chinese art market. fully developed an anti-Hellenistic statement in the Longmen Caves. and offered political strategies and intellectual solutions for the Sino-Japanese conflict. All these ideas were fully applied and expanded in his subsequent thought and art practices. Okakura explored the image of China as Japan's Other in the past and the metaphor for Japan's antiquity. to help Japan reach parity with the new Other---the West---he disarmed modern China by dismantling its centrality in the modern order of Asia.

250914170,"Zhuang, Jiayun",Not yet farewell: Postsocialist performance and visual art in urban China,Contemporary,"This dissertation explores, in detail, a variety of postsocialist theater, performance, and visual art works that re-signify the country's revolutionary and socialist history. Taking a deep look at the somatic and semiotic practices of performative resignification, this dissertation examines the pieces that invent new ways to represent how prior socio-political and ideological codes continue to inform the culture of the postsocialist present. Overflowing with historically and ideologically-laden gestural and visual signs, these performative practices challenge the previously state-sanctioned ideologies in a cross-historical dialogue. Chapter 1 , as the introduction of this study, lays out the conceptual framework for the dissertation, probing the theoretical and historical ramifications of the postsocialist performance and visual art in the PRC, as well as engaging recent scholarship on the subject. Chapter 2 focuses on two independent theater groups in urban China as well as their major performance productions: (1) the dance-theater group Shenghuo wudao gongzuoshi (The Living Dance Studio). (2) the dance-theater group Zuhe niao (The Niao Collective). This chapter explores the ways in which the dance-theater groups deliberately rework the normalized physical and linguistic signifiers in the socialist representation system, in order to detach their practices of zhiti xiju (physical theater) from huaju (spoken drama—the particular form of modern, western-style theater that first made its appearance at the turn of the 20 th century). Chapter 3 explores the new citadel of contemporary Chinese art—Factory 798 in Beijing, also called 798 Art District and Dashangzi Art District nowadays. This chapter, by examining a number of performance pieces enacted in Factory 798 in detail, tackles the question of post-socialist nostalgia, since a particular socialist history has been repeatedly compressed and resignified within this specific factory space. Chapter 4 focuses on a large-scale collective art and social project launched in 2002, entitled the Long March, A Walking Visual Display , which echoed and responded to the historical Long March of the Communist-led Red Army in the mid-1930s. In this chapter, I examine a number of performance pieces enacted at the particular site along the journey: while some resignified the revolutionary signs that have been central to the Chinese revolutionary narratives or the model work of socialist realism, others performed certain bodily phenomenon, such as repetition compulsion , to act out the failure of remembering the past occurrences or the resistance of entering into the ideologically-reconstructed past.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Art history, Theater, Performing Arts, China, Performance, Postsocialist, Urban communities, Visual art",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
893656643,"Hu, Brian",Worldly Desires: Cosmopolitanism and cinema in Hong Kong and Taiwan,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the role that cinema played in imagining Hong Kong and Taiwan's place in the world during decades in which the idea of belonging and identity was under duress. In fan magazines with names like International Screen and in films with titles like Cosmopolitan Fantasy , the dissertation unearths two generations of discourses on cosmopolitanism, an ideal of being a citizen of the world, a provocative possibility of belonging for residents in islands turbulently on the peripheries of colonizers and nations. In direct response to state policy and socio-political upheaval, cinema proposed audio-visual possibilities that spectacularly imagined mobile figures who are flexible to the ways of the world, and in their often flamboyant worldliness, reworked ideas of the national in dynamic and pragmatic ways. In these cinemas, the cosmopolitan is an ideal type – fashioned, beautified, and accented in urban, international styles – that suggests a promise of belonging in an international space and time: mobility across national borders and coevality with the future-looking global market. This dissertation tracks the ideal across historical periods, specifically in the popular culture of the first generation born in Hong Kong and Taiwan after the massive demographic and political changes following the Civil War on the mainland, as well as the film, music, and television of their children's generation. The dissertation also tracks discourses of cosmopolitanism as it is embedded across various kinds of cinematic pleasures and industrial practices such as beauty, fashion, music, genre, stardom, and advertising. Each chapter examines a different expression of the cosmopolitan ideal as it manifested in specific historical and geographic contexts: worldly dance and fashion in 1950s and 60s Hong Kong musicals produced by Shaw Brothers and MP&amp.GI studios, proto-cosmopolitan heroism in the Shaolin Temple martial arts cycle of the 1970s and 80s, overseas students in love in the propagandistic family melodramas of 1970s Taiwan, the mixed-race and bicultural Chinese Americans and Chinese Canadians who took the Hong Kong and Taiwan media industries by storm in the 1990s and 2000s, and the cosmopolitan self-fashioning of state bureaucrats and representatives in international film markets of the 21 st century. In looking at these various phenomena, the dissertation argues that cinema in Hong Kong and Taiwan played a critical role in helping navigate and make sense of the emotional challenges suggested by the seemingly imminent arrival of globalization.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Asian American Studies, Film studies, China, Cinema, Cosmopolitanism, Film, Hong Kong, Stardom, Taiwan",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
305221528,"Rusk, Bruce Arthur",The rogue classicist: Feng Fang (1493–1566) and his forgeries,Modern,"This dissertation examines the textual forgeries of Feng Fang (1493–1566?) against the background of the intellectual and cultural history of the Ming period in China. The forgeries were variant versions of several canonical texts, most of the Five Classics and one of the Four Books (collectively, the so-called “Confucian Classics”). The forgeries were part of a complex engagement by Ming scholars with a long legacy of scholarship, especially with the Song dynasty Dao Learning enshrined as state orthodoxy. Chapter One examines practices of collection, authentication and publication, the context of the creation of the forgeries. It describes Ming debates about the proper purposes and methods of collection, especially of books, and about whether collections were rightfully individual or family property. Chapters Two and Three study the growing importance of archaic scripts and paleography in the sixteenth century. It shows that the scripts Feng Fang invented for his forgeries, based partly on reliable sources and partly on speculation, matched readers' expectations of ancient writing. Chapter Four examines the most successful of the forgeries, the Stone Classics Great Learning ( Shijing daxue ), arguing that the forgery reflects longstanding concerns and debates about the Great Learning . The forgery further destabilized an already shaky text. The chapter shows that the Stone Classics Great Learning was variously interpreted by different readers, notably its first publisher, Wang Wenlu (1503–1586), who was complicit in the deception. Chapter Five deals with the forgeries connected to the Poetry Classic ( Shijing ), tracing their position in the development of studies of this work and the trend towards more literary readings of it in the late Ming. It also demonstrates the role of publishers in promoting the forgery. The Conclusion examines the reception of Feng Fang in the centuries after his death, tracing his decline from reputable scholar to laughingstock. While Feng's forgeries came under attack in the late Ming and early Qing, those who debunked them shared or absorbed many of his assumptions. both acceptance and rejection of the forgeries could destabilize the canon.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, China, Classicist, Feng Fang, Forgeries, Ming dynasty",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

This study investigates the importance of art in understanding cultural transmission and intercultural connections as well as the manifold relationship among artistic agents and objects in the ritual, political, socio-economical, and intellectual contexts of the Chosoˇn dynasty. Focusing on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Chosoˇn court screens, which depict themes deriving from Chinese textual and pictorial sources that were widely appreciated in Korea and Japan, this dissertation explores the perception and circulation of images, the dissemination of knowledge and social customs, the ritual use of visual objects, the deployment of art in palatial structures, and the role of artistic agents in the consumption and production of court art. It encompasses examination of the ways in which meaning is constructed, modified, and reinstated both in textual and visual forms, and what may happen when themes from a literary text are adapted to painting as well as moving across time and cultures. While challenging the idea of a unilateral Chinese 'influence' on Korean culture, which neglects the role of Korean artists, patrons, and beholders as active agents, this study aims to unveil the process of appropriation of Chinese themes and the causes that affected this process, whether political, socio-economic, intellectual, or artistic. In order to identify the dynamics between human agents, institutional systems, and objects and to analyze the cultural transmissions from China and the eclecticism reflected in Chosoˇn art, I use two important theoretical concepts, agency and cultural translation. Emphasizing the political functions of court art, I use three case studies of court paintings produced to decorate palace buildings and to commemorate court rituals. First, I examine commemorative court screens in which stories of celebrated figures from Chinese literature and lore are fused with actual Chosoˇn court events. These paintings successfully satisfied the demands of agents who wanted to elevate contemporary events by superimposing well-known exemplary ancient images on current secular occasions. Second, I analyze paintings depicting two legendary banquets of Chinese mythical and historical figures, which were produced to celebrate festive court rites in the nineteenth century. By identifying the patrons, their political standing, and the purpose of the paintings, I explore the way these paintings constructed a symbolic space pertaining to state rituals and expressed the agendas of a particular political party. I further explore how these paintings expressed the social values and political agendas of their patrons in a ritualistic way by examining the interplay between visual and non-visual forms of art in court rites. Third, I use screen paintings depicting Chinese sage rulers and idealized images of Chinese antiquity to explore how Chinese rulership and ideal society was represented at the Chosoˇn court and how the current material culture and knowledge introduced from outside were integrated in the representation of an imaginary, ancient Chinese empire.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,Art History 0093,Art History,"History, Asian Studies, Art history, Agency, China, Chinese image, Choson (joseon) court art, Cultural translation, Korea, Nineteenth-century choson (joseon), Transculturalism",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
1112073961,"Gao, Nuan","Constructing China's Public Sphere: The Three Big Newspaper Supplements of the May Fourth Era, 1915–1926",Contemporary,"My dissertation focuses on the supplements of three influential Chinese newspapers of the May Fourth era (circa late 1918 to early 1926): Chenbao, Minguo ribao and Shishi xinbao. All of these newspaper supplements served as popular forums for discussion and debates. They published speeches, articles and letters by both intellectuals and people of different social strata, and they showcased a wide spectrum of political views. Through case studies of these supplements and of specific debates, I strive to shed new light on the ongoing debate within the Western academy on the relevance of the concept of the public sphere for making sense of developments in modern Chinese history. I also compare and contrast the strategies and rhetoric of left-wing and moderate intellectuals, as they engaged in activities that helped to construct and define the Chinese public sphere. Building on the conceptualization of the public sphere of Jurgen Habermas, as well as on major works in Chinese studies that seek to modify and extend his arguments to take into account other phenomena and political players (Chambers of Commerce, workers' union, influential newspapers, etc), I focus on five debates in which, I claim, newspaper supplements served a very Habermasian function in terms of their inclusivity and creation of a setting in which many actors could exchange their opinions on a relatively level playing field. I emphasize the important role that moderate intellectuals played in these debates as editors and writers—roles that have sometimes been overlooked due to the focus that many scholars have had on figures allied to radical causes. Through analysis of the debates and discussions of the time, I attempt to show that the brief flourishing of a vibrant public sphere during the May Fourth era owed much to the actions of editors committed to rationality and open exchanges of opinion, qualities that were less highly valued by more dogmatic figures, including some of those who would become leading intellectual figures within the Chinese Communist Party.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,History - Ph.D.,History,"History, Asian Studies, China, May Fourth Era, Public sphere, Three Big Newspaper Supplements",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
879042861,"Fuller, Pierre Emery","Struggling with Famine in Warlord China: Social Networks, Achievements, and Limitations, 1920-21",Contemporary,"This dissertation makes the case that in China's most severe food crisis of the first quarter of the 20 th century, the great north China famine of 1920-21, considerable life-saving relief was generated by three segments of society largely neglected in the existing literature: Buddhist and other native charity efforts working along parallel social channels to the better-publicized missionary and international relief groups. the Republic's maligned military establishment. and officials and residents of the stricken communities themselves who were operating largely below the radar of the distant, mostly city-based chroniclers of the famine whose interpretations have been privileged in subsequent histories. In the process, this study makes several historiographic interventions: first, it expands the study of modern north China relief beyond the imperial and modern state apparatus. In doing so, one can identify a paternalistic relief culture shared by state and extragovernmental actors in the countryside that operated at multiple levels simultaneously and that persisted despite the Qing collapse and increased marginalization of China's interior. Second, this study offers a corrective to the scholarly emphasis on the culture of modernizing elites in more affluent and Western-influenced south China and the treaty ports, arguing that the prominence of southern elites in late 19 th and early 20 th century disaster relief elsewhere in the country was more a function of shifting economic resources to the coasts and new forms of media than the emergence of a new modern civic or humanitarian consciousness. This corrective allows us to trace continuities with traditional Chinese society stretching well into the 20 th century, to appreciate the social dynamic of inland communities, and to recognize the possibility of multiple, alternative modernities coinciding in China's many regions. Finally, this study suggests that the dating of China's descent into a country of predatory state policies, widespread social dislocation, and incessant civil war—all the hallmarks of warlordism—be pushed back to the mid-1920s, half a decade after our famine. In short, this dissertation offers grounds for the reconsideration of the trajectory of modern Chinese history through the prism of social responses to disaster in the early 20 th century.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,History - Ph.D.,History,"History, Asian Studies, Modern history, Public administration, Public policy, Charity, China, Disaster relief, Famine, Famine relief, Humanitarianism, Social history",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

It compares the GMD efforts on mainland China during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) with the early years following its 1949 retreat to Taiwan, where it re-established its government. During the war, the GMD aided secondary school students who fled from Japanese-occupied territories by establishing schools for them to continue their schooling. However, the GMD’s Three People’s Principles Youth Corps (SQT) was generally a failure on the mainland, while the China Youth Corps (CYC) created in 1952 on Taiwan was a remarkable success in its formative years. The SQT never was a channel for student political activism, but instead merely served as a strategic instrument for the GMD to depoliticize youth. For the most part, student members were even excluded from taking charge of their own organization’s activities. Moreover, the intra-party factions within the GMD ultimately led to the SQT’s dissolution in 1947 after a brief, nine-year existence. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s China Youth Corps distinguished itself by emphasizing leisure activities, which made it more appealing to students. Compared to the SQT, the CYC took a broader approach to student life and learning, and focused more on youth concerns beyond the realm of politics. In order to maintain discipline in youth and prepare for a Communist invasion, the GMD also mandated military training for all senior high students. Combined with CYC activities meant to foster martial spirit, military training also taught students civic duty and patriotism, enabling the GMD to successfully exert control over youth in 1950s Taiwan.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,History - Ph.D.,History,"History, Asian Studies, Secondary education, China, Education, Guomindang, History, Taiwan, War",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

Was it simply a dynastic revolution? Or was it a revolution that cut deep into the late nineteenth-early twentieth century Chinese society, ushering it into the modern period of the Chinese history? My approach is to explore the era by tracing the development of two decisive generations of new young elite---the younger 1880s generation and the 1900 generation. My discovery was that they, starting from the 1898 Wuxu Reform, these two generations had been in steady contact with foreign culture through career and education advancement. Culturally, these generations created an unprecedented youth culture which I designate as Xinhai youth culture by which they distinguished themselves from the older generations. In terms of national movement, they, benefited by their older generations' legacy, waged Constitutional Movement and Revolutionary Movement. The careers of the younger 1880s generation and the 1900 generation intertwined with the two movements and through the process the members of these generations obtained new social identities as journalist, publisher, educationalist, scientist, new military men and new style politician. The consequence was a beginning of a deep cut structural change in the Chinese society from the monolithic domination of the official gentry into a pluralistic society.

305218897,"Neighbors, Jennifer Michelle",Criminal intent and homicide law in Qing and Republican China,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the categorization of homicide offenses and the treatment of criminal intent in China from the eighteenth century to 1949. Using a combination of local- and central-level court cases from the Qing dynasty and the Republican era, in conjunction with legal codes and the writings of jurists, this project highlights the complexity with which Chinese law addressed abstract concepts, particularly that of criminal intent. Criminal intent was an important category of analysis for Qing jurists, one conceptualized along a finely graded continuum of severity. Six categories of intent-based homicide were identified in the legal codes as the major homicide offenses. For the category of premeditated killing the intent to kill arose before the crime was carried out, whereas for the category of sudden intent killing the intent to kill arose only at the moment of the crime. Additional categories covered homicides resulting from an intent to harm but not to kill, and homicides committed with recklessness, through negligence, or by accident. During the early years of the twentieth century, China initiated a series of sweeping legal reforms. For criminal law, this meant promulgating a new criminal code based on models from continental Europe, where recent legal codes were composed of general, principle-based statutes intended to cover all possible criminal situations. This first Republican-era code thus contained only two generalized categories of criminal culpability, intent and negligence, and demoted further evaluation of criminal intent to the sentencing phase of a trial. The new, foreign-based code failed to cope adequately with broad areas of late imperial Chinese law. As a result, much of Republican lawmaking became focused on modifying the new criminal code to re-introduce Qing statutory provisions. At the same time, Republican law in practice reveals judges using their newly expanded discretionary powers to nullify many of the remaining breaks with the Qing legal tradition.

304649457,"Wang, Wensheng","White Lotus rebels and South China pirates: Social crises and political changes in the Qing empire, 1796–1810",Modern,"This dissertation is a multi-case, multi-region study of two concomitant crises—the White Lotus rebellion in central China (1796-1805) and outbursts of piracy across the South China Sea (1790s-1810)—during the Jiaqing reign (1796-1820) of the Qing dynasty. Conventional scholarship tends to examine both upheavals from a bottom-up perspective of societal change and to look at them in isolation from each other as clear evidence of state decay. On a broader level, the Jiaqing reign—bounded by the splendid eighteenth century and the tragic post-Opium War era (1839-1911)—has often been depicted as a dead middle era with no meaningful changes, or as the crisis-ridden beginning of dynastic decline. To challenge such an overly simple interpretation, this project takes an in-depth look at the process of crisis management, examining how the emperors, bureaucrats, literati, and local people understood and responded to this extraordinary combination of disturbances (and to each other). This dissertation argues that the two catastrophic events propelled the Qing regime to reorganize itself and thus produced a path-shaping conjuncture in the interlocking structural transformation of state, society, and culture. The resulting changes included a reform of the central bureaucratic establishment, local mobilization under gentry leadership, and a more flexible approach to popular religion, the maritime world, and foreign diplomacy. These adjustments did not represent the acceptance of inevitable dynastic decline as older treatments of the Jiaqing reign suggest, but a pragmatic retreat that sought to pull Qing state making away from a vicious cycle of aggressive overextension that bred resistance back onto a sustainable track of political development. Once we take the creative reform initiatives of this period seriously, we see many of them laid the foundation for long-term successful strategies of late Qing empire building. This dissertation also appropriates recent theoretical insights developed in political science and sociology and, moreover, combines them in a systematic manner. It seeks to advance a broader, more comprehensive approach around the concept of what I term “encompassing contentious crisis” for studying clustering, many-sided upheavals and their role in historical development.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, China, Crisis, Cultural development, Jiaqing reign, Pirates, Political change, Qing empire, South China piracy, White Lotus rebellion",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
305350613,"Kuo, Margaret","The handmaid of the revolution: Gender equality and the law of domestic relations in Republican China, 1912–1949",Contemporary,"To study the regulation of gender relations in Republican China is to confront the broad problem of how ideas and practices of equality (human equality in general, and legal and gender equality more specifically) transformed and did not transform a social and family structure that had long instituted one of the most hierarchical systems of human relationships. Of course, the lawmakers' attempt to restructure a system based upon rank, status, and ritualized distinctions between the superior and the inferior into one based upon individual rights and gender equality generated a great amount of tension and conflict. This dissertation aims to illuminate the tensions inherent in such a project at the level of both legal ideology, through analysis of the formal legal debates over gender equality, and at the level of everyday life, through analysis of archival case records of actual family conflicts and marital disputes. The dissertation begins with the conceptual underpinnings and animating rationale of gender equality in the civil law codification debates of the 1920s. It illustrates the process by which legislators fundamentally reconceptualized legal definitions of personhood, marriage, and kinship and restructured marital, family, and property relations according to the principle of gender equality and their vision of modernity. Then the dissertation examines the conflicts that arose in the 1930s and 1940s when the legislative ideology of gender equality was subjected to popular debate with respect to surname usage and applied to the experience of litigation and adjudication over husband impotence, the cohabitation obligation, divorce on the grounds of cruelty, and alimony. Litigants appealed to the new provisions for gender equality in ways not intended by legislators. Abstract notions of gender equality between a man and a woman, moreover, provided little guidance to judges who wrestled with the personal, moral, and economic considerations raised in actual disputes between husbands and wives. These findings raise questions about the ultimate desirability of gender equality envisioned for autonomous, rights-bearing individuals when Chinese women continued to be identified primarily by dependent family relationships.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, China, Domestic relations, Gender equality, Law, Republican, Revolution",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
1372806738,"Shi, Xia","Reconfiguring Traditions: Gender, Philanthropy, and Public Life in Early Twentieth-Century China",Contemporary,"This dissertation investigates how traditional home-based women came out of domestic seclusion and adapted to the expanding opportunities available to them at the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and beginning of the Republican era (1912-1949). Much of our current scholarship seems to imply that these women, who were often praised in Late Imperial times as the epitome of female virtues, were immediately eclipsed by the Western-based independent New Women of the Republic. Using a variety of archival documents from China and the US as well as oral history materials, this project combines biographies and case studies--of activities such as organized national disaster relief efforts carried out by the wives of scholar-officials in the late Qing, to local housewives' interactions with foreign social service organizations such as the YWCA, to illiterate Buddhist women of merchant families engaging with indigenous popular redemptive societies such as the School of the Way (Daoyuan). It demonstrates the continued importance of this category of women—some of them became effective actors in a modern urban society, despite being stereotyped as parasites on their husbands and on society. Meanwhile, it shows how legacies from the past actually empowered women seeking to reposition themselves without completely repudiating old roles, which continued to give them access to important material and ideological resources. In addition to adding a much-needed gender perspective to the burgeoning historiography on modern Chinese philanthropy, it questions one overly simplistic line of feminist analysis on modern Chinese women's history, which has narrowly focused on themes such as radical, highly individualistic strategies of emancipation, and demonstrates how this framework concealed important and sensitive issues surrounding these women's public philanthropic activities. Finally, as a social historical investigation of the significance of religious and philanthropic activities as forms of social, civic and political engagement, socializing and networking, this dissertation emphasizes that ideas and practices often consigned to irrelevance by Whiggish readings of modern Chinese history actually remained very important, and highlights how some of the practices have recently re-emerged in contemporary Chinese society and are now tolerated or even celebrated as manifestations of local culture.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,History - Ph.D.,History,"History, China, Domestic seclusion, Foot binding, Gender roles, Public life",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
304425027,"Yun, Peter I.","Rethinking the tribute system: Korean states and northeast Asian interstate relations, 600-1600",Modern,"Traditional Chinese dynasties viewed their interactions with foreign people in terms of the tribute system. Although the Chinese side always represented the relationship as its suzerainty over other states, the actual relations between China and its neighbors encompassed a wide range of political relationships from total subjugation to virtual equality. No single framework or generalization such as the tribute system can explain patterns of Northeast Asian foreign relations for two millennia. There have been recent studies re-examining the tribute system, but they have focused primarily on relations between China and Central Asian or Manchurian entities. Any comprehensive reassessment of the Fairbankian model of the tribute system and its applicability to the full historical range of interstate relations in East Asia must take into account the case of Korea, the so-called model tributary state. Scholars often trace traditional Korea-China tributary relations back to the fourth century and assume that Korea-China relations persisted unchanged until the nineteenth century. However, it was the Choson-Ming relations that gave rise to a notion of the Korean state as the model tributary in the Chinese world order. Choson was an exception in its adherence to the ideals of the tribute system, but the historically unique Choson-Ming relations have been ahistorically taken as typical and representative of all Korea-China relations throughout history. A dramatic change in Northeast Asian foreign relations came about as a result of the Mongol conquest. Before the Mongol conquest of the thirteenth century, there were triangular geopolitical configurations that maintained an equilibrium of military power. Continental conflicts and rivalry between Manchurian and Chinese states afforded maneuvering rooms for Korean states to pursue a pragmatic and independent foreign policy. Even in the early Choson period, the Koreans showed a pragmatic and flexible attitude. However, the Korean elites gradually began to develop a strong ideological belief in the Neo-Confucian orthodoxy and inherent moral correctness of the tribute system. By the sixteenth century, the practical political and military decisions of the fourteenth century have been transformed into an ideological commitment, one that was validated and strengthened by Ming assistance to Choson against Japanese invaders at the end of the sixteenth century. Thus, the notion of the Korean state as a model tributary was a recent and unique historical phenomenon applicable only to the mid-Choson period.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, China, Interstate relations, Korean, Northeast Asian, Tribute system",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

An event of signal consequence for 20 th century China, land reform has typically been viewed in either economic or political terms, a result of a tendency of scholars to focus on one-half of the campaigns, either stopping or starting their inquires at the 1949 divide. In order to give fitting scope to this subject, this study sees land reform as a single event, a framework that elucidates the true significance of land reform as a cultural campaign. Utilizing a diverse set of sources including novels, operas, songs, and even antithetical couplets, this dissertation explores how a highly politicized political culture embedded new rhetoric and ritual forms in the countryside, altering values and expectations at the rural level and allowing the implementation of land reform. This political culture, however, was not confined to rural society, and was actively disseminated in urban areas ensuring that all members of Chinese society would need to adapt to land reform political culture. This study thus explores some of the key carriers of land reform political culture, such as novels and operas, as well as the rhetoric and rituals that permeated village life both during and after the land reform era.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, China, Land reform, Opera, Political culture, Rhetoric, Ritual",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

This new perspective consists of two strands, cultural traffic and cultural exchange, which are used to explore the travel of cultural, political, and commercial agents and the circulation of their practices of technology, goods, theatrical repertoires, tastes of consumption, as well as coded spaces. These travels and circulation originated from the dual historical contexts of the mid-nineteenth century, the opening of Shanghai as a sea port and a geographic shift caused by the partial closure of the Grand Canal and the Taiping Rebellion (1852–64). The goal of this dissertation is to explore the invention of Shanghai in the trans-regional historical transformation, rather than as an isolated development, by showing the cross flows of cultures and interactions among actors from different parts of China, Asia, and the world. The dissertation consists of three parts, each deals with a group of connected themes. Part I consists of three chapters that explore the dissemination of science, technology, and knowledge by expert translators, printers and publishers. The dissemination of scientific knowledge and technology never went in a single direction, but reflected the way in which historical actors devoting themselves in building bridges and making borders as means of inducing or restricting the cross-cultural circulation of knowledge and technology. Part II consists of two chapters that deal with the issue of the regional shift of urban culture from the Canal-based cities to the seaport. The (re)territorialization of popular theaters and the relocation of Jiangnan aesthetic interiors in Shanghai were different manifestations of this geographic shift. Part III also contains of two chapters that examine the cross-cultural adaptation as symbolic act to the global economic circulation.

275696920,"Zhang, Li","Peasant household economy under the influence of international trade, industrialization, and urbanization: A case study of Wuxi peasants' response to economic opportunities, 1860s–1940s",Contemporary,"This study approaches the issue of peasants' response to economic opportunities through an examination of the economic behaviors of Wuxi peasant households in sericulture and their reaction to the modern economic sectors. Based upon a careful analysis of historical quantitative data and literary records, the study offers its own arguments and opinions on the driving forces behind sericultural development in Wuxi and China, on the motivation of peasants to engage in sericulture and switch to the modern economic sectors, and on the main factors which influenced the decision-making of peasant families of whether or not to have family member working in cities. The study contends that international trade was the main driving force behind the rise and fall of sericulture in China from the 1840s to the 1930s. From the 1860s to the 1920s, sericulture provided Wuxi peasant households not only a higher family total income but also a higher net income per workday. In its study on Wuxi rural laborers' emigration into cities, the study reveals that family structure and labor resources played significant roles in family decision-making. The development of factory industry and the urban economy in Shanghai and Wuxi provided Wuxi peasants not only a new outlet for family surplus labor but also a potential higher income source at no cost of land. The motivation of peasants to leave the countryside for cities came on the one hand from population pressure on land and on the other hand from the attraction of the new labor market. Underlying the so-called “push and pull” factors was the propensity of peasant households to maximize family income by optimizing their factor allocation. The study concludes that despite small progress in agricultural technology and slow growth in grain output, the Wuxi rural economy of the late 19th and early 20 centuries underwent significant structural changes. With new factors introduced, peasants were not simply increasing labor input under the old agricultural structure, but were re-allocating their production factors and engaging in new occupations. The Wuxi rural economy had diverged from the long-term development pattern of the traditional Chinese agricultural economy.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, Agricultural economics, China, Economic opportunities, Household, Industrialization, International trade, Peasants, Urbanization, Wuxi",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

As the first modern bank in Japan, Daiichi Bank was the first Japanese bank to establish operations in the Korean open ports. Daiichi was heavily dependent on its business in Korea for survival, but it ultimately thrived within the fierce competition of the time. Daiichi also demonstrated the inherent contradiction of functioning as the erstwhile Korean central bank as well as a private commercial bank. After annexation in 1910, Daiichi Bank transferred nearly all of its operations into the Bank of Chōsen. The internal Japanese debate over the establishment of a stand-alone central bank between the Bank of Japan, Ministry of Finance, and colonial government established the Bank of Chōsen with a separate-but-equal yen currency which placed colonial Korea on the periphery and insulated Japan from the Korean economy. Also, the Bank of Chōsen aggressively expanded into Manchuria to remedy the colonial contradictions of a perpetual trade imbalance, but it also reinforced a new core-periphery relationship between colonial Korea and the Manchuria. The post-WWI economic crash, the 1923 Kanto Earthquake, and the 1927 Showa Financial Crisis presented new challenges for the Bank of Chōsen which was forced to rely on a government-sponsored rescue. After 1945, the Bank of Chōsen continued to play a pivotal role in the southern economy under American occupation authority. Despite the internal power struggle between the Bank of Chōsen and the Ministry of Finance over the creation and independence of the South Korean central bank, the prominence and authority of the Bank of Chōsen ensured continuity in the institution and personnel in the new Bank of Korea. The histories of Daiichi Bank, the Bank of Chōsen, and the Bank of Korea thus demonstrate the continuity and contingent adaptations of these institutions with the demands of the state as they traversed late nineteenth and early twentieth century Korea, Japan, and Manchuria.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,Asian Languages & Cultures 00A9,East Asian Studies,"History, Economic history, Bank of Chosen, China, Colonial Korea, Daiichi Bank, Japanese financial history, Korean financial history, Open ports Korea",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

These two economic activities became the major pillars of Weixian's local economy since the county was subsumed to Qingdao's trading system after the opening of Qingdao as a treaty port and the completion of the Qingdao-Jinan Railway. This study analyzes Weixian's modern economic system characterized by the symbiotic interrelationship between merchant capital and the small-scale peasant economy under the influence of foreign capitalism which manifested itself in the organization of the two major economic enterprises in the locale. Part One presents the background of Weixian's socioeconomic transformation since the late 19th century. Part Two and Part Three discuss in detail the production and marketing of tobacco leaf and handloom cloth respectively. As revealed in this dissertation, Weixian's local economic system signified a form of dependent and stagnant commercialization of agriculture and manufacture. While Japanese and British-American capital exerted considerable effect on the county's new economic activities, foreign factors did not change the existing production structure too much. As long as a great number of surplus population with low opportunity cost existed in the countryside and no technological breakthroughs were necessitated, the small peasant family would persist as the basic unit of production, providing merchants and foreign capitalists with cheap labor. Taking the advantage of the economical production system of the small family farms and facing keen competition from foreign enterprises, local merchants had little incentive to invest in the field of production. Although Weixian experienced increased commercialization in agriculture and its handicraft production proceeded to the putting-out stage in the 20th century, this change did not lead to a pervasive and dynamic development of capitalist farming and workshop or factory manufacture of textile products.",1988,1988,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, China",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
863572773,"Zeitz, Peter Jacob",Essays on Industrial Productivity in Twentieth Century China,Contemporary,"My dissertation identifies factors which led China's industrial productivity to lag behind that of other East Asian countries for most of the twentieth century. The dissertation is divided into three papers, each of which examines some facet of Chinese institutions or state policy which constrained productivity growth in industry. The first paper examines British and Japanese competition in the 1920s and 1930s Chinese textile industry. Pre-WWII Japan, particularly in its textile industry, succeeded in rapidly mastering industrial technologies, while other developing countries, such as China and India, struggled. To indentify factors which affect the ability of countries to borrow technology, I investigate British and Japanese attempts to transfer textile technologies to China. I find that Japanese-owned firms established efficient plants in China with total factor productivity levels similar to those in Japan, and approximately 80 percent higher than those of Chinese-owned firms. British-owned firms, by contrast, performed poorly even in comparison to domestically-owned firms. Japanese textile companies' superior performance was due to the application of Japanese methods of labor management which were effective in both China and Japan. Conversely, poor British performance is explained by their use of a British management system which performed exceptionally poorly in the presence of Chinese labor market institutions. The research shows that managerial knowledge is not necessarily transferable across countries, and that a shared institutional background can lead to more productive flows of knowledge. The second paper examines the effect of the 1978 introduction of managerial and worker incentives on productivity levels in Chinese state-owned enterprises. Previous studies have found that incentives increased effort levels and led to large increases in productivity, but have not investigated whether these increases persisted over time. This is important because creating strong incentives to increase short-run production could have encouraged managers and workers to neglect activities which contributed to long- run growth, such as investment, planning, and research. I collect a unique panel of compensation, employment, and output statistics covering all firms in the Chinese iron and steel industry and use this data to estimate short-run and long-run effects of incentive use on labor productivity. The results indicate that incentives had large negative effects on future labor productivity, and that, overall, they reduced the rate of labor productivity growth during the 1980s by about one-third. The third paper analyzes how closure of the foreign capital goods market affected industrialization in Communist China. During the 1950s, most capital equipment in China was imported from the Soviet Union, but due to a collapse in Sino-Soviet relations, China shifted to a near exclusive reliance on domestically produced equipment in the 1960s and 1970s. To investigate the effects of the closure of trade in capital goods, I collect sector-level data for 12 industries and plant-level data for the iron and steel industry and use these to estimate the relative productivity of capital goods of different vintages. I find that Soviet-produced machines installed during the 1950s were much more cost-effective than domestically-produced substitutes installed during the 1960s and 1970s. These effects are large, and, at least in the iron and steel industry, they appear to completely explain the decline in industrial performance which China experienced during the 1960s and 1970s.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, China, Imports, Industrial productivity, Industry, Productivity, Steel, Textiles",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

It examines the effect of frequent water calamities upon the rural economy of the Jianghan plain, the central basin of Hubei province, and the resulting changes in peasant behavior throughout the Qing (1644–1911) and the Republican eras (1912–1949). The dike systems in this plain had become an increasing important means to protect farmland from annual floods since the Ming (1368–1644), and more and more lakes were simultaneously being reclaimed as yuan (farmland circled by dikes) under increasing population pressure, which only served to exacerbate the water calamities. The expansion of yuan combined with frequent water calamities constantly changed the local environment, which in turn had a great effect upon the development of the local economy. The dissertation therefore emphasizes an ecological approach in which the multiple factors of population increase, state policies, community actions, market forces, and peasant choices, interact with the natural environment. I argue that, first, the frequent inundations in the Jianghan plain were due mainly to the weakness of dike management caused by state neglect, as well as poor local coordination. Second, the local peasants made sophisticated responses to an unstable environment, evidenced in extensive dike building, much reliance on fishing, and use of flood-resistant crops. Third, the natural environment played a more important role in shaping peasant economic behavior than market forces. The result demonstrates that society and economy on the Jianghan plain cannot be understood without taking into consideration these interactive ecological relationships.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, Environmental science, Agrarian, China, Economic growth, Environmental change, Jianghan plain, Peasant",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
303815973,"Cheng, Hong","The rural commodities market in the Yangzi Delta, 1920-1940: A social and economic analysis",Contemporary,"Rural commercialization in the Yangzi Delta during China's modernization was a paradoxical process, in which modern elements developed along with the involution of traditional factors. From the middle imperial period on, rural markets in the Delta expanded first with the reclamation of the area and then with the growth of local commodity production, and formed a local-based traditional market system. After the appearance of modern capitalism in China, a new process of commercialization powered by urban industrial development emerged, and finally met the traditional process at the Delta countryside. Rural markets became a meeting point of the traditional rural system with urban capitalism, the peasant household economy with modern challenges, and local communities with the outside world. Thus, the market system in the Yangzi Delta in fact comprised two sectors: the modern capitalist and the traditional non-capitalist. The rural production for urban and international markets made peasants' production more or less attached to modern capitalism, but rural consumption was still relied on traditional local markets. The rural-urban trade followed an one-way direction, and rural communities did not get necessary modern inputs from urban capitalist development as a return. As a result, rural life was still based on the traditional self-supplied local economy. Modern capitalism affected the rural market system mainly at its modern sector, but the force operating the rural markets was traditional commercial capital. Apart from its relationship with urban capitalism, the traditional commercial capital was closely connected with land ownership and usury. It played double roles, introducing some modern factors while obstructing the whole market system from capitalist development. Different from existing models, my studies emphasizes the multiplex feature of the system and the interactions between the modern and traditional sectors, which I believe is the key to understanding the role of rural markets in China's modernization.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, Social structure, China, commodities market, social analysis",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

This study draws primarily on previously untapped county archives to examine how the new system was implemented in village communities across Haicheng County, Fengtian Province from 1905–1931. It focuses on three overlapping areas of interest: the organization of Haicheng's village schools, the relationship of the schools to local society, and the interaction between local educational reform and national debates and regulations. Past works criticize the new school system for being too foreign for China's largely rural populace or, conversely, for being too mired in Confucianism to have any significant impact on rural society. This study argues that these critics have overlooked the significant efforts of central reformers, local government officials, and villagers to create viable institutions by blending old and new, traditional and modern, and Western and Chinese characteristics. In Haicheng's villages, hundreds of new “modern” schools combined a new curriculum, calendar, and teaching methods with old practices, in particular, an emphasis on the Confucian Classics. When resources were scarce, villages reformed old schools called sishu. Sishu retained many of their former ways while offering new classes and teaching methods. The result was a two-tiered system that accommodated a broad spectrum of society. This research also challenges past scholarship that maintains that early twentieth-century Chinese statebuilding engendered a hostile relationship between state and society when reforms were introduced to the village. This may have been the case in extractive areas like taxation, but in the area of education, where both state and village stood to benefit, a cooperative relationship developed. The state provided supervision, organizational guidance, and occasional subsidies. Village communities responded energetically to state demands to build schools. Although burdened financially, they exhibited creativity and ingenuity, combining different sources of funding and initiating partnerships with other villages to implement educational reform, thereby playing a key role in China's early twentieth-century modernization.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Education history, China, Educational reform, Haicheng County, Twentieth century, Village society",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
304582204,"Ben-Dor, Zvi","The “dao of Muhammad”: Scholarship, *education, and Chinese Muslim literati identity in late imperial China",Modern,"This dissertation is concerned with the Chinese Muslim literati elite of the early modern period. Through examination of the literatures put forth by this elite over the course of a century and a half (roughly 1600–1750) it demonstrates that the Chinese Muslim scholarly community was far-flung, well organized, and prolific. Most centrally, the study argues that the Chinese Muslim scholarly community of this period viewed itself specifically as consisting of “literati,” as that term was understood and deployed by dominant (i.e., Confucian) culture. Through study of the literatures of this elite—literatures that collectively are termed the “Han Kitab,” or “Chinese Books”—the dissertation thus puts forth two central claims. The first is that the Chinese Muslim scholarly community grew out of a systematized network of education, one that was spread throughout eastern China. The second is that the Chinese Muslim literati with which the study is concerned made use of—and expanded—the categories of dominant Chinese culture to make sense of themselves and their mission vis-a-vis that culture. The dissertation argues that the educational network was the crucible and the clearinghouse for the formation of one specific and distinct form of Chinese literati identity in the early modern period. Contra much traditional historiography on Chinese elites, this study suggests that highly-educated Chinese Muslims, like their Confucian counterparts, shared the dominant values of Chinese society at the time: dedication to tradition, devotion to one's sagely forebears, and commitment to the propagation and dissemination of scholarly knowledge. Through analysis of the vocabulary with which Chinese Muslim scholars configured Islam (by describing it as a “dao,” for example, and by understanding the prophet Muhammad as a “sage”), the dissertation highlights the ways in which the dominant categories of Chinese society were available and meaningful to Chinese Muslim scholars.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Education history, Science history, Religion, China, Chinese, Education, Han Kitab, Imperial, Islam, Literati, Muslim, Scholarship",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

This story, told from above, is one of government decrees, model schools and new curricula. The actual evolution of the modern education system in China is more complex and colorful, and the path more tortuous. It involved the reworking of a highly elaborate existing education system, and creating hybrid modern institutions. Moreover, the modernization of schools was an integral part of the traumatic transformation of local Chinese society, involving intense political struggles and cultural change. My dissertation tells a central part of this story—the development of Chinese teachers' education from 1897, when the first teachers' school was opened, until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937. Chinese teachers' schools were in some ways modeled after institutions in the West and Japan, but while other countries soon merged their teachers' schools into the regular education system, the Chinese system has been maintained up to the present, and developed its own characteristics. China's teachers' schools became a focal point of a dynamic process in which imported and domestic models of education were combined. Selected aspects of Western and Japanese models were adapted to Chinese political, cultural and social circumstances to create a type of school that played a mediating role between local values and Western culture and was more integrated into local society than other types of modern schools. Created as official tools of modernization, teachers' schools become an important arena of struggle between the state and local elites. Local elites also used these schools to consolidate their influence, both cooperating with and resisting state projects, while revolutionaries worked to convert them into bases for recruitment and mobilization for more radical projects. Teachers' schools also shaped chances for social mobility by including and excluding particular social groups. The history of teachers' schools shows a complicated and dramatic process that opened the doors of public education to women and provided them with a legitimate role in the public domain as professional teachers. These developments forever altered the position of women in Chinese society.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, History, School administration, China, Education reform, Modernization, Teachers' schools",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
1020617127,"Chang, Winifred Kai-wen",Marshaling Culture: Strategies of Japanese Mobilization in Colonial Taiwan,Contemporary,"In 1895, Japan annexed Taiwan, nominally ruled by China, and embarked on a period of expansion that only ceased at the end of World War II. Aside from military force, early colonial policies preserved Taiwanese lifestyles and sought the acceptance of Japanese rule. The colonial government administered cultural policies centered on sentimentality to remake Taiwanese people of aborigine and Han origin into Japanese citizens and imperial subjects amenable to mobilization. New standards of citizenship based on emotional affinity and sympathy were constructed for the Taiwanese, whose feelings and consequent actions became crucial for their positions in the empire. Japanese official documents, newspapers, and textbooks are evidence of Japanese manipulation of Taiwanese emotions and identity in order to motivate submission and collaboration. Martial ideals involving violence were broadly imparted through literacy and ethics. When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the colonial apparatus aimed to cultivate genuine self-effacing love for Japan, convertible into direct participation in the war effort by Taiwanese men, women, and children. Stories of patriotic emotional outbursts and moving though violent deaths were disseminated through schools and the press, perpetuating a focus on the empire despite wartime hardships increasingly troubling for the Taiwanese people in their everyday experiences. Generally, Japanese cultural strategies were more effective for Taiwanese born in the last three decades of Japanese rule. However, Japan could not completely harness Taiwanese emotions. Apart from patriotism, sources generated by Taiwanese people such as diaries and postwar oral histories demonstrate ambivalence, apathy, avoidance and pretense. This dissertation chronologically covers the five decades of Japanese rule on Taiwan through three sets of interrelated themes. The first is the paradigm shift in Japanese cultural policy from colonial expediency to wartime necessity. The second is the dialectical relationship between the cultural and the martial, exemplified by the power of education to effect mobilization. The third consists of the changing ideals and meanings of masculinity and femininity. This dissertation's focus on the emotional dimension of colonialism affirms individual experiences and agency, sees institutional power as contingent, and contributes to the study of Taiwanese and Japanese history, colonialism, and identity formation.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,History 0429,History,"History, Modern history, China, Colonialism, Emotions, Japan, Mobilization, Taiwan",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

Yet throughout this period, personal and public religious life have remained matters of highest importance. This dissertation combines traditional archival sources with the author's fieldwork to outline the religious needs and devotion of the individual, the history of local religious institutions and networks, and interaction between religious organization and local society in Cang County during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The dissertation begins with an analysis of personal religious mentality, asking how the individual comes to know the sacred and what he or she comes to expect of it. An analysis of religious vows ( yuan ) in the city of Tianjin and in rural Cang County demonstrates the place of morality and devotion in an overtly functional ritual regimen. The place of spirit healers ( xiangtou ) in Cang County, and their interaction with other healers, particularly village doctors, demonstrates both the contingency of belief and the characteristic manner by which religious knowledge is spread through the medium of miracle tales. Religious institutions generally did not demand exclusive belief or affiliation, and popular religiosity freely drew upon different sects and teachings as sources of inspiration. Formal teachings such as Buddhism made a great impact on local belief, but by the twentieth century, monks were few and their teaching nearly indistinguishable from local religiosity. Sectarian groups, long characterized as subversive and secret, also left an important mark on local religious life. Each teaching had distinct doctrine, organization and social appeal. some were oriented towards personal morality (Zailijiao), others addressed millenarian longings (Yiguandao), while still others were grounded in everyday ritual practice (Tiandimen, Taishangmen). Outside of religious networks, the organization of local society, and especially the village concentrated religious knowledge, which in turn, influenced the votive lives of individual peasants. However, although the village supported religious resources (such as temples and specialists) and expressed a sense of common welfare, the ritual use of these resources was primarily by the household.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Religion, Folklore, Cang County, China, Nineteenth century, Religion, Rural religion, Twentieth century",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
304689231,"Liao, Hsien-huei","Popular religion and the religious beliefs of the Song elite, 960–1276",Medieval,"This study explores the interaction between the elite and popular religion during the Song. Its central concern lies in the question of how concurrent intellectual and religious trends could have been reconciled within the culture of the Song elite. My main contention is that rather than dissociating themselves from the supernatural realm or making genuine efforts to put it under control, many of the Song elite like the rest of the society upheld a deep-rooted belief in the power of the supernatural world. Yet due to their unique social, cultural, and political status, the beliefs and practices of the Song elite were not exactly identical to those of the common people. Implicit divergences of beliefs and practices between the elite and the common people remained abiding features underneath their commonly shared beliefs. The Song elite significantly contributed to the development and proliferation of popular religion through their personal piety and patronage. To demonstrate the above argument, this study will examine four key aspects of the elite's religious beliefs and practices: their appeals for divine aid, encounters with ghosts and demonic forces, obsession with death and the afterlife, and recourse to divination. Why they believed in supernatural powers, how they justified personal actions violating Confucian principles, and what reactions they made to supernatural interventions will all be closely investigated through their own testimonies and daily practices. By examining the religious views and actions of the elite in both the public and private spheres, this dissertation attempts to develop a new perspective for the study of the religious life and role of the elite and a novel conception of the formation and development of popular religion.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Religious history, Beliefs, China, Elite, Popular religion, Religious, Song dynasty",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

Special attention is paid to how these four Confucian scholars constructed social boundaries between the Chinese and the Westerners in their astronomical discourses and how they domesticated Western astronomy in order to fit the Chinese cultural conditions situated in the power structure built by the Manchus. This inquiry begins with a brief introduction of Wan-nan and the Wan-nan school. I then discuss how the Jesuits legitimated their knowledge during the Ming-Ch'ing transition, and how Jesuit astronomy was situated within the power nexus between the Confucian literati and the emperors. The next chapter focuses on Yang Kuang-hsien and his challenges to the Jesuits. I examine his strategies and the power structure in which Yang carried out his challenge to the Jesuits. The fourth and fifth chapters investigate how Mei Wen-ting restructured the relationship between Confucianism and astronomy. The former chapter focuses on Mei's social networking and his ambivalence towards the Ming and Ch'ing dynasties, on the one hand, and towards Chinese and Western learning on the other. The latter chapter deals with how Mei Wen-ting recast Chinese astronomical tradition and Confucianism. In the sixth chapter, I will compare the fame of Chiang Yung and Tai Chen in order to demonstrate how astronomy was practiced in evidential studies after Mei Wen-ting, and how evidential studies itself conveyed an ideological construction of the other. Through integrating Western astronomy with indigenous tradition while exorcising the otherness contained within the cultural package of Western astronomy combined with Christianity, these Wan-nan scholars had successfully rejuvenated a Chinese astronomical tradition compatible with their own culture.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Science history, Astronomy, Astrophysics, China",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
305218668,"Hu, Minghui",Cosmopolitan Confucianism: China's road to modern science,Contemporary,"This dissertation shows the centrality of scientific issues in the history of late imperial China. It engages issues of comparative history, trans-cultural contacts and exchange, and mobility of knowledge. I focus on three major regions in China (the court in the north China plain, lower Yangzi delta, and Canton in the south) between 1680 and 1820, and investigate a specific intellectual and cultural fusion of science and classicism as part of the elite mentality that had taken form by the end of eighteenth-century in China. The value-creating elites in eighteenth-century China relentlessly reconstructed and reinvented the physical cosmos, and sought political and social legitimacy seeking sanction for their scientific views in the Classics. I call this process the emergence of cosmopolitan Confucianism, a movement that can be further decomposed into two intertwined subprocesses. The first part is the state-driven enterprise to appropriate Jesuit cosmography, trigonometry, algebra, and global geography. the second part is the gentry-led resistance leading subsequently to the reconstruction of this body of foreign knowledge into domesticable form and content. The Qing state monopolized the formative phase of cosmopolitan Confucianism by appropriating Jesuit science into the state apparatus. The gentry-merchant alliance in the lower Yangzi basin initiated the second phase of cosmopolitan Confucianism by promoting a specific vision of classical interpretation. The development of cosmopolitan Confucianism culminated around 1820 and then declined, on the eve of the second wave of the protestant import of industrial science into China.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Science history, China, Confucianism, Cosmopolitanism, Jesuits, Science",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

It focuses on the wartime capital of Chongqing, discussing the work of local and national state administrations: the Chongqing Bureau of Public Health, the Central Institute of National Medicine, the National Health Administration, and the Sichuan Provincial Health Administration. It illustrates continuities in Nationalist Party policies between the Nanjing Decade (1927-37) and the Chongqing years (1938-45), and argues that non-local health officials attempted to re-fashion the Sichuan city in the image of coastal Nanjing or Shanghai, while failing to take adequate account of local conditions. This dissertation emphasizes that the war produced new opportunities as well as social upheaval. Health officials expanded their services into interior provinces, drawing them into the Chinese nation. medical researchers and scientists collaborated in innovative studies. medical reformers secured a place for Chinese medicine in the wartime and post-war state administration. and wartime public health administration served as the sturdy scaffolding upon which the Communist and Taiwanese states constructed their medical systems in the post-war years. This dissertation also analyzes public health as an expression of social values, with particular attention to gender. The war created new opportunities for women to participate in the world of medicine, as both patients and professionals, while also reifying gender hierarchies and gender-bound notions of citizenship. China's hybrid medical system—a unique combination of scientized Chinese medicine and indigenized biomedicine—solidified during the war, while the national emergency forced the state to utilize the skills of Chinese medicine practitioners, thereby giving them greater professional footing. At the same time, the pressing needs of the war era, increasing dialogue about state medicine, the advent of sulfa drugs and penicillin, and military and charitable assistance from abroad all contributed to a higher profile for scientific biomedicine during the war.

Differentiations within the working class are generally considered a later development of industrial society rather than something that happened in the very beginning. This study, however, found that in Republican-era Shanghai, differentiation occurred at the time when the working class was beginning to form. Shanghai's workers were a highly stratified social group, comprised of some who rose to the status of what were called the little urbanites (xiaoshimin), and others who fell to the very bottom of society. Most workers were first-generation immigrants from China's rural hinterland. They varied greatly to native place, family background, level of education, personal connections in the city, etc.. Different industries, different types of occupations and different statuses of employment created different earning power among workers. Factors such as division of labor, local origins, income levels and residential communities played crucially important roles in creating stratifications within the workers before a socially identifiable and politically united working class ever emerged. Hence Shanghai's workers had vastly different life styles, standards of living (particularly, residential patterns), interests and values. Differentiation along these lines fragmented the working class at the time of its very formation.

304857979,"McDonald, Kathryn Alexia Merkel-Hess",A new people: Rural modernity in Republican China,Contemporary,"The renewed interest in the countryside among Chinese intellectuals in the 1920s and 1930s resulted in dozens of Rural Reconstruction projects. Reformers from diverse backgrounds addressed rural problems through reform and outreach, sharing ideas for a remade Chinese countryside in the growing popular press. As rural reformers moved to rural areas, they confronted the systemic problems that plagued rural China. Though the reforms were grounded in literacy education, reformers quickly realized that they could accomplish little in the face of physical insecurity, endemic poverty, and poor health. Careful study of rural conditions led reformers to conclude that while foreign reform ideas might have value, they needed to be Sinified to be useful in rural China. In the mid-1930s, rural reconstruction advocates built national organizations like the Rural Work Discussion Society and established regional centers like the Provincial Institutes for Social and Political Reconstruction. Their efforts, particularly to develop a model for county self-government, resonated with a well developed strain in Chinese political thought that championed the role of local elites in directing local governance. Meanwhile, the Nanjing government grew concerned about local factionalism and rural revolution. In the emerging national Rural Reconstruction Movement, the Guomindang (GMD) government saw a potential model for rural change and the GMD's resulting rural reconstruction projects attempted to seize on the national excitement the movement had generated over localist rural reform. While the movement as well as individual projects had weaknesses, the GMD's high-profile rural reconstruction efforts coupled with the Japanese invasion of North China spelled a precipitous end for the movement. This work traces the path of the most prominent failed effort at rural reform in early twentieth China, a moment when we know rural revolution was a possibility for China. There were multiple factors in the Rural Reconstruction Movement's failure to become a national program for rural change, but this work posits that one of the critical factors was the tension between the movement's support for nation-building and the local emphasis of individual reform projects.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Social structure, China, Literacy, Mass education, Modernity, Rural Reconstruction Movement, Rural reform, Self-governance",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
1424274038,"Apter, Norman D.",Saving the Young: A History of the Child Relief Movement in Modern China,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the development of child welfare in twentieth-century China, and interprets those developments within the context of China's long history. The first chapter traces government efforts to provide support for indigent or abandoned children from the Southern Song Dynasty in the 13 th century CE to the early Republican era in the 20th century. The Song government provided grain and other forms of assistance to destitute families and encouraged the adoption of abandoned children. Such initiatives were abandoned after the collapse of the Song dynasty, and revived only in the early Qing dynasty. In the Qing, however, members of a newly formed merchant-gentry elite took the lead in providing relief for foundlings. the Qing state encouraged these works through the provision of supplementary monetary support and honorary plaques. Government relief efforts were intensified and broadened after the devastation accompanying the Taiping upheaval in the mid-19 th century. Thereafter, reformers began to focus greater attention on education and life skills, a trend that intensified in the 1910s and '20s when government officials and private activists endeavored to turn poor and indigent children into healthy and productive modern citizens. Chapter 2 traces child relief efforts in Shanghai during the Republican period. Rapid urbanization and the growing disparity between rich and poor motivated Chinese officials, business leaders, education reformers as well as Western expatriates to organize relief efforts and vocational educational opportunities for dependent children. State-private collaboration continued in supporting homes for abandoned infants, poor and orphaned children, and street urchins. Private institutions dominated relief work throughout the period, but the Republican government became increasingly involved in coordinating and supervising relief efforts after establishing the Social Affairs Bureau in 1930. Police and public health officials worked together to improve neonatal services for the destitute, to discourage child abandonment and infanticide, and to place street urchins in homes and give them vocational training. Chapter 3 concentrates on the impact of the Sino-Japanese war from 1937 to 1945 on government and private child welfare programs. The sheer numbers of displaced persons and warphans compelled the state and civic leaders to organize and coordinate relief efforts on a far greater scale than ever before. Relief efforts were combined with educational services to train poor and destitute children in the hope of transforming them into useful and public-minded modern citizens. Chapter 4 analyzes the intensification of Republican-era trends in the Maoist period (1949-1976), as the state created a hierarchy of welfare management agencies permeating society down to the county level. The state coordinated all communications media and a series of mass campaigns with the goal of transforming parentless children and homeless youths into healthy, loyal, hard-working, and productive citizens. During the New Democracy period (1949-1953) some private agencies continued to function but under increasing government supervision and coordination. From 1956 onward all private institutions were closed or subsumed by state-run organizations. The concluding chapter 5 analyzes the evolution of child relief efforts in the Post-Mao era. The closed centrally coordinated system of child relief of previous decades has given way to an open-ended multifocal support structure during the course of the Reform Period (1978 - present). The demise of the guaranteed employment of the Maoist era, and the one-child policy, have resulted in a rapid increase in the number of abandoned children, and China's opening to the outside world has led to a broader definition of those deserving support, and given rise to an emphasis on local initiative and experimentation. Throughout the 1980s, China's state-managed facilities continued to employ a regimen of caregiving and youth training that had become the nationwide standard by the early 1960s. But Civil Affairs authorities as well as domestic and international civic organizations new to the scene have since broken from this mold, pursuing a multiplicity of approaches to target the various developmental deficiencies – physiological, mental, social, emotional, etc. – of their charges. In conjunction with the embrace of multi-approachism, we can observe a paradigmatic shift within China's child welfare sector from institution-based rearing toward family-centered care. As China entered the 21 st century, a growing commitment among child relief practitioners to the notion that a family setting was best suited to foster the dependent child's development was reshaping the field of care in a significant way for the first time since the welfare system was established in the mid-1950s.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,History 0429,History,"History, Social work, Public policy, Abandoned children, Child relief movement, China",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
1771705885,"Wu, Hsiao-Chun",Ascending the Hall of Great Elegance: The Emergence of Drama Research in Modern China,Contemporary,"This dissertation captures a critical moment in China’s history when the interest in opera transformed from literati divertissement into an emerging field of scholarly inquiry. Centering around the activities and writings of Qi Rushan (1870-1962), who played a key role both in reshaping the modes of elite involvement in opera and in systematic knowledge production about opera, this dissertation explores this transformation from a transitional generation of theatrical connoisseurs and researchers in early twentieth-century China. It examines the many conditions and contexts in the making of opera—and especially Peking opera—as a discipline of modern humanistic research in China: the transnational emergence of Sinology, the vibrant urban entertainment market, the literary and material resources from the past, and the bodies and identities of performers. This dissertation presents a critical chronology of the early history of drama study in modern China, beginning from the emerging terminology of genre to the theorization and the making of a formal academic discipline. Chapter One examines the genre-making of Peking Opera in three overlapping but not identical categories: temporal, geographical-political, and aesthetic. It argues that it is within the context of emerging theatrical genres and heated debates on drama in early twentieth-century China that a “researcher mode” of theatrical appreciation became meaningful for Qi Rushan and his contemporaries. Chapter Two and Three study the link between the urban theater and the emergence of modern drama research in China. Chapter Two examines from a material point of view how studies on China’s native theater were shaped by the local conditions of Republican Beijing. It investigates how the city’s well-established cultural market, unique thriving opera scene, and long-standing performing community fueled the collecting of theatrical materials, thereby providing a solid basis of research artifacts in the transnational competition for texts and things pertinent to Sinological studies. Chapter Three explores the urban theater from the production side and revises the assumption of a linear temporal sequence between theatrical knowledge and production with attention to the local conditions (audiences preferences and entertainment fashion) of the site where the theatrical art develops. It shows that Mei Lanfang’s signatures plays were responding to contemporary market trends rather than being the materialization of any pre-existing aesthetic ideas. It was not until these productions were translated to contexts different from the entertainment market in 1910s and 1920s China that they came to be identified as illustration of an aesthetic representing Chinese theatrical art. Chapter Four examines the formation and transition of theatrical knowledge through discussion of two kinds of performer education: for career actors and for amateurs. The discussion on education for career actor uncovers a tension between aspiration for full-rounded preparation and the economic and social restraints encountered, while the controversies surrounding amateur performers were windows onto the identity-claims of insiders and outsiders to the performing business. This chapter shows that it was in the course of contemporaneous discussions on what and how to learn about opera performance that the scope and content of theatrical knowledge came into shape. Chapter Five discusses Qi Rushan’s effort to stabilize an understanding of Chinese theatrical art by writing a history of Chinese opera with textual resources from Chinese antiquity and the early imperial dynasties. It shows how Qi theorized Chinese opera with the constructed gewu—song-and-dance—notion and how he depicted an unbroken genealogy of the Chinese performance tradition dating from the ancient period to recent times. For Qi, gewu was the guiding principle to connect the past and present of Chinese theater and to make an aesthetic that attested to the superiority of Chinese theatrical art. The concluding chapter reflects the irony of knowledge production about an art form dislocated from its native place and ponders the links between the birth of a scholarship and the loss of the thing being studied. Reviewing Qi Rushan’s immigrant years on Taiwan after he moved there in 1947, it argues that the “geographical” rupture due to the Chinese Civil War engendered new incentives to nationalize the interest in opera in service of the party-state. When theatrical connoisseurs and researchers relocated to Taiwan because of the loss of their homeland, their indulgence in opera was finally accepted as “elegant.”",2016,2016,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,History 0429,History,"History, Theater History, Beijing, Chinese opera, Drama research, Qi Rushan, Republican China, Urban theater",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
304687761,"Lien, Ling-ling","Searching for the “new womanhood”: Career women in Shanghai, 1912–1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation will examine a group of career women in Shanghai to explore the social and cultural implications of changes in women's economic roles in Republican China (1912–1949). New opportunities for education and employment allowed women to work outside the home, which reshaped their gender identity as well as the expectations of proper women's roles by the state and society. This dissertation first discusses the emergence of the new social group: career women—Who were they? Why did they seek employment outside the home? In what ways were they empowered by their paid jobs? As a new social phenomenon, the emergence of career women also caused heated debates about the “new woman” in modern China. Believing that the “new woman” should contribute to maintaining social order, the Nationalist government and some social reformers promoted the idea of “healthy motherhood” in which women were expected to play the roles of home caretakers from whom the future generations of the nation benefited. However, others defined the “new woman” as those who received modern education and pursued independent careers in light of women's emancipation from the bondage of family obligations. And even the “healthy mother,”—though considered a relatively traditional image of the new woman—was in fact very different from the domestic heroine of late imperial times. The image of the “new woman” became further complicated when she was confused with an allegedly frivolous urban woman, the so-called “modern girl,” who wasted her energies and the nation's resources on consumption. The debates over the “new woman” then reflected social anxiety about gender roles, national strength, and consumption and production in changing times. Finally, this dissertation also discusses career women's culture networks. Participation in leisure activities not only allowed career women to have a break from the stresses of their work, but also broadened their social connections and created a cultural space in which they could assert their own concerns. Although the government often called on women to abandon “selfish” feminist claims, career women gave priority to their rights as women over nationalist slogans. This study thus reformulates the relationships between nationalism and feminism in China. Despite an overwhelming sentiment during the war, nationalism did not necessarily overshadow feminist rights. rather, feminist interests, as career women claimed, were the paramount concerns.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, Career women, China, Gender roles, Leisure, New woman, Shanghai",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
275771307,"Lean, Eugenia Y.",Politics of passion: The trial of Shi Jianqiao and the rise of public sympathy in nineteen -thirties China,Contemporary,"My dissertation examines the political significance of “sentiment” ( qing ) in nineteen-thirties China through a study of the trial of Shi Jianqiao, a woman who assassinated warlord Sun Chuanfang to avenge her father's death. By examining this highly sensational case, it demonstrates how a single act of virtuous female passion gave rise to the unprecedented moral and political authority of “public sympathy” ( tongqing ). In imperial China, exemplary women often served as symbols of certain human sentiments that were thought to take moral precedent over imperial law. What my dissertation shows is that such virtuous emotions, often embodied by women, not only continued to exert political influence in the twentieth-century, but also assumed an unprecedented collective form. “Public sympathy” represented a new “public” based not on an ideal of modern rationality but on a long-standing premise of the moral authenticity of emotions and arose not through critical discussions in coffeehouses and salons, but through the consumption of media sensation surrounding dramatic court trials featuring passionate women. This public emotion was not only gendered, but also politicized. In a period when much of China was attempting to leave a preceding warlord era of lawlessness behind, public sympathy for the vigilante female assassin cast serious doubt upon both the reforming judicial system and the centralizing state's attempts to achieve national control. My dissertation not only touches on the question of China's modern “public,” but also sheds light on the less familiar issues of the political significance of emotions, the impact of media sensation on state and society relations, the contest over modern judicial reform, and the cultural exploration of warlord violence in a post-warlord decade. The rise of a sympathy-based “public” had implications beyond the thirties, serving as a key antecedent to the notion of the “sentiment of the revolutionary masses,” a force that proved so tragically powerful in post-1949 politics.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, History, China, Gender, Public sympathy, Shi Jianqiao, Trial",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States

Evidential research and authorship in late Qianlong era China (1771–1795),Modern,"Using a framework of the “dialectic between imposition and appropriation” articulated by Roger Chartier, the dissertation examines authorship in the Sikuquanshu , the bibliography and collectanea produced by Chinese officials under the auspices of the Qianlong emperor between 1771 and 1795. The study has two parts, which consider authorship in its complementary aspects. The first part investigates the cultural and administrative context for the production of the Sikuquanshu before-the-book summaries ( shuqian tiyao ), i.e., the Sikuquanshu bibliographers as authors within a Qing bureaucratic environment. The second part explores the before-the-book summaries to determine how the summary writers viewed the authorship participants who were responsible for the literary works in the bibliography, i.e., the author as constructed by the bibliographers as readers. Through a review of historical evidence, the first part of the study makes a distinction between the Sikuquanshu as process and product, seeking to identify the officials within the Sikuquanshu office who composed the bibliographic summaries. Major findings of Part I are that composition of the Sikuquanshu summaries can be localized within three groups of officials in the Sikuquanshu office. and that before-the book summaries, in the Sikuquanshu collectanea were composed and revised in an iterative process that was not strictly rationalized by bureaucratic routines.

89178493,"Cheng, Tieniu","Subversion, creation, and interaction a study of Chen Hengzhe",Contemporary,"My dissertation studies Chen Hengzhe (1890-1976), an American educated Chinese woman, who actively participated in the New Culture Movement and wrote a number of vernacular short stories, poems, essays, and cultural criticism. Her vernacular short story, “One Day” (Yiri, 1917), was one of the earliest vernacular short stories in modern China. Despite Chen's singular achievements, her career, writings, and thoughts have not been extensively explored in mainstream Chinese studies. My dissertation is partially a historical study. On top of this, I try to combine social-historical approaches with approaches in Gender studies, Woman studies, New Critics, and so on. My research focuses on Chen's autobiography, literary works, and the interactions between Chen and several leading male intellectuals. My study demonstrates that Chen consciously challenged and subverted traditional gender roles and literary conventions through a multitude of textual strategies. More remarkably, she made systematic efforts to construct a modern femininity. My research also indicates that as a May-Fourth writer, Chen was enthusiastic about the experiments in new literary forms. Her explorations in various genres, textual strategies, and themes display an inclination to dissociate her writings from Chinese cultural and literary tradition. By doing so, Chen endeavored to create a new writing style for modern women. My dissertation also studies the topic of the marginalization of women's writings in the literary criticism of the 1920s and 1930s. Through closely examining the interactions between Chen and several leading male intellectuals such as Hu Shi, my research demonstrates that Chen skillfully handled her doubly marginalized position as a female member of the liberal group. Thus, she not only gained support from them and access to important intellectual journals, but also exerted considerable influence on the intellectual circle in terms of key cultural debates and issues in national affairs. Through Chen's case, my research illustrates the complexity of the interactions between male and female intellectuals in modern China. In short, through the study of Chen's life and writings, my dissertation seeks to contribute to a broader and more complex picture of women's education, liberation, active writings, gender relationships as well as intellectual history of modern China.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Modern literature, Asian literature, History, Chen, Hengzhe, China, New Culture Movement, Women writers",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
304497018,"Shen, Vivian","The origins of left-wing cinema in China, 1932-1937",Contemporary,"Left-wing cinema dominated the Chinese silver screen for over fifty years, longer than in any other country in the world. This dissertation examines the origins of this cinema through reviewing films produced from 1932 to 1937 in China, an era known as the Left-wing Chinese Film Movement. By analyzing representative films, popular film reviews, and the various declarations, manifestoes and statements made by left-wing filmmakers during the 1930s, I argue that left-wing filmmaking, the dominant Chinese school in the 1930s, involved a potent combination of social reform and nationalist politics. In the 1910s and 1920s Chinese filmmakers were preoccupied with the economic rules of the game and the perceived need to turn out works of entertainment for the market place. But by the 1930s, when filmmaking achieved a definite maturity in China. an increasingly vocal group of socially conscious filmmakers felt that they could no longer treat filmmaking as a mere artistic practice when the nation was facing the social disruptions and undeniable crises caused by the constant threat of Japanese imperialism. The left-wing film movement was a response to the call to “save the nation” after the Japanese seizure of Manchuria in 1931. From this point on, Chinese filmmakers used carefully crafted language and images to redefine the function of Chinese cinema. Their films focused on tensions in gender relations, problems in countryside and city under foreign capitalism and imperialism, and the responsibilities between self and society. In so doing, they revealed a historical reality of the 1930s and called for ways to better society and country. This dissertation takes a cultural studies approach to analyze and account for the ways in which questions related to film, literature, cultural production, ideology, social change and modernity were raised in the left-wing film movement of the 1930s. Few would disagree that the 1930s was the most important moment in the formative age of Chinese filmmaking, and that leftist films were the dominant school in China, but we still have no English-language book length study of the topic.

304497517,"Berry, Christopher Allen","Towards a postsocialist cinema: The representation of the Cultural Revolution in films from the People's Republic of China, 1976-1981",Contemporary,"This dissertation seeks to determine whether the cycle of films produced after the Fall of the Gang of Four in the People's Republic of China in 1976 and representing events during the Cultural Revolution decade of 1966 to 1976 constitutes a major break with the classical mainland Chinese cinema that had been dominant in that country after 1949. It is widely acknowledged in scholarship about China that Chinese society and culture now is qualitatively different from the heyday of socialism, both in terms of a decline in central control and loss of faith in the socialist vision. This dissertation understands this new culture as postsocialist, and therefore asks if these films constitute the earliest sustained manifestation of postsocialist cinema. An institutional and textual analysis of the main features of the classical mainland Chinese cinema is carried out as part of the dissertation. It determines this cinema to be pedagogical and details its features. The examination of the corpus films proceeds through consideration of themes, characters, narrative structure and spectatorial engagement. It finds that themes are increasingly separate from the concerns of the Party-state apparatus, and that lead characters are increasingly distanced from this apparatus. Finally, it notes that in the final years of the cycle of films composing the corpus, these tendencies are consolidated into pattern where the films are about both romance and family bonds. The Party-state apparatus is positioned as the interrupter of these bonds, and the pedagogical spectatorial engagement of the classical cinema is replaced with an emphasis on empathetic sharing of suffering and construction of peer group bonds that are counter culture in being defined against the hierarchical structures of the pedagogical cinema. Therefore, the dissertation concludes that these films are indeed the earliest sustained manifestation of a postsocialist cinema in the People's Republic of China.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Motion Pictures, History, China, Cinema, Cultural Revolution, Postsocialist, Representation",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
902183231,"Koh, Seunghak",Li Tongxuan's (635–730) Thought and His Place in the Huayan Tradition of Chinese Buddhism,Pre-modern,"This dissertation explores diverse facets of the Chinese Huayan tradition by analyzing the thought of the lay exegete Li Tongxuan (635–730). Although Li's ideas have been considered idiosyncratic and even heterodox from the standpoint of the orthodox five Huayan patriarchs, we should not restrict our perspective to this narrow framework. As a lay scholar who had a strong practical orientation, Li had a solid literary background in indigenous Chinese philosophy and applied this knowledge to the explication of the newly translated eighty-fascicle Flower Garland Sūtra ( Dafangguang fo huayan jing , Avatamsaka-sūtra ). Thus his exegesis is characterized by practicality and concreteness on the one hand and marked by originality and intuitiveness on the other hand. Because he has firm faith in the identity between the Buddha's wisdom and sentient beings' ignorance, he opposes artifice that aims at escaping from the mundane realm. For him, the realm of enlightenment is not differentiated from that of delusion. Based on this insight into the one true dharma realm ( yi zhen fajie ), Li criticizes the gradual approach to enlightenment and upholds the notion of the simultaneity of cause and effect. In order to account for our present state of ignorance, however, he defines the foundation of sentient beings, namely, the immovable wisdom ( budong zhi ), as devoid of intrinsic nature. Due to the elusive and flexible nature of wisdom, sentient beings are not aware that they are endowed with buddha-nature but can aspire for enlightenment when they encounter the condition of suffering. Just as the immovable wisdom that has no intrinsic nature is considered to depend upon the condition of suffering, the dharma-body is understood to resort to the great wishes and vows for its manifestation. Thus he emphasizes the role of dedication (Skt. parinamana ) in Buddhist practice and puts the greatest value on bodhisattvas' salvific activities in the mundane realm. In his exegesis the final chapter of the Flower Garland Sutra is understood to exemplify his thesis that buddhahood may be attained in a single lifetime. Li's doctrinal-classification schemata serve to assure the practitioners of this subitist vision. The ten teachings and the ten themes enumerated in his doctrinal-classification schemata are summarized into the pair of the true teaching and the provisional teachings. Whereas the provisional teachings relegate buddhahood to a remote realm, the true teaching clarifies the non-dual nature of delusion and enlightenment and upholds the prospect of sudden awakening. Therefore, he directs his criticisms to scriptures that deny the aseity of the present human condition. Li's correlative thinking and his Sinitic interpretation of the scripture are also predicated on this vision of the one true dharma realm, in which the distinction between the spatial realms of China and India no longer applies. Thus he discloses the religious dimensions underlying the directional and numerical references of the scripture by referring to a specifically Chinese framework. Besides this originality in the interpretation of the scripture, contemplation of gem-like radiance ( baose guangming guan ) demonstrates the concreteness of his soteriology, in which practitioners experience sudden expansion of their minds and realize the dharma realm that is united with their own minds. While Kojima Taizan takes note of these peculiarities in presenting his thesis of a different Huayan lineage on Mt. Wutai, I suggest here that it is rather hasty to place Li in the Mt. Wutai tradition. Although Li was forgotten for several decades after his death, his thought and practice were widely accepted later by Chinese Linji Chan masters and lay Buddhists. His ideas also inspired the scholar-monks of Korea and Japan who had a strong practical orientation. Scholars have revealed how his philosophy and soteriology affected these later developments, but left unexplored many other facets of Li's thought and practice. This dissertation is an effort to address the overall structure of Li's ideas and to determine his place in the East Asian Buddhist tradition.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Religion, Religious history, History, Philosophy, Avatamsaka-Sutra, Buddhism, China, Huayan, Lay Buddhism, Li, Tongxuan",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
902025372,"Kim, Minku",The Genesis of Image Worship: Epigraphic Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China,Pre-modern,"Image worship was not an institutionalized ritual practice in early China. Nor was there an unbroken sculptural tradition of representing religious figures as autonomous three-dimensional images. As a result of the Buddhist influx from Kusan India, this began to change. In this dissertation, I offer a new understanding of the process by which the alien ethnic practice of image worship became a part of mainstream Chinese culture. Chapter 1 lays out the basic problems, justifies the need for sociological modeling of the koineization process by which images became part of the Chinese cultural repertoire, and highlights pre-Buddhist social disapproval of the cult image. Chapter 2 questions the Buddhist connection of a certain group of artistic motifs that have been customarily associated with Buddhism, such as the lotus, elephants, etc. This iconographic reassessment aims to widen our perspectives of the material culture of early imperial China within an appropriate Eurasian context. In a similar vein, Chapter 3 focuses on the Kus an-derived anthropomorphic motifs found in Han- to Jin-period tombs, highlighting that they were distributed in only a few select regions in contrast to Buddhist devotional images that are almost wholly absent from the contemporary archeological record. After reviewing on the mechanics of artistic diffusion in the period, I offer a critique both of the hypothesis regarding the route of transmission and Buddho-Daoist hybridism. So as to complement the lack of devotional images in the archaeological record, Chapter 4 engages with epigraphic data of the Three Kingdoms and Western Jin periods. Because these documents were collected by antiquarian epigraphers whose worldview differs from our own, I seek to establish a working methodology that will enable us to make use of these traditional materials for the purposes of our analysis, and to reevaluate social conditions in the third century as a prelude to the rise of Buddhist art in the following centuries. As a conclusion, Chapter 5 outlines the innovative results that are brought about by this synthesis of scientific archaeology and traditional epigraphy, and suggests prospective approaches to the Chinese culture of images as a complex social phenomenon.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Religious history, Archaeology, History, Art history, Antiquarianism, Art, Buddhism, China, Image worship, Inscriptions, Monastic historiography, Six Dynasties",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
275690963,"Keyworth, George Albert, III",Transmitting the lamp of learning in classical Chan Buddhism: Juefan Huihong (1071–1128) and literary Chan,Medieval,"Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) Chinese Chan Buddhists did not abandon the written word. They were experts in language and letters. Even though the Chan/So˘n/Zen tradition of East Asian Buddhism is best known for its pithy sayings, enigmatic diagrams, and idiosyncratic gestures or shouts, the most influential monks of this lineage could compose stunning verse on a scroll, were learned in the Buddhist sūtra literature, and spent much of their time preaching to powerful lay patrons. Juefan Huihong (1071–1128) was one of these monks. Not only did he compile several influential Chan chronicles including the Chanlin sengbao zhuan (Chronicles of the Samgha Jewel within the Forests of Chan) and Linjian lu (Anecdotes from the Groves [of Chan]), and become an expert on the Śūramgamasūtra and Chinese poetics, but he accomplished these endeavors over the course a lifetime spent in and out of prison or exile because of his connections with powerful patrons. This study examines the role of learning and language in the classical Chan school to demonstrate the significance of the cultural context within which Chan came to dominate Chinese Buddhism. The case of Juefan Huihong and his literary Chan shows that concentration on accurate language was a cornerstone of Chan practice that developed from Buddhist and indigenous Chinese positions which culminated in the synthesis between the teachings of Fenyang Shanzhao (947–1024) and Fayan masters who lived around Mount Lu in Jiangxi province during the late-Tang (618–907) through Northern Song dynasties. Gongan (kōan) literature and meditations on the cases grew from the teachings of Fenyang's disciples. Simultaneously, Chan monks also began to compose poetry in abundance as poetry and thinking about poetry became an especially important aspect of Chinese Chan Buddhism. Huihong was an exceptional Chan monk in this regard because he was an expert on poetics and composed two treatises on poetic criticism—the Lengzhai yehua (Evening Discourses from a Cold Studio) and Tianchu jinluan (Forbidden Cutlets from the Imperial Kitchen)—as well as a renowned poet. In addition to these subjects, this study also examines the legacies of Huihong and his literary Chan in late-medieval China and Japan.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Asian literature, Chan Buddhism, China, Juefan Huihong, Learning, Poetry, Song dynasty",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
880294114,"Wing, Sherin Hah-Ying Horton","Re-Gendering Buddhism: Postcolonialism, Gender, and the Princess Miaoshan Legend",Contemporary,"Buddhology frequently configures monastic, androcentric practices and texts as normative and canonical. Women's Buddhism, by contrast, is often relegated to special studies. I will study these constructions, as well as recent discursive responses to them through the Chinese Buddhist narrative, the Legend of Princess Miaoshan. I explore the specific methodologies privileged not just in Buddhology, but in the discourses on the Princess Miaoshan Legend. Both have been dominated by Eurocentric and androcentric methodologies and theoretical biases. I reconsider how political, economic, and social forces have shaped both the Princess Miaoshan Legend and its discourses by combining Postcolonial and Feminist critiques with Historiography and Buddhology. I demonstrate that the narrative's religious themes significantly resemble those of men's hagiographies, most notably that of Prince Siddhartha. In so doing I reinterpret the Princess Miaoshan Legend as a narrative neither about nor addressed to women. instead it is a chronicle that reflects the values and agendas of men like the author himself: educated and socially elite. The legend thus functions both as a cautionary tale about women that reinforces androcentric, monastic Buddhism. As such, I propose that the primary audience of the Princess Miaoshan Legend was men, not women. Moreover the audience surrogate in the narrative was King Zhuangyan, not Princess Miaoshan. I further demonstrate that using different historiographical and theoretical models reveals the androcentricity of many narratives on idealized women, and that in truth Chinese female icons like Princess Miaoshan are men dressed as women. Indeed, I argue that equating gender studies with women's studies limits our understanding of Chinese secular and religious texts on women. Finally, I propose that every interpretation is invested and value-laden, rather than objective and value-free. My goal is to re-configure the way Chinese women's narratives and women's Buddhist narratives are understood. Moreover, I attempt to broaden the discussion of what comprises normative and special studies in Buddhology and Chinese History.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Womens studies, Ethnic studies, Gender studies, Buddhism, China, Cultural criticism, Feminism, Postcolonialism, Princess Miaoshan Legend, Women",57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
1845003445,"Hua, Kaiqi",The White Cloud Movement: Local Activism and Buddhist Printing in China under Mongol Rule (1276-1368 CE),Medieval,"The “White Cloud sect” was a name for a heterogeneous group of people doing diverse things under the sect’s name: devout laypeople and monks, extortionist elites, and profit-making Tangut monks. At different moments, it was a loose group of local lay practitioners, an official religious institution regulating Buddhist affairs, a business enterprise for networking with rich landowners and high-ranking officials, a social organization that obtained economic privileges for registered groups and individuals, a local entrepreneur that raised small-scale donations, a contractor for printing and selling Buddhist canons, and an advocate of religious syncretism. This dissertation studies the White Cloud movement in Song- and Yuan-era Jiangnan. Analysis of printing work and its relationships with the Mongol colonial regime, Chinese local lay activists, and Tangut diaspora monks reveals the dynamics of local religious activism and how the sect extracted social and financial benefits through religious activities, projects and events in the Hang-Jia-Hu subregion. The Song state banned the sect as a heretical group, but the White Cloud’s fortunes changed under the Mongol Yuan state, which recognized it as a new Buddhist school. The movement was mostly led by local laymen rather than monks. Its wealth and reputation peaked with the production of a Buddhist canon during the reign of Khubilai Khan (1276-1294), who provided direct patronage. I examine the Mongol government’s political and financial support for this unorthodox religious group - the institutionalization of religious communities (including establishing and abolishing a series of religious bureaus, appointing Tangut clergy officials)—and the response of local activists in turn. The White Cloud movement drew official supervision and attracted foreign monks while maintaining its mostly lay followers and non-doctrinal practice in rural areas. Newly emerging market towns in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou hinterland were the homes of most White Cloud sect devotees and their Buddhist canon’s local patrons. The region’s canal system fostered close networks for resource exchange. Local labor and material resources were used for the White Cloud sect’s Puning canon and the related Tangut script Hexi canon.

This dissertation examines the influence of Soviet advisers on the development of a Soviet-style higher education system in China. In particular, the dissertation focuses on Soviet adviser work in the tertiary schools of the Cantonese capital of Guangzhou in southeast China. Sovietization in Chinese higher education depended on the service of Soviet advisers. they were an essential component of the process and represented the human face of the Sino-Soviet relationship and of the Soviet Union. As “ambassadors” of Sino-Soviet solidarity and of the Soviet drive to create a “legible” cultural sphere across the globe, Soviet advisers were part of a transnational brotherhood of experts serving within the socialist camp. Based on archival, interview, press, and memoir sources from Asia, Europe, and the United States, the dissertation not only examines the work and legacy of Soviet advisers in Guangzhou, presenting a detailed picture of who these advisers were and what their lives were like in southeast China, but also demonstrates the transnational aspect of the Soviet adviser program through comparative reviews of Sovietization in East Central Europe and the service of other Soviet-bloc advisers (mostly East Germans) in Chinese higher education. The Chinese were never passive recipients of Sovietization, laboring to improve the management of the Soviet adviser program up through its surprising end in the summer of 1960. The legacy of Soviet adviser service in Guangzhou included ground-level cooperation between advisers and Chinese cadres that meant that any Sino-Soviet split on the ground came much later than at the level of high diplomacy and the elements of Sovietized higher education that lasted for decades. Relationships between Soviet advisers and their Chinese pupils transcended policies and bilateral tensions. The Soviet experience in Guangzhou also contributes to understanding the larger Soviet experiment and its expansion during the Cold War.

304414127,"Li, Rebecca Sai-Kuen",Alternative routes to revolution: An integrated model of societal disintegration in Qing China,Contemporary,"Processes of state breakdown described in the work of Goldstone (1991), Skocpol (1979) and Collins (1986 and 1990) are integrated to construct a macrostructural model of societal disintegration using the theorizing strategy introduced by Jonathan Turner (1995) in Macrodynamics. Structural processes in these models are conceptualized as instances of the more abstract macrodynamic forces. Ragin's (1987) idea of conjunctures of factors is used to group interacting factors together, and the conjunctures are seen as alternative routes to societal disintegration. The three alternative routes causing disintegration are the (1) Goldstone route involving population growth not accompanied by similar growth in production and concentrated power, (2) geopolitics route involving deteriorating geopolitical conditions and increasing external threat, and (3) distribution-power route involving rapidly growing distribution coupled with declining concentrated power. Principles from covariance structural modeling are used to create measurement models for each macrodynamic force, thus allowing for rigorous data collection and analyses. The Rebellion of the Three Feudatories (1674-1680), White Lotus Rebellion (1796-1805), Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864), and the 1911 Nationalist Revolution in Qing China are studied as cases that manifested varying degrees of societal disintegration. The goal is to explain different magnitudes of changes in societal disintegration from one case to the next, and examine why revolution did not occur in the mid-nineteenth century when conditions appeared conducive. The findings reveal no change in societal disintegration between the Three Feudatories and White Lotus rebellions, significant increase from the White Lotus Rebellion to the Taiping Rebellion, and even greater increase from the Taiping Rebellion to the 1911 Nationalist Revolution. Comparative analyses show that although population pressures had increased before the 1911 Nationalist Revolution, changes in the geopolitics and distribution-power routes caused the dramatic increase in societal disintegration from the period of the Taiping Rebellion to the 1911 Revolution.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Riverside,NA,NA,"Social research, Social structure, History, China, Qing, Revolution, Societal disintegration",2,Riverside,California,33.9381,-117.3949,United States
915054582,"Chang, Cheng David",To Return Home or “Return to Taiwan”: Conflicts and Survival in the “Voluntary Repatriation” of Chinese POWs in the Korean War,Contemporary,"At the end of the Korean War, only one third of the approximately 21,000 Chinese prisoners of war were repatriated to Communist China. the remaining two thirds, or more than 14,300 prisoners, went to Nationalist Taiwan in a propaganda coup. These Chinese POWs were at the center of contention in the second half of the war. Utilizing previously untapped archival sources and oral history interviews in China, Taiwan, and the U.S., this study examines how Chinese prisoners, individually and collectively, made divergent decisions in the process of voluntary repatriation. This research demonstrates that the Chinese prisoners' decisions and actions in UN prisons were directly related to their divergent pre-Korean War experiences in China under both the Nationalist and Communist regimes. The mini-civil war between the pro-Communist and pro-Nationalist prisoners revealed much of the suppressed social tension within China in 1949 and 1950, which exploded into life-and-death struggles in prison camps in Korea. Second, conflicting U.S. policies and the lack of a coherent and consistent policy on Chinese prisoners created much uncertainty and confusion among the prisoners. Out of fear and anxiety, both pro- and anti-Communist prisoners took increasingly aggressive and violent actions against their opponents, and against the prison authorities in the case of the pro-Communist prisoners. Third, while a small number of Nationalist interpreters and teachers hired by General MacArthur and his successors provided the vital communication channel between anti-Communist prisoners and Taipei, most fundamentally, the large number of prisoners controlled by a core of anti-Communist prisoners was a result of U.S. policy mistakes. By the time prisoner repatriation became an issue in armistice talks, the U.S. found itself riding a tiger that was impossible to dismount.

To do so it describes the political sources of the capital's establishment in 1928, the ideological discourse used to try to legitimize Nanjing as a new capital, the scientific methodology used to plan the city, the aesthetic experiments used to construct it, the reinvention of traditions used to make official spaces seem sacred, and the ways that people actually experienced life in the city. By looking at the various layers of meaning assigned to the city of Nanjing over these years, a better understanding of what it meant to be a modern Chinese capital emerges. In short, this dissertation is about the construction of the symbolic legitimacy of a capital city. It is the contention of this dissertation that “legitimacy” is the product of conflict, not unanimity. A symbol gains its power not from being free from conflict, but from convincing people that a higher truth exists above the fray. By the end of Nationalist era, Nanjing had become the legitimate capital of China, not because it had magically united the masses of China under the charisma of the late Sun Yatsen. Instead, the city only really became a symbol of Chinese unity because strife among those who cared for the values of Chinese nationalism that the capital represented remained constant throughout the “Nanjing Decade.” As long as people believed that it was important to struggle over the particular meanings and goals of nationhood in Nanjing, then the capital succeeded in embodying the imagined nation that transcended the struggles.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"History, Architecture, Capital, China, Nanjing, Nation, National symbols, Planning, Ritual, Urban planning",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States

Its focus is on the porcelain from the renowned porcelain city, Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province of southeast China. Jingdezhen has been the center of world porcelain production since the thirteenth century. Although Jingdezhen’s porcelain industries experienced tremendous changes and upheaval during the nineteenth century– including expanding overseas trade, decimation by the Taiping rebels in 1853, reinstatement of imperial patronage by the Qing Court during the Tongzhi Restoration – scholars of science, art, and Jingdezhen history alike rarely investigate this period. Contrary to scholarly consensus, the nineteenth century witnessed a surge in the production of texts and visual images detailing the aesthetics, technology, and manufacturing of Jingdezhen porcelain. This study focuses on the systemic production of knowledge about a material object - Jingdezhen chinaware - by tracing the global trajectories of key documents and visual images on porcelain that circulated within and across boundaries of such places as China, France, and Japan. I will highlight the circulation of such texts and visual images at crucial historical junctures of the nineteenth century, concentrating on periods of industrialization, inter-state conflict, and changing trade patterns. Thus this project will attempt to articulate the global and political processes that negotiate and re-position an object’s materiality—specifically the materiality of Jingdezhen porcelain—in relation to its visual and textual aspects.

This study argues that Shanghai abstract paintings were formulated in the unique historical and sociopolitical context of post-Mao Shanghai and, thus, have unique characteristics that do not always fit the conventional definition of abstract art. More specifically, it studies what kind of ideological meaning that abstract art held in the People's Republic of China (PRC), how the 1980s Chinese art circle defined abstract art, which cultural and historical background existed that allowed 1980s Shanghai abstract art to blossom, and how five select Shanghai artists, namely Li Shan (b. 1942), Zhang Jianjun (b. 1955), Qiu Deshu (b. 1948), Yu Youhan (b. 1943), and Ding Yi (b. 1962), each expressed their own understanding of abstract art through their paintings. Through this study, I ultimately aim to reveal that there are multiple versions of abstract art that are incongruent with its institutional description, thereby expanding our understanding of abstract art. This dissertation consists of five chapters. The first chapter, an introduction, establishes the problem with the canonization of the term, abstract art, and the single narrative of its history. provides a historical background of 1980s China. explains the modern art history of Shanghai. and locates this study in the broad range of scholarship. The four subsequent chapters focus on the ideological meaning of Chinese abstract art constructed by China's socialist identity. the discourses of abstract art in 1980s China. the unique cultural history of Shanghai. and the artworks of five representative Shanghai abstract artists. I conduct extensive visual analyses of abstract paintings and scrutinize historical, social, political, and cultural aspects of 1980s Shanghai. As the first English publication on 1980s abstract art in China, my dissertation sheds light on one of the most significant, yet often overlooked, if not neglected, concepts in not only the global history of abstract art but also the art of modern China.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,"Art History, Theory and Criticism",Art History,"History, Asian Studies, Art history, China, Chinese abstract art, Chinese modern art, Shanghai",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
1034338970,"Kinzley, Judd Creighton","Staking Claims to China's Borderland: Oil, Ores and State-building in Xinjiang Province, 1893-1964",Contemporary,"My dissertation focuses on the state campaigns to gain access to the mineral wealth of China's westernmost province of Xinjiang in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This approach helps reveal the important connections that exist between natural resources and the expansion of the state. The early twentieth century German economist Erich Zimmerman once argued that the earth's minerals only become resources through socio-political processes that pinpoint, extract and transport them, noting that natural resources are not, they become. In a similar way, frontiers too are in the process of becoming, and in the case of Xinjiang, the transformation of minerals into natural resources paralleled the transformation of this imperial frontier into a component part of the modern Chinese nation-state. My work finds that the campaigns to pinpoint, extract, and control the distribution of mineral wealth led to extensive mapping of the province, helped attract necessary capital for large-scale infrastructural projects, and served as a high wage incentive for destitute settlers from eastern and central China to migrate to this border region. Focusing on the links between state power and natural resource extraction in Xinjiang, my dissertation recasts the narrative of state building in China's west. The integration of Xinjiang into the Chinese nation-state was not simply the product of military conquest or Han Chinese ethno-cultural subjugation as many Western scholars have suggested, nor was it merely the outcome of a triumphal Chinese manifest destiny as asserted in the Chinese language scholarship. Instead, state building in this region long squeezed uncomfortably between China and Russia (later the Soviet Union) was a far more complex process, as various actors battled for control of Xinjiang's rich natural resources. Chinese leaders including Sun Yatsen, Chiang Kai-shek and later Mao Zedong all struggled to stake a claim to Xinjiang's mineral wealth in the face of competing claims from the Soviet Union and an assortment of provincial governors not particularly inclined to kowtow to Beijing, Nanjing or to Moscow.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, Natural Resource Management, Political science, Energy, China, Environment, Natural resources, Oil, Periphery, State building, Xinjiang",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
305346916,"Hess, Christian A.","From colonial jewel to socialist metropolis: Dalian, 1895–1955",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the transition of the port city of Dalian, a heavily industrialized seaport located at the tip of the Liaodong peninsula in China's Northeast region (Manchuria), as it shifted from a wartime hub of the Japanese empire to a socialist urban center heavily influenced by the Soviet Union. How did a long-term center of Japanese colonial modernity transition so seamlessly into socialist urban space? What elements of the Japanese project were fundamental parts of such a transformation, and how did the socialist regimes of the late 1940s and early 1950s deal with this? In answering these questions, my analysis delves deeply into the most controversial themes in modern Chinese history. I examine the legacies of Japanese colonial expansion and development on the modern Chinese nation-state, the social and cultural experiences of Japanese colonialism, the impact of Soviet occupation and local Sino-Soviet relations, and the nature of regime change, legitimization, and the reintegration of former colonial spaces into the Chinese state. I argue that warfare played a transformative role in the city's history. Placing this narrative at the center of my study, one can see commonalities in the Japanese, Soviet, and Chinese projects for governing Dalian, which involved mobilizing its people and resources for the successive campaigns war. Part of the project of establishing legitimacy here also involved how these various powers staked claims to the city. It is precisely because of its tenuous linkages to Japan, Russian, and China that one sees such a need for clarity. The Nationalist government staked a deep claim to Dalian, demanding its reintegration with China, while the PRC took a nebulous stance, choosing to downplay territorial claims by projecting an image of Dalian as part of the broader socialist world. What emerges is a very different picture of postwar nationalism in which the CCP was compelled to downplay the fact that a foreign nation was continuing to occupy Dalian. I argue that 1945 and 1949 may have been watersheds in Dalian's history, but they did not represent clean breaks from the past. Rather the city's socialist transformation was a continuation of many of the same social, political, and economic goals established under the colonial regime. The colonial legacy was, in fact, a key component of the socialist internationalist identity of Dalian in late 1940s, and influenced the rise of the patriotic nationalism characteristic of the 1950s. Similarly, the experience of the five-year Soviet military occupation of Dalian likewise played a part in the socialist definition of the city, and as Sino-Soviet relations rose and crumbled throughout the 1950s, the legacy of Soviet occupation would likewise inform the swift moves toward socialist development in the city.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"History, China, Colonial, Dalian, Metropolis, Socialist",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States

In May of 1950, seven months after the founding of the PRC, a military conquest brought Hainan under the control of the new regime. The campaign was successful as a result of coordination between mainland forces crossing the narrow strait in a flotilla of fishing boats, and a local Communist guerrilla force that had been fighting for over two decades to help bring about this victory.

304780312,"Fernsebner, Susan R.","Material modernities: China's participation in world's fairs and expositions, 1876–1955",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the ways in which a non-Western society has made use of material goods and traditions, both “Eastern” and “Western,” to invent and promote a unified national community. Its focus lies on China's participation in a series of world's fairs and expositions, national and international, from the last decades of Qing dynasty rule to the first decade of the socialist era. As an exploration of the ways in which the Chinese nation has been represented in the material spectacle of these fairs, particular attention is devoted to the ways in which objects themselves are assembled by a variety of actors to construct and advertise a national identity amidst a competing field of nations. This nation-on-display is seen as a creation of both domestic and international participants, including the diasporic community of “overseas Chinese,” and as a site for the integration of diverse constituencies including those of class, gender, and ethnicity. China's early participation in nineteenth century European and American world's fairs reflects a growing crisis of constitution for the Qing empire, a crisis of constitution that paralleled a similar crisis in material representation. Both the Qing state and a succession of later Chinese states would seek to reinvent the polity through a specific choreography of material objects and human subjects at these grand events. This study traces the efforts of state officials, nationalist elites and intellectuals to solve the dual crisis in socio-political constitution and material representation in a series of exposition events staged under the auspices of the Qing dynasty, the Chinese Republic(s) after 1911, and finally under the oversight of the Chinese Communist Party after 1949. Focusing on the convergence of new cultures of material display with an evolving nationalist pedagogy, this dissertation suggests that the material spectacle associated with the national campaigns of the revolutionary nineteen-fifties was not a new phenomenon but rather the product of an ongoing project undertaken in the last decades of the Qing dynasty—namely the transformation of an empire of Qing subjects into a nation of Chinese citizens ready to join the new regime of material production, and consumption, associated with the modern nation.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"History, China, Expositions, World's fairs",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States

With the recent advent of the PRC's northwestern development project, Qinghai and its neighbors now figure prominently in the Chinese media. Yet contemporary Qinghai rests on complex historical foundations rooted in the province's multi-ethnic population, frontier geography, decades of dominance by Sino-Muslim militarists, and the Republican governments' (1912-1949) border defense and development policies. This dissertation will evaluate the methods through which Qinghai's government sought to control and develop its pastoral peripheries, including military force, agricultural colonization, and the development of modern education systems. It draws comparisons between the Muslim, agricultural center around the provincial capital and the Tibetan and Mongolian nomadic regions.

304497994,"Broadwin, Julie Ann","Intertwining threads: Silkworm goddesses, sericulture workers and reformers in Jiangnan, 1880s-1930s",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the tensions between tradition and modernity in early 20th century China by comparing two intersecting groups of women in Jiangnan: silkworm raisers of the countryside and middle-class sericulture reformers from the cities. Sources consisted of local gazetteers, folklore collections, interviews, contemporary journals and newspapers. Home-based silkworm raising by women generated a sizeable share of peasant family income. In the early 20th century, with China's silk market in serious decline, women reformers attempted to improve silkworm raising by introducing scientific methods. Previous studies of the modernization of China's silk industry have focused on the economic issues involved. This study, however, takes a cultural perspective, and focuses instead on the relationship between gender, religious traditions and modernity in the modernization process. Both sets of women were able to move beyond the patriarchal constraints of their communities. Traditional silkworm raisers were valorized for their work, engaged in mixed-sex socializing and went on all-female pilgrimages. The reformers entered a professional world that included study abroad, publishing in scholarly journals, independent work, and the option not to marry. These findings force a reevaluation of assumptions regarding gender roles in China. This study highlights the cultural tensions that arose from the modernization process. Reformers saw the religion of silkworm raisers as obstacles. In the popular religious view, female bodies were uniquely qualified to raise silkworms due to their reproductive capabilities and spiritual connections with silkworms and the silkworm goddess. The reformers, operating under de-gendered scientific principles, sought to break this connection. Paradoxically, these opposing world-views were what underpinned the autonomy each group enjoyed. Popular religion supported the idea of female difference, which made room for women-centered activities. Modern scientific understandings emphasized the potential sameness between the sexes and therefore gave women access to a modern education and careers. The conflicts which arose between the silkworm raisers and reformers reflected these differing world-views.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"History, Cultural anthropology, Folklore, Womens studies, China, Jiangnan, Reformers, Sericulture workers, Silkworm goddesses",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
304666736,"Brown, Jeremy",Crossing the rural -urban divide in twentieth-century China,Contemporary,"This is a study of the historical process by which an individual's identity as a rural or urban person became one of the most important sites of social difference in twentieth-century China. I focus on interaction between city and countryside to understand how the gap between the two realms grew, especially during the first three decades of the People's Republic of China (1949-1979). Attempts to cross the rural-urban divide reified difference. During the Mao Zedong era, the more city people attacked the rural-urban gap, the more alienated China's cities and countryside became from one another, and the more rigid urban and rural identities became. I downgrade institutional explanations including the household registration ( hukou ) system in favor of social and cultural ones. In spite of restricted mobility, people continued to travel between city and countryside in massive numbers during the socialist period. Through rural-urban interaction, difference was negotiated on personal, familial, and professional levels. The hukou system was not a central factor in these moments of everyday contact. More important were language, appearance, labor, family, food, sex, and the historical legacies of the early twentieth century, when cities came to symbolize modernity and villages were equated with backwardness. Previously untapped archival sources and oral history interviews allow for fresh perspectives on the Communist takeover of cities in 1949, the First Five-Year Plan, the Great Leap famine, the Four Cleanups movement, the sent-down youth program, and the Cultural Revolution. The leap and its aftermath poisoned the relationship between city and countryside. The leap's legacy helps to explain the Four Cleanups and Cultural Revolution, which further alienated villages from cities. Overall, the conclusions of the dissertation fall in between and add complexity to earlier views of the People's Republic as either a model of pro-rural development or as a starkly divided land of apartheid and oppression. Stories of everyday interactions in villages and neighborhoods, combined with new knowledge of how local officials made decisions, show a society that was more diverse, complicated, and above all, more human than the simple institutional division into urban and rural spheres would suggest.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,History,History,"History, Geography, China, Cultural Revolution, Great Leap famine, Hukou, Mao era, Rural-urban divide, Tianjin",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States

The migratory experience of millions of Chinese has remained largely unexplored. This dissertation illuminates the history of the mass migration movement caused by the war. The work explores the roles of total war and nationalism in the transformation of Chinese modernity. For the Chinese state, the external invasion and the relative weakness of Chinese military power transformed the total war into a long-term and protracted campaign. The process of the wartime retreat to the interior allowed the Nationalist government to accomplish its agenda of centralization. The war greatly furthered the state's means of controlling industry, and increased control over the mobilization of the masses and of population movement. For the people, a consciousness of national belonging replaced regional identity in the course of the retreat. Moreover, the weakening of native-place associations as the foci of civil institutions contributed to a further dependency upon the state for the refugees' livelihood during and after the relocation. Although the great evacuation provided the government opportunities for legitimacy as the symbol of resistance and the extension of central authority, the increasing gap between mass demands for welfare and resource scarcity finally led to popular disillusion with the Nationalist government. In investigating wartime migration, my work seeks to revise the traditional periodization in the historiography of Republican China. Rather than viewing the war as an interim period for Republican China and as an impediment to the Nationalist schemes of modernization, my work examines total war as part and parcel of a continuum of nation-building efforts in modern China.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"History, History, China, Great Retreat, Nation-building, War of Resistance",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
305200143,"Songster, E. Elena",A natural place for nationalism: The Wanglang Nature Reserve and the emergence of the giant panda as a national icon,Contemporary,"In my dissertation I examine the economic and political correlations between the history of conservation in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the twentieth-century emergence of the giant panda as a national treasure. My research explores this relationship by means of a focused examination of the origins and impact of the creation of the first panda protection reserve, the Wanglang Nature Reserve in Pingwu County, Sichuan. The purpose of my study is three-fold. First, I examine the extent to which economic concerns and the political value of the giant panda were explicit factors in the creation and management of the reserve. second, I look at how the creation of Wanglang reflects broader nature protection agendas. finally, I explore how early efforts to protect the panda integrated the local area and its communities into the nation. As the giant panda continued to achieve positions of greater prominence as a national icon, issues surrounding its preservation had an increasingly direct impact on nature protection policy. With the use of government policy papers, scientific and popular journal articles, and interviews with participants in government, wildlife research, and members of the local communities, I trace the development of China's nature conservation policy at the national, provincial, and local level, and specifically in Pingwu County, Sichuan from the 1960s, when the reserve was founded, through 2002, when it was promoted to a national-level reserve. By that time conservation in China had become an object of international cooperation. Nature protection in the PRC began as a means of studying natural systems for development insights. It later employed the rhetoric of rational resource use, unexpectedly expressing striking similarities to capitalist conservation theories that were prevalent during the early twentieth century. After the Chinese government embraced the giant panda as a precious and rare species to be protected, it found itself caught between local communities and nature-protection advocates. one applying pressure for access and the other for restrictions. At each step, the panda served as a bridge between broader society, where it acted as a symbol, and its home rage, where it affected human interaction with the natural landscape.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"History, History, Science history, China, Conservation - China, Giant panda, History China 20th century, National icon, Nature protection - China, PRC history, Wanglang, Wanglang Nature Reserve",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
1437663934,"Baum, Emily Lauren","Spit, Chains, and Hospital Beds: A History of Madness in Republican Beijing, 1912–1938",Contemporary,"This study examines diverging ways in which insanity was understood and experienced across different segments of Beijing society during the early twentieth century. Approaching the history of mental illness from both institutional and phenomenological perspectives, the dissertation shows how entrenched views of madness continued to hold sway among the Beijing populace in spite of institutional change. The first part of the dissertation, which describes the evolution of Beijing's first municipal asylum from its establishment in 1912 to its later reorganization under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation, offers a colonial, Whiggish interpretation of institutional advancement in the wake of Western involvement. The second part of the dissertation then goes on to demonstrate how such narratives of medical and institutional progress were largely ineffective at influencing popular understandings of madness, which remained rooted in traditional cultural values and contemporary sociopolitical concerns. Due to the wide variety of economic, educational, and social factors shaping understandings of health and disease during the early Republican period, no singular understanding of insanity was able to fundamentally eclipse all others. This portrayal of discursive coexistence challenges previous depictions of mental illness in Republican China, which have tended to portray understandings of insanity as having been strictly influenced by top-down discourses of scientific rationality and biopolitical control. In contrast, this dissertation argues that there is no singular History of madness in China, and that institutionally based narratives of madness reveal only a partial—and frequently skewed—perspective of the larger picture. Instead, an analysis of everyday attitudes toward insanity reveals a plurality of dispersed and conflicting interpretations about the causes and cures for mad behaviors: interpretations that were influenced more by contemporary concerns than by officially sanctioned discourses.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,History,History,"History, Mental health, Science history, Asylum, Beijing, China, Madness, Psychiatry, Psychology",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
886771110,"Jacobs, Justin","Empire Besieged: The Preservation of Chinese Rule in Xinjiang, 1884–1971",Contemporary,"This is an ethnopolitical study of the majority non-Han, Muslim province of Xinjiang in China’s far northwest during the transition from empire to nationalizing state. After achieving provincial status in 1884, the final decades of Qing rule witnessed fatally weakened attempts by the central government to integrate Xinjiang into an emerging Han-dominated polity. Following the 1911 revolution, Xinjiang became a Han colony abandoned by the Chinese central government. Over the next four decades, the fate of this Han colony hinged upon the degree to which outside powers could exploit the Han crisis of colonial legitimacy, countered by the ability of the Han ruling class to neutralize, disguise, or otherwise suppress this challenge. This study is a detailed chronological narrative analyzing the nature of this threat as well as the evolving response of Han administrators. It is the first comprehensive study of this period to be conducted entirely from Chinese archival sources in the mainland and Taiwan, both published and unpublished. I find that the Han ruling class, despite numbering less than five percent of the total population and despite conditions of extreme financial hardship, proved adept at countering both internal and external threats to its position. This accomplishment ensured the preservation of Chinese sovereignty in a non-Han land until such time as a strong central government was able to reassert control along the frontier. As a result, the largely peaceful and seamless integration of Xinjiang back into the Chinese state after 1949 stands in stark contrast to the situation in Tibet and Outer Mongolia, the only other majority non-Han lands claimed by the Chinese central government.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,History,History,"History, Modern history, Borderlands, China, Colonialism, Empire, Frontier, Republican China, Xinjiang",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States

What I see in this movement is the invention of the new rhetoric and the new political repertoires (such as mass media, demonstrations, public meetings, speeches, and numerous revolutionary pamphlets) that emerged in China during the first decade of the twentieth century. The rhetoric centered on the issue of  quan,  which included both political rights and economic rights. The discourse of tax became linked to notions of mastership ( zhu ) of the polity. Drawing upon archival sources, diaries, memoirs, correspondence, transcripts of meetings, bank reports, account books, and propaganda pamphlets and newspapers, I argue that the Railway Protection Movement in Sichuan entailed unprecedented grassroots participation. The movement experience was filtered through the media to create a new political community, which transformed the ways in which politics were conducted in China. To be more specific, the old, bureaucratic imperial political culture was abandoned in favor of a popular republicanism in which elected assemblymen, students, intellectuals, and other local elites collaborated and competed in creating a new polity and a new understanding of the Chinese nation.

How did the attitudes of Chinese officials towards the West change, and how did they conceptualize and internalize what they saw there? To address these questions, this study looks at the meeting of cultures from the Chinese point of view and revises the defunct Western impact, Chinese response school of history by understanding the subaltern perspective. Diplomats were instructed to remit journals regularly to the court. Each chapter takes one diplomat's submissions as its subject. Chapter one focuses on Binchun's travels in 1866. He deployed a wide range of literary techniques to tame, feminize, and domesticate the West, treating it as an object of fantasy. Chapter two focuses on Zhigang's mission from 1868 to 1871. He concluded that the scientific and political achievements of the West were due to a superior application of Neo-Confucian principles. Chapter three focuses on Zhang Deyi's travels from 1866 to 1872. He was open to Western categories and ways of thinking, exhibiting a proto-nationalist consciousness. Chapter four focuses on Guo Songtao's mission from 1877 to 1879. He concluded that the West was in possession of the Mandate of Heaven. Chapter five focuses on Xue Fucheng's mission from 1890 to 1893 and the professionalization of Chinese diplomacy. This dissertation identifies three modes of narrative. Binchun and Zhang Deyi, in the 1860s, were enchanted and unsettled, and wrote to entertain. Zhigang and Guo Songtao, in the late 1860s and 1870s, explained the success of the West based on the moral and natural principles of Confucianism. Xue Fucheng, in the 1890s, employs a strategic and confrontational depiction of the West to win domestic support for modernization. The diplomats applied existing categories and ways of thinking to describe the West, creating versions of the West which were not in conflict with Chinese thought and practice.

My focus is on the connections between Chinese physical culture (in Chinese tiyu, or literally body-cultivation) and notions of the nation, modernity and a modern citizenry--namely, how the realm of tiyu served as a conduit for teaching Chinese citizens about modernity and the nation. The work is primarily based on Republican-era physical culture journals and bureaucratic reports, collected in libraries and archives in Hangzhou, Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai, and interviews with elderly ex-sports stars living in Taiwan and China. During the last decades of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), two forms of modern physical culture--the German-Swedish program of military calisthenics and gymnastics, and the Anglo-American sports of track and field and ball games--were imported into China. These basic forms, and the ideologies which shaped them, became the foundations for the development of a modern Chinese tiyu, or physical culture. Even China's indigenous martial arts, which represented to many the worst of China's feudal and backward traditions, came to be understood in terms of these new forms of rational competition, scientifically-approved modes of fitness, and the connections they posed between the individual body and national strength and worth. Physical culture in the Republic of China (1912-1949), whatever the form, always shared two tenets. First, the Chinese nation would be based in a modern and active citizenry who would learn the arts of self-discipline and attention to the larger consequences of all one's actions and movements. Secondly, these national duties could only be taught through educational, cultural, social and political programs that emphasized a physical education, a tiyu body-cultivation. This work aims to show how new ideas of physical fitness, physical education, physical exercise, and physical competition shaped the Chinese nation by influencing the ways in which Chinese understood and presented their bodies to fellow citizens and to the outside world.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"History, Physical education, Recreation, China, Exercise, Physical culture, Sports",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States

At the time this parasitic disease affected 10.6 million people with another 100 million at risk and occurred primarily in China's key rice growing regions. Based on reasons of military and economic security, the new Communist regime designated the campaign as a political, rather than a health campaign and promoted it as one of its earliest efforts at transformation of the rural environment. Although the campaign was hindered by lack of funding, material resources, technical and medical skills, and the recalcitrance of the putative participants – both villagers and local cadre. the Party was still able to use the campaign to realize beneficial goals and build positive connections at the bottom level. To understand the complex dynamics of resistance, assimilation, and attempts to assert authority played out against a background of impoverished resources and power struggles within the new regime, my project examines how the campaign unfolded in three case studies: a rural county in Jiangxi Province, a suburban county in Jiangsu Province, and in the urban environment of Shanghai.

305200797,"Schmalzer, Sigrid",The people's Peking man: Popular paleoanthropology in twentieth-century China,Contemporary,"This is a history of two faces of the “popular science” of paleoanthropology in twentieth-century China. The first, science dissemination, has entailed the spread of knowledge produced by scientific experts to the general population. The second, mass science, was a far more radical, bottom-up approach that in the Mao era sought to make science itself more “popular” through mass participation in scientific work. In examining the dissemination of knowledge about human evolution and popular participation in paleoanthropological research. I approach from a new angle many established themes of twentieth-century Chinese history for example, modernity, imperialism, nationalism, ethnic identity, class struggle, and authoritarianism. I also raise two issues that have been much less well explored: popular science and human identity. Through a detailed investigation of the production of knowledge about human origins, this dissertation sheds new light on the changing ways Chinese people in the twentieth century saw themselves as natural, social, local, national, and global beings. Without disregarding forms of identity that have defined some people in contrast with others, I encourage scholars not to overlook the potential for more inclusive kinds of human identities. And without denying the enormous implications of discourses that blur the boundary between humans and others, I insist on the need to take seriously the continuing, though changing, attempts to define what it means to be human. The dissertation further demonstrates that none of the questions that occupied scientists and science policy makers in socialist China—questions of class or social identity, religion, utility, and objectivity, to name a few—were simple. none were mere fictions of the state or party. and none are resolved in the West today. Most importantly, I propose that Mao was right to think the masses had something to offer science, but that his commitment to seeing them simultaneously as “superstitious” precluded their full and meaningful participation in the production of scientific knowledge about human origins. Nonetheless, paleoanthropology in China has never been estranged from popular culture, but rather has depended on it in myriad unacknowledged ways.

304660211,"He, Jiangsui","Identifying mistakes to discipline a new state: The rectification campaigns in China's land reform, 1946–1952",Contemporary,"Although the centralized bureaucracy characterized the imperial state of China, the imperial did not establish a thorough and direct control over the rural area. Chinese communists continued the efforts of various state-builders—the reformers of the Qing court, the Nationalists, and the Japanese—to build up a strong modern state. In 1946-1952, Chinese communists launched land reform over through China. They claimed to solve the land inequality in countryside through redistributing land. However, this land reform was neither merely for land nor simply about land. Chinese communists endeavored to build up a new state at the grassroots level through the redistribution of land. During this process, the identification and correction of mistakes was a constant agenda. This dissertation argues that the rectification campaigns played a vital role in the communists' efforts to build up a modern state. This dissertation examines the land reform processes of three villages—Xigou, Beiwan, and Nancun. These three villages were taken over by the communists one after another, and their land reform projects were under the guidance of different directives. Therefore, the examination on the land reform projects in these three villages could bring out an overall study on the 1946-1952 communist land reform, from the beginning to the conclusion. In all these three villages, the rectification campaigns were carried out to correct the mistakes of previous campaigns. This dissertation argues that through identifying and correcting mistakes in previous steps, the rectification campaigns provided chances for the communists to educate and train the villagers, local cadres, and policy-makers. These normalizing trainings in the 1946-1952 land reform functioned as a disciplinary revolution for the nascent state, which facilitated the communists to ground their power over local communities.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,Sociology,Sociology,"History, Social structure, China, Land reform, Rectification campaigns, State-building",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
1432190491,"Greene, Margaret C.","The Sound of Ghosts: Ghost Opera, Reformed Drama and the Staging of a New China, 1949–1979",Contemporary,"This dissertation is concerned with the reform and preservation of traditional drama, particularly those with supernatural subjects, in the People's Republic of China, largely as seen through intellectual debates of the 1950s and 1960s. I argue that between 1949 and 1963, the maintenance and reform of traditional opera was a key part of the Chinese Communist Party's policies toward cultural production. In contrast to narratives that characterize the socialist period primarily as one of cultural destruction, I assert that classical culture, as viewed through discussions on traditional opera, was treasured, promoted and protected by senior intellectuals. The first chapter follows the early efforts aimed at regulating traditional drama between 1949 and 1952. Specifically, it considers the decision of the Ministry of Culture to ban twenty-six plays and the impact the bans had on traditional repertoire and performances. Chapter two considers the fallout that stemmed from the early bans, as well as Ma Jianling's ghostless ghost play and the horrified reactions of intellectuals to his adaptation. The negative reaction of intellectuals forces us to reconsider preconceived notions of how Marxist intellectuals treated traditional culture. Chapter three places the production and reception of Meng Chao's Li Huiniang at its center. The play has generally been understood in the context of the Great Leap Forward. I argue we need to see it in the broader context of debates over ghost opera throughout the socialist period. Chapter four looks at the last open debate on ghost opera in 1963, the year that also saw ghosts banned from Chinese stages entirely. I argue that ghost opera is a barometer for the increasing radicalization of society, but that despite the leftward turn of politics, many people were not necessarily willing participants in the changes that were to sweep the country. Chapter five considers the role of ghost opera and traditional drama in the Cultural Revolution. I discuss two radical drama festivals and show that the cultural sphere was rather reticent to begin incorporating radical changes, until absolutely forced to in 1965. Finally, in the conclusion I briefly discuss the post-1976 story of Meng Chao and Li Huiniang and trace connections to cultural production as it exists today.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,History,History,"History, Theater History, China, Cultural history, Ghost opera, Intellectual history, Ma, Jianling, Meng, Chao, PRC, Reformed drama",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
304229257,"Dong, Yue","Memories of the present: The vicissitudes of transition in Republican Beijing, 1911-1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation analyzes the construction of Beijing's urban identity during the republican era. By focusing on the uses and transformations of urban spaces, it balances the abstract issues of how the city was perceived (by urban planners, the government, and sociologists) with the more concrete issues of how the city was lived and experienced by Beijing's citizens. In the Republic, the old hierarchies and walls of the imperial capital were steadily dismantled and new axioms of urban planning and social organization were in command. But often these new rules were more influential as form than as content, the government never having sufficient financial resources to realize a comprehensive city plan. The infrastructure construction projects, national products promotions, and development of public spaces to encourage activities of modern citizenship all had less effect than intended. Beijing's residents remained socially stratified and, in general, painfully poor. Moreover, many did not behave as model modern citizens. Even the sociologists, despite their more radical perspective on what constituted a moral community, could find few practical solutions to Beijing's social ills. What we find is that none of these projects designed from above were effective at mobilizing a popular concept of modern citizenship in Beijing. They were not what Beijing's residents regarded as aspects of the city's unique essence. For them the heart of Beijing lay, instead, in Tianqiao, and in the labor intensive activities we have brought together under the rubric of recycling. It is from the material practices of recycling and the sentiments it evoked that Beijing acquired a modern urban identity as a traditional city, permeated by an air of nostalgia.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"History, Urban planning, Area planning & development, Geography, Social structure, China, cities, urban identity",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
304328439,"Wang, Liping","Paradise for sale: Urban space and tourism in the social transformation of Hangzhou, 1589-1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation studies the emergence of Hangzhou as a modern tourist city through the reorganization of urban space and the manipulation of historical traditions of sightseeing. Although the focus is on the twentieth century, the dissertation extends back to the late imperial period to provide the historical context necessary to highlight the dramatic change of Hangzhou from a metropolis during the Ming-Qing period to a provincial culture garden in the Republican period. Hangzhou in the late imperial period was not only a nexus of commerce and administration, it was also a space in which elite and popular cultural activities flourished. This dissertation examines writings of literati sightseers on West Lake as part of a discourse on aesthetic taste and argues that they served as an important marker of status. Meanwhile, Hangzhou's unique position as the destination of annual pilgrimages and its heavy reliance on the market engendered by peasant travelers linked the city culturally and economically to its rural hinterland. In the modern era, Hangzhou was marginalized by the rise of Shanghai. The central theoretical concern of the dissertation is the modern response of Hangzhou's elite to the city's decline in status. This response is analyzed in terms of the invention of tradition and the commodification of culture. Since Hangzhou was bypassed by the mainstream of industrialization, it took advantage of its proximity to Shanghai and catered to the need for leisure time and activities expressed by the new middle class in that thriving metropolis. It did so by capitalizing on Hangzhou's reputation as a literati playground of the past. The emergence of modern tourism brought a drastic spatial transformation in Hangzhou, and the new tourist culture was created at the expense of old customs and popular religious activities. By the 1930s, the manipulation of Hangzhou's traditions became the subject of vigorous debate between New Culture intellectuals who condemned Hangzhou as effeminate and decadent and the Nationalist party luminaries who praised the city as an embodiment of China's national essence. In fact, both of these groups were appropriating the city's image in their efforts to forge a new national identity.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"History, Urban planning, Area planning & development, Social structure, Recreation, China",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
304418109,"Hsiau, A-chin",Crafting a nation: Contemporary Taiwanese cultural nationalism,Contemporary,"This dissertation is a study of Taiwanese cultural nationalism that has developed since the early 1980s. Drawing on the method of discourse analysis, the study examines how the concept of the Taiwanese nation has been crafted discursively by such pro-independence humanist intellectuals as writers, literary critics, Hoklo language revivalists, and amateur and professional historians. The focus of the analysis is on how these groups articulate the uniqueness of Taiwanese culture by reclaiming a distinctive literary heritage, linguistic tradition, and historical development in order to justify nationalism. The study departs from current research on Taiwanese nationalism, most of which concentrates on party politics, by shifting the focus to the activities of a nationalist cultural elite. The focus, then, is on how the ideology of cultural peculiarity has developed and the role it has played in political change. Before these recent phenomena are analyzed, the dissertation examines several earlier and related literary and linguistic issues. These include literary and linguistic reforms advocated by members of the Taiwanese cultural elite under the Japanese colonial government, literary discussions that went on between left-leaning Mainlander intellectuals and members of the native Taiwanese cultural elite during the 1947-49 period, and a debate on hsiang-t'u literature occurring from 1977 to 1978. Pro-independence humanist intellectuals' cultural works and activities are then analyzed, particularly those that construct concepts of Taiwanese national literature, national language, and national history. The dissertation argues that Taiwanese cultural nationalism emerged as political activists mobilized intellectuals following the Kaohsiung Incident. This sequence of events tells volumes about the nature of Taiwanese nationalism as an historical latecomer when viewed against the development of nationalism in the world at large. The dissertation also critiques two major views on the nature and development of Taiwanese cultural nationalism: (1) that this nationalism is a false identity and (2) that it is latent, a seed in the ground waiting to grow. This work argues that these two views are based on untenable essentialist assumptions regarding identity formation.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,NA,NA,"Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, History, Asian literature, China, identity",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
1892454250,"Kong, Lingqian",Between Love and Lust: Women and Literary Eroticism in Late Imperial China,Modern,"The Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911) were a time of changes. An urban culture that celebrated fictional texts emerged and commercial printing flourished. Various factors allowed mass production of erotic fiction. These stories articulate social anxieties about the unclear and unstable role of literati in society, the difficult positions that husbands and fathers found themselves in within the family structure, the newly-emerging celebration of private emotions and the hesitation towards it, and women’s struggles with prescribed morals. In erotic fiction, talented women became the preferred companions to distressed young scholars. The increasing amount of writing women in fiction corresponded with the social reality in late imperial China. The women writers of late imperial China were increasingly gaining authority through their literary activities. How were writing women portrayed in erotic fiction? Did women readers and writers consume such images? Were women integral parts of the ongoing discussion on eroticism? These are three of the major questions this dissertation attempts to answer. The project begins with analysis of images of talented women in fiction, both in works celebrated by their contemporaries and works that were published mainly for financial profit. Then it focuses on historic women’s reception of such images. Shifting from women’s readership to women’s authorship, the later chapters of the dissertation introduce a group of women’s own writings of eroticism that has not received much scholarly attention until now. Overall, this dissertation joins a vibrant conversation about the late imperial fiction as well as feminist discussions about women’s sexuality. The interdisciplinary nature of the project highlights the relationship between the literary production of late imperial China and women’s social history in China. Relying heavily on primary texts, this project shows how erotic text—authored by men and women—created a rich and valid site from which to explore the meaning of female sexuality, the role of writing women, and their ways of speaking about love and desire.",2017,2017,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Barbara,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Asian literature, Asian History, Womens studies, Chinese literature, Eroticism, Language, Late imperial china, Literature and linguistics, Poetry, Women",7,Santa Barbara,California,34.4285,-119.7202,United States
304587180,"Neo, Peng-fu",A study of the “Auxiliary Texts of the ‘Book of Changes’” [“Yiwei”],Ancient,"The Yiwei are component of the corpus of literature called chenwei , or weishu , which originated in Han Dynasty China (206 B.C.–220 A.D.) and have generally been referred to as the “Apocryphal” or “apocrypha and prognostication writings” in Western sinological works. This dissertation suggests that the chenwei be rendered as the “auxiliary texts of the Confucian classics.” The Yiwei therefore are the “Auxiliary Texts of the Book of Changes,” a set of writings meant to complement the Yijing . This dissertation accounts on the transmission of the Yiwei and outlines their major contents. Its focus of analysis, however, is on a particular concern of the writings: the attempt to correlate the Yijing with the calendar. The endeavor of establishing symbolic correlation between the Yijing and the calendar is mainly accomplished by the creation of certain models of correlative scheme that delineate the supposed correspondences between the components of the Yijing and the units of the calendar. Much of these correlative schemes embodied in the Yiwei have been recognized as closely related with the teachings of two prominent Yijing masters active during the mid-Former Han, Meng Xi and Jing Fang. Hence, it is generally believed that the Yiwei were mainly composed by the followers of the two masters and were sources exemplifying this particular school of Yijing learning. This study, however, attempts to identify within the passages of Yiwei certain ideas or concepts which possibly originated before the time of Meng Xi and Jing Fang. It argues that these ideas represented the thought of early Han Yijing scholars and were a reflection of their effort of responding to the major intellectual currents of their time. This dissertation, therefore, proposes that one should not be bounded by the tradition of seeing the Yiwei as primarily derived from the teachings of Meng Xi and Jing Fang, but should see it instead as a repository of the concepts or ideas evolved within Yijing studies through the span of time ranging from the post- Yizhuan (Appendices of the Book of Changes ) to the mid-Former Han.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Barbara,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, Apocryphal texts, Auxiliary Texts of the Book of Changes, Chenwei, China, Yijing, Yiwei",7,Santa Barbara,California,34.4285,-119.7202,United States
305196753,"Esselstrom, Erik W.","Gai Kei: The Japanese consular police in Northeast Asia, 1880–1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the role played by the Japanese consular police in the expansion of Japan's colonial empire in Northeast Asia. Beginning in the early 1880s, the Japanese Foreign Ministry initiated a policy of stationing police forces in its treaty port consulate offices across late Choso˘n dynasty Korea, later expanding the practice throughout China after the turn of the century. Charged with the duty to “protect and control” Japanese civilian communities on the Asian mainland, the consular police have the longest history of any Japanese colonial institution. Significantly, my research has revealed that the consular police were deeply involved in the surveillance and suppression of the Korean independence movement in exile throughout Chinese treaty ports and the Manchurian frontier during the 1920s. In fact, they evolved over the years from a relatively benign public security organization into a full-fledged political intelligence apparatus devoted to apprehending purveyors of “dangerous thought” throughout the empire. This aspect of Foreign Ministry activity on the northeast Asian mainland and its consequences dramatically challenge widely held notions about Japan's interwar diplomacy in East Asia. In broad historiographic terms, the story of the consular police compels historians of modern Japan to reconsider the hard boundaries often drawn between the spheres of “formal” and “informal” empire. In addition, by illuminating the fervor with which consular police forces pressed for unilateral solutions to Japan's continental security crises, my analysis challenges orthodox treatments of the relations between civil and military institutions in the imperial Japanese state. Beyond contributions to the historiography of modern Japan however, this work also adds to an emerging field of East Asian transnational history. Dealing with broader problems of prewar identity and nationalism, this project aims to approach Northeast Asia as a region of complex and dynamic social, economic, and political forces, thereby freeing us from the ahistorical trappings of postwar national history narratives in Japan, China, and Korea.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Barbara,NA,NA,"History, China, Consular police, Gai Kei, Japanese, Korea",7,Santa Barbara,California,34.4285,-119.7202,United States
275721275,"Shao, Dan","Ethnicity in empire and nation: Manchus, Manzhouguo, and Manchuria (1911–1952)",Contemporary,"This dissertation documents and analyzes the politicization of ethnicity for nation-building and nation-destroying of Manzhouguo (1932–1945) amid the Sino-Japanese confrontation, as well as its effects on the reconfigurations of ethnic and national identities of the Manchus in the postwar years. This cross-disciplinary study focuses on how ethno-nationalist discourse is used for nation-building during international confrontation over a multi-ethnic area, as well as how political and cultural integration of an ethnic group into a nation-state is reached while ethnic identity is reconfigured. As a product of nation-building competition between the Chinese government and Japanese colonial authority, Manzhouguo may serve as a historical reference for scholars concerned with current ethnic tensions and the rising voice of ethno-nationalist discourse in contested terrain similar to Manchuria in the 1930s. In the case of Manzhouguo, how did the Chinese and the Japanese sides politicize ethnicity and mobilize ethno-nationalist rhetoric in their nation-building projects for domestic and international audience? How did China and Manzhouguo try to include the Manchus into their rhetoric of nation-building? How did the Manchus view the nationhood of Manzhouguo? After Japan's defeat in 1945, what did Manchus remember about Manzhouguo? How is a collective memory of Manchus' roles in the Sino-Japanese war constructed, and how does it affect the reconfiguration of Manchus' national and ethnic identities in the post-war era? To answer the questions above, I examine how Manchu ethnicity was represented, by government, intellectuals, and the media, differently in Manzhouguo and in the Republic of China. By interviewing Manchu people, I also investigate the relations between political construction and the Manchus' memories of Manzhouguo. This research treats Manzhouguo not as a strain in either Japanese or Chinese linear history, but as a historical product of nation-building competition between different political regimes over a multi-ethnic and transnational area. This study will enrich current research on ethnicity and nation-building because, unlike successful examples such as Japan since the Meiji era or the People's Republic of China, Manzhouguo may tell us more about why not everyone may accept a given community, an ethnic group, or a nation.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Barbara,NA,NA,"History, China, Empire, Ethnicity, Japan, Manchuria, Manchus, Manzhouguo, Nation-building",7,Santa Barbara,California,34.4285,-119.7202,United States
896463599,"Hennessey, Anna Madelyn",Chinese Images of Body and Landscape: Visualization and Representation in the Religious Experience of Medieval China,Medieval,"In this dissertation, interdisciplinary research demonstrates how Chinese people affiliated with different religions and ideologies of the Song period (960-1279 CE) utilized artistic, literary and visual representations to merge the natural world with the human body. This fusion of natural and human worlds in representation appears in a variety of contexts, including paintings of famous Song landscape artists, writings of literati thinkers, architectural developments of Neo-Confucian scholars, body charts recorded in the Daoist Canon, and artwork connected to Chinese Buddhism. Traditionally, scholarship within the field of religious studies relies heavily upon textual sources, and material objects are often seen as accessory to the findings related to these sources. When found within the context of religion, art objects are in this same vein often described as representational as opposed to foundational of religious experience or its aspects. This thesis asserts that Song Chinese people used art and other material objects not only for the purpose of representing the world in which they lived, but also as a means of expressing, developing and empowering their religions and ideologies. So powerful were these material representations, in fact, that in certain cases they may have acted as a primary conduit through which the religion was experienced. As the dissertation will show, the interaction between the non-material activity of visualization, or how people create images in their minds, and representation, or how people create material objects to reify the images in their minds, is often pivotal, as opposed to accessory, to some of the later ideological developments of the Chinese people. This thesis also examines sacred space of the Song period, theorizing that an important spatial synergy took place between physical representations and the religions of medieval China: images had become intertwined with how different groups of people visualized their bodies, as well as how these groups represented a human relationship at work with the natural world. In essence, Song representations of mountains, landscape and other natural formations act as material records of how people visualized their own bodies in microcosmic and macrocosmic form.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Barbara,Religious Studies,Religious Studies,"Religious history, History, Asian Studies, Art history, Art, Buddhism, China, Chinese, Confucianism, Daoism, Religion, Visualization",7,Santa Barbara,California,34.4285,-119.7202,United States

In particular, my research addresses a body of literature on the “woman problem,” a topic of heated public debate centered on the status of women and their proper role in twentieth-century China. I ask the following question: what was the place of problem women—the unruly, the indigent, and the criminal—within the woman problem? Even though women criminals were among the most disenfranchised members of Chinese society, their lives touched on important issues of national debate about women’s purported inherent weakness and its relationship to national weakness.

1655594720,"Shuman, Amanda G.","The politics of socialist athletics in the People's Republic of China, 1949-1966",Contemporary,"This dissertation traces the political significance of sport to the Chinese socialist state between 1949 and 1966 by examining state-sponsored tiyu (loosely translated into English as sports and physical culture) and the connection between its two intertwined goals: tiyu for every citizen, and the development of elite sports programs. In these years Chinese leaders began to use international sport to carve out for China a different position in the world, while at the same time developing general tiyu and competitive training programs for ordinary citizens. China's athletic and political performance at international events was intended to showcase the emergence of a successful socialist state peopled by healthy, fit citizens and capable of international leadership. A diverse group of tiyu experts helped usher in a new organizational and institutional structure for tiyu in the early 1950s. Inspired by the Soviet model, this included introducing the Soviet Ready for Labor and Defense system in China (known in Chinese as the laoweizhi ) as the centerpiece of the government's efforts to use mass tiyu in order to cultivate the ideal socialist citizen. Chinese leaders also signaled their deference to Soviet leadership in the international socialist movement by participating in socialist bloc delegation visits. By the late 1950s, work unit sports associations, spare-time sports schools, and the laoweizhi effectively blurred the lines of mass and elite sport because they included ordinary citizens while also providing ways to identify those with more athletic potential. As the Sino-Soviet relationship deteriorated in the latter half of the 1950s, Chinese officials turned away from relying on Soviet models, but continued to promote basic socialist ideals, such as collectivism, serving the motherland, and internationalism, as part of larger domestic efforts to build a superior Chinese brand of socialism. This included a massive increase in competitive sports programs during the Great Leap Forward and the mainstream emergence of socialist tiyu popular culture, which included sports films and reached an apex with the First National Games. Beginning in 1961, however, recovery from the post-Great Leap Forward economic disaster required tightening the belt in tiyu . Mass tiyu and elite sport became separate, increasingly distinct entities, and most state funding went to the latter. By the mid-1960s, mass tiyu consisted primarily of paramilitary activities, workplace calisthenics, and inexpensive sports like ping-pong, basketball, and swimming. Elite sport meanwhile prospered and nearly all state-level funding went to training an elite cadre of internationally competitive athletes. In the years between the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, elite sport helped open up new transnational networks and establish foreign relations that reconfigured China's place in the world following the Sino-Soviet split. Sport served as a way to showcase and promote Chinese socialism and China as the exemplary socialist model for others to follow, particularly those in recently decolonized Third World nations. The height of these efforts came with the first Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO), a sports mega-event that took place in Jakarta in 1963, which China and Indonesia promoted as an alternative to the Olympics. The turn in high politics during the early Cultural Revolution isolated China in most of its foreign relationships, and subsequently, put a temporary halt to all sport.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Cruz,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, China, Communism, International events, Socialism, Sports and physical culture",11,Santa Cruz,California,36.9789,-122.0346,United States
1701284710,"Tai, Jeremy",Opening up the northwest: Reimagining Xi'an and the modern Chinese frontier,Contemporary,"This study examines how different ideological regimes in modern China have all responded to crises, whether economic, territorial, or spiritual, by extending state power and accumulation strategies into the northwestern corner of the country. Histories of modern China have typically turned to eastern centers of state and colonial power, especially Beijing and Shanghai, for an index of economic development and modernity. I show how Northwest China, a seemingly remote backwater, has figured prominently in political economy over the long twentieth century. The dissertation demonstrates how economic planning in China was born not in the People’s Republic, but during the Great Depression when the Northwest became the first of a series of focal regions created to transfer capital and population from the coast. “Opening Up the Northwest” was followed by three campaigns launched in the name of correcting regional inequality in the People’s Republic of China: the First Five Year Plan (1953-1957), the Third Front (1964-1980), and, most recently, “Open Up the West” (2000-present). My dissertation contributes a cultural and historical perspective to conversations among geographers and political scientists about the growing importance of regional economies as subnational scales of territorial organization. Through a panorama of state campaigns in the Northwest representing fascist, communist, and neoliberal ideologies, my project shows how Chinese leaders have garnered national support by constructing fantasies that speak to the cultural and environmental particularities of the region. State-builders have often inspired a nation to head to the Northwest by likening this region to “virgin land” in the American West or reminding their audiences of past glory along the ancient Silk Road. Beyond the gaze of state authorities, my work delves into complex experiences inflected by gender, class, and ethnicity in the regional center of Xi’an. A closer look at these historical moments reveals the realities of underdevelopment, the dispossession of ethnic minorities and agricultural communities, orphans forcibly recruited for settler colonialism, traditional virtues imposed on “Modern Girls,” the criminalization of refugees and migrants, and accelerated environmental degradation. My work contributes to the growing literature on everyday life in China, using the local histories of Xi’an and its environs to show how the material instantiations of modernity always fall short of the desires they engender no matter where they take place.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Cruz,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, Geography, Urban planning, China, Modern chinese frontier, Northwest china, Xi'an",11,Santa Cruz,California,36.9789,-122.0346,United States
304887349,"Day, Alexander F.","Return of the peasant: History, politics, and the peasantry in postsocialist China",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines contemporary debates on China's emerging rural crisis and its relationship to intellectual politics in the reform era (1979 to the present), putting these debates into historical perspective. The post-Mao reforms in China, which began in the countryside, helped lay the foundations for the much-touted Chinese economic take-off, and by the mid-1980s were largely seen as a major success. Twenty years later, however, rural China and the peasant are often discussed in public and intellectual discourse as the greatest predicaments facing the continuation of reforms and the economic growth. How did the figure of the peasant, so central to our understanding of Chinese history, shift from a figure of success to one of crisis? We cannot make sense of this shift simply by paying attention to the economics of rural development or the internal politics of the Chinese Communist Party, but need to investigate the vicissitudes of reform-era intellectual politics and contemporary reflections on recent Chinese history. This dissertation is an intellectual history of the present, tracing contemporary debates on rural China and modernity and their historical resonances, debates that have had an important effect on state policy. The work of Cao Jinqing, Gan Yang, He Huili, He Xuefeng, Lin Yifu, Lü Xinyu, Lu Xueyi, Qin Hui, Wang Hui, Wen Tiejun, and others is discussed. It also investigates current rural activism, especially the new rural reconstruction movement, which attempts to strengthen rural society by rebuilding cooperative relations. The dissertation pays particular attention to the relationship between historical understanding and politics as a key site of contention. It argues that an investigation of how people narrate recent Chinese history is a key to understanding the emergence of the peasant as a figure of crisis. The peasant is the site of the return of politics because of the material difficulty of integrating the peasant and agriculture into a society increasingly dominated by the market logic of global capitalism.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Cruz,NA,NA,"History, Capitalism, China, Peasantry, Politics, Postsocialist",11,Santa Cruz,California,36.9789,-122.0346,United States

It adopts a queer approach to the historical study of China, in that it resists the naturalized understanding of heterosexual relations as the only way of human. It closely examines gendered and sexual significations of the language, pointing out the processes by which heterosexual norms was produced and searching for historical moments when a queer utopia was imagined to challenge the conventional gender and sexual order. The dissertation asks the following questions: what kinds of thinking about male same-Sex relations were circulating in twentieth-century China? What was the long-term historical trajectory of this thinking, how did it interact with Western sexological knowledge, how did it condition the dissemination and acceptance of Western concepts of homosexuality? How were these ideas both Chinese and Western, transformed in the process of their interaction? How did the social and political context in which the process occurred determine the meaning of male same-sex relations, and in turn, what can those meaning tell us about nationalism, modernity, and semi-colonialism in twentieth-century China? The dissertation argues that male same-sex relations figured in many different ways across genres, and multiple conversations went on at the same time in China during the first half of the twentieth century. From the early 1920s to the early 1930s, while translators of Western sexology were divided between those who pathologized homosexuals for social immorality and those who praised same-sex love as the foundation for a human utopia, a group of iconoclastic literary writers followed the mode of Western decadent writings, presenting a beautiful image of intimacy between male friends and posing male same-sex love as a protest against conventional social and sexual norms. Meanwhile, cultural conservatives used tabloid newspapers as their forum, casting sex between men as a sign of the weakness of the nation. As the Japanese invasion deepened the national crisis from the late 1930s, while these conservative writers continued to blame men who had sex with other men for the misfortunes of the nation, progressive literary writers also made an effort to erase the history of male same-sex relations in the Peking opera field.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Cruz,NA,NA,"History, Cultural anthropology, China, Men, Queer, Same-sex relations",11,Santa Cruz,California,36.9789,-122.0346,United States
304859848,"Chan, Shelly","The overseas Chinese project: Nation, culture, and race in modern China, 1890–1966",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the history of the making of the overseas Chinese ( huaqiao ) in China from 1890 to 1966. Emerged only in the 1890s, the term huaqiao referred broadly to Chinese sojourning from China during the course of an expansive project to incorporate Chinese abroad into the Chinese nation. The project was spearheaded in the late nineteenth century by diplomats, reformers, and revolutionaries, all of whom operated overseas and came to view huaqiao as a vital resource. This transnational vision of the nation remained central to Republican and Communist governance until the 1960s. But the huaqiao project itself was marked by constant change and vast heterogeneity, producing friction in many instances that upset the imagined union of China and Chinese abroad. As it turned out, huaqiao were not simply Chinese who lived elsewhere waiting to be awakened and led by the homeland. Rather, they emerged as a congeries of unruly elements encompassing intellectuals who brought conflicting ideas about nation and culture based on colonial experiences abroad in the 1920s and 1930s, transnational communities that posed a seeming threat to domestic political order in the 1950s, and returnees who came to Chinese shores from all backgrounds and were highly critical of government policies in the 1950s and 1960s. Troubled, declared obsolete in state discourses both in China and beyond during the 1960s, the huaqiao project is nonetheless unfinished. Revived and active is the notion that China is the cultural and ethnic homeland of Chinese globally, as expressed in the new terms, huaren (persons of Chinese culture) and huayi (persons of Chinese descent). The huaqiao project suggests that the making of an overseas Chinese identity always intersected with dilemmas of opportunity and belonging facing communities and nations in a globalizing world. The huaqiao project is unfinished because these dilemmas were not, and are unlikely to be, easily resolved.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Cruz,NA,NA,"History, Modern history, Social structure, China, Huaqiao, Migration, Modern China, Nation, National identity, Overseas Chinese, Transnational communities",11,Santa Cruz,California,36.9789,-122.0346,United States
887100965,"Mo, Yajun","Itineraries for a republic: Tourism and travel culture in modern China, 1866–1954",Contemporary,"This dissertation is a study of the development of modern Chinese tourism and diverse experiences of travel ( lüxing ) in China from the last years of the Qing dynasty to the early years of the People's Republic. By looking at Chinese travelers' journeys to the West, Japan, eastern coastal China, and China's western frontiers, this study explores how travel and travel writing were not only intertwined with different nation-building projects, but also formed new ways of worlding China at different historical moments. More broadly, by juxtaposing varied Chinese travel experiences with Japanese exploration of China in the early twentieth century, this dissertation also examines the processes of region-making and nation-state building, processes that both reinforced and undermined each other. After the First Opium War, Chinese elites began to look anew at China's position in the world. Beginning in the 1860s, Qing officials involved in the management of foreign affairs began to travel abroad on diplomatic missions. Their travel writing provided new vocabulary and geopolitical discourses, stimulating the discussion of reform inside and outside the Qing court. At the turn of the twentieth century, travel accounts penned by exiled reformers continued to transform Chinese travel writing from a literary form to a polemical genre. Paying attention to both the imperialist powers and the colonized spaces, they also began to envision a Chinese nation in their travel writings. During the Republican era (1912–1949), the development of the China Travel Service, the first and largest travel agency owned and run by Chinese, was closely tied to nation-building projects and region-making processes. Commercial travel writings also occupied an important place in the collective imagination of a Chinese nation-state. This imagination was undergirded by a variety of travel writings that circulated in the Chinese popular press, ranging from reports on scientific expeditions to commercial writings on leisure travels. Simultaneously, a growing number of Japanese travelers began to journey to China for leisure and professional purposes, engendering a transnational regional imagination. Examining travel and travel writing in late Qing and Republican China, this dissertation illuminates the workings of nationalism and coloniality in East Asia.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Cruz,NA,NA,"History, Recreation, China, Colonialism, Nationalism, Tourism, Travel culture",11,Santa Cruz,California,36.9789,-122.0346,United States
305351486,"Chin, Angelina Yanyan",Bound to emancipate: Management of lower -class women in 1920s and 1930s urban South China,Contemporary,"My study analyzes state regulation and public debates of lower-class women service laborers who were commonly identified as prostitutes, teahouse waitresses, singers and household laborers, but who also moved between industries and across the borders between rural and urban Guangzhou and Hong Kong in the 1920s and 1930s. The stigmatizing and sexualizing of lower-class women laborers were central to the ways that Hong Kong and Guangzhou city residents crafted their exclusivist notions of urban citizenship. Women's emancipation ( jiefang ), much emphasized in May Fourth rhetoric, was interpreted differently in the two cities. In Hong Kong, emancipation meant freedom from Chinese influence as well as colonial control. in Guangzhou, it was part of the process of modernizing the city, but also symbolized the political tactic of the Communist Party, which privileged class over gender in its movement against social inequalities. The metaphor of freeing an enslaved/bound woman's body often appeared in local discussions and social campaigns in both cities as a way to mobilize the population to empower women to become agents and citizens. Nevertheless, as these emancipated women started to appear more casually in public venues in the late 1920s and early 1930s, morality became a concern for local authorities. Through looking at various social campaigns, I explicate how emancipation and the right of citizenship for lower class women were restricted by their gender and sexual behaviors. My study also challenges the nation-based framework of history which continues to influence our historiography of Hong Kong and China by arguing that the categories of city and region were more pertinent than nation to the lower class migrants who were willing to work in any urban setting, disregarding distances and national boundaries. It contributes to the existing scholarship of modern urban Chinese history by reorienting our focus from popular cities such as Shanghai to a scarcely explored region of South China, and its concentration on two cities separated by political rule reveals the complexity and contradictions underlying the discourses of emancipation, which were both distinctive and representative in early 20 th century China.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Cruz,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, China, Emancipation, Lower-class, Nineteen 20s, Nineteen 30s, Urban communities, Women workers",11,Santa Cruz,California,36.9789,-122.0346,United States

I look at simultaneously existing paradigms of authority surrounding doctors of Western medicine, scientific medical knowledge, and Chinese herbal medicine in the print media of 1920s Shanghai. The historical confluence of challenges to Chinese medicine and the rise of Western medicine are the backdrop of this story. The fall of the last dynasty in 1911 prompted Chinese reformers to question their guiding paradigms in all areas of life, including language and politics, science and medicine. Intellectuals like Liang Qichao condemned traditional Chinese culture, which was seen as weakening China in the face of foreign imperialism. Chinese medicine however, was not completely repudiated. For all the harsh criticism of Chinese theories of knowing the body based on concepts like yin yang, and methods of diagnosis such as pulse reading, in areas of treatment, herbal and mineral especially, doctors and patients still viewed their native medicine as retaining some value. For prior to the rise of medical schools in the mid-19th century and lab-based biomedicine in the mid-20th century, doctors of Western medicine – often portrayed as charlatans hawking unproven nostrums – struggled to respond effectively to diseases. I ask how Chinese doctors of Western medicine in Shanghai made a case for themselves as figures of authority at a time when Western medicine was ascendant yet could not offer reliable cures for many of the major diseases of the time. Drawing on professional medical journals, popular newspapers, and legal regulations, I show how physicians presented themselves as ethical professionals; how medical journals turned subjective experience into objective scientific knowledge; and the ways professional, popular, and state reporting transformed authoritative herbs into efficacious drugs. The forms of institutional organization and knowledge production that created this medical authority simultaneously produced a whole host of tensions: between professional ethics and medical entrepreneurship; scientific knowledge that was locally contingent but sought to be globally coherent; and between authentic and commodified indigenous medicine. I argue that a particular formation of Sino-Western medicine, knowledge production, and the market in Republican Shanghai resulted in print media restructuring hierarchies of knowledge production to hinge less on asserting the inherent qualities of medical experts, knowledge, or drugs, and more on articulating the institutional processes that validated claims as an expert physician, producer of medical knowledge, and purveyor of effective medical treatments.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,History,History,"China, Doctors, Drugs, Herbal medicine, Print culture, Medical authority, Western medicine,",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States

My research demonstrates that certain death ritual practices prevailed among Tang elites of various regions and social strata and remained stable throughout the entire Tang dynasty, suggesting the existence of a standardized way of commemorating death in medieval China. Furthermore, my research reveals significant regional variations and temporal changes, which I use to examine the mechanisms behind uniformity and variety. This dissertation also makes an original contribution to the understanding of actual mortuary practices among Tang elites of various strata and regional backgrounds. My core research material, the many thousands of Tang-era epitaphs, allows me to get closer to the actual practices of “ordinary” elites rather than rely on descriptions of rites by the ritual specialists in charge of compiling prescriptive ritual manuals. Moreover, as each tomb epitaph text usually provides a glimpse of a person’s life, tomb epitaphs are often the most direct and personal accounts of individuals, and they offer a perspective on a greater range of elite society than do either dynastic-history biographies or the eulogies preserved in the literary collections of famous writers.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,History,History,"Cultural standardization, Death ritual, Digital humanities, Divination, Tang dynasty, Tomb epitaphs,",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
2600000003,"Watson, Jesse David",Paperwork Before Paper: Law and Materiality in China's Early Empires (221 BCE-220 CE),Ancient,"This dissertation examines the role of law in the formation of China’s earliest empires (221 BCE-220 CE). Using thousands of manuscripts written on bamboo and wood which have been excavated in China in the several decades, I argue that legal practice was central to the formation of imperial identity. Building on theoretical insights from the anthropology of paperwork, as well as from recent studies of manuscript culture, I argue that legal manuscripts can be read not only as representations or records of social conditions, but as material objects whose production and circulation itself constituted new forms of sociality. Eschewing a conventional law and society approach, my dissertation follows a diverse array of actors —women, servants, magistrates, foreigners and family members— as they use practices of writing and law to lodge claims of status, identity, kinship, and property. In linking newly excavated manuscripts with discussions of law and materiality, this dissertation aims to challenge multiple orthodoxies derived from notions of European legal and bureaucratic modernity. Accounts of early law have long cited certain types of legal text, such as penal statutes, as evidence for the idea that early law was informed by the rationality of state and directed at social control. By locating legal practice not in state sanction but in the circulation of legal manuscripts, I am able to reframe this persistent debate to take account both of newly discovered manuscripts and also to interpret receive sources in new ways. My dissertation thus complements and provides crucial context for revisionist trends in the historiography of imperial China that query the central presumption of despotism and legal orientalism. By linking law to material practices, I am further able to sidestep teleological narratives of rationalization and state control, and to provide a plausible explanation of why imperial legal culture could persist both beyond the geographic reach of the imperial court and long after its collapse.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Berkeley,History,History,"Law, Materiality, China, Early Empires,",44,Berkeley,California,37.8722,-122.276,United States
2638040795,"Jenne, Jeremiah Greenleaf","Bleeding Hearts: Religion, Violence, and the Tianjin Riots of 1870",Contemporary,"On June 21, 1870, rioters in the city of Tianjin killed 20 foreigners and a Chinese Catholic priest attached to the Lazarist mission in North China. The “Tianjin Massacre,” as it became known in the West, was the deadliest incident of anti-foreign violence in China until the Boxer Crisis of 1899–1901. Among the dead were the French consul and ten nuns who administered an orphanage in Tianjin as part of the Paris-based Holy Childhood Association. Word of the riots swiftly spread to other cities in China and then, via telegraph lines, around the world. In China, the news stoked fears in the international community that the riots in Tianjin might be the start of a coordinated campaign of violence targeting foreigners. The representatives of the foreign powers expressed outrage and demanded the Chinese government take steps to protect foreign nationals and foreign interests in China. As most of the casualties had been French citizens, Count Julien de Rochechouart, representing France, demanded reparations and the heads of the officials in Tianjin. Rochechouart threatened military reprisals if the government did not give in to his demands. For several weeks it looked like a war between France and China was inevitable, at least until events in Europe intervened. The first two chapters examine the situation for Christianity in China through 1860 and the signing of the Beijing Convention. Chapter one also looks at Tianjin society and introduces several social groups which took part in the riots, including the hunhunr, flamboyant but violent gangs who engaged in low-level criminal activity and were an important source of muscle for the city’s fire brigade and militia. The third and fourth chapters describe the Lazarist mission in China in the 1860s and the establishment of the Catholic orphanage in Tianjin. Dispensing medicine was a part of the nuns’ mission, but what the nuns saw as the advantages of modern medicines and the healing power of the Christian Faith could, to others, appear like magic, even sorcery. The Holy Childhood Association baptized young children at the point of death, which raised suspicions among residents. Rumors and salacious stories, some spread by printed anti-Christian polemics, only added to the fear and loathing many Chinese felt toward the missionaries. French authorities in China expended a great deal of energy and defending missionaries when their activities led to conflict. Chapter six looks at how Count Julien Rochechouart (1831–1879) and his predecessors managed these cases and argue that their defense of missionary privileges worsened tensions leading to a cycle of reprisals and more conflict between Christians and non-Christians. Chapters seven and eight describe the events leading up to the riots and use official reports, eyewitness statements, and other contemporary materials to reconstruct the events of June 21. The final chapters examine the aftermath of the riots, the official investigation carried out by the eminent statesman Zeng Guofan and the tense diplomatic standoff between France and China over the Chinese government’s handling of the case.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Davis,History,History,NA,10,Davis,California,38.5553,-121.737,United States

2587842328,"Lo, Yi Ci","Measuring Up to Modernity: Metrological Reform in China, 1870s–1940s",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the early history of the meter, the liter, and the kilogram in modern China. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, foreign and Chinese elites began to condemn the profusion of different metrological practices and systems across China as chaotic and backward. The growing consensus that China needed to have one measure produced different proposals for standardizing weights and measures in late Qing (1644–1911) and Republican China (1911–49). In the Nanjing decade (1927–37), the Guomindang (GMD) government ratified one of these possibilities, setting out a two-track plan for China to embrace the metric system within a few years. This study analyzes records produced by the different groups which lobbied for, led, conducted, and responded to the Nanjing government’s metrological reform to specify the objectives, priorities and values which animated it. Officials from the National Bureau of Weights and Measures insisted that they were enforcing an orderly, scientific system of measurement which would inculcate modern habits of mind and practice in Chinese society; facilitate economic planning and China’s industrialization; and, the development of science in China. In practice, the comprehensive, exacting regulatory regime they established to keep every instrument and act of measurement in line worked to assert the Nanjing government’s absolute and ultimate authority over all metrological matters in China. In the 1930s, the state-building project to ensure compliance with the legal system of measurement produced mixed results among diverse metrological communities which found that they had to contend with an intrusive, demanding state in addition to choosing metrological practices which served their own needs for order, convenience, and legibility. Metrological reformers had to respond to merchants who refused to give up their old tape measures and steelyards, and scientists who asserted their right to design China’s system of measurement. When they did so, they clarified that metrological reform sought, above all, to centralize metrological authority in the Nanjing government, and consolidated the considerable progress towards national metrological standardization achieved by a national network of inspectors of weights and measures.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Irvine,History - Ph.D.,History,NA,57,Irvine,California,33.6772,-117.7738,United States
2310000028,"Yan, Dong","Sinews of Paper: Public Debt and Chinese Political Economy, 1850 – 1914",Contemporary,"This dissertation offers a new narrative on the history of public debt in late Qing and Republican-era China (1850 – 1914), highlighting its links with late Qing and Republican political economy. A history of economic ideas and institutions, the dissertation draws from official and diplomatic communications, contemporary newspapers and journals, academic studies and private letters to explore the process of its embedment into Chinese fiscal system and its evolution in China as a set of discourses and practice, including its reception by officials, merchants and general public, and its adjustment to established discourses of political economy in late Qing and Republican China. Adopting an expansive conception of public debt to include related public credit mechanisms and discourses, the dissertation traces the impact of pre-1850 official debates on late 19th Century Chinese officials’ ambivalence towards modern public debt. It argues that a domestic intellectual and policy reorientation in favour of growth was needed and mostly achieved before Qing’s military defeat in 1895, paving the way for large-scale borrowing that in turn reconfigured state-society relations in late Qing. The dissertation also investigates how mid-Victorian liberal discourses on public debt were co-opted by Chinese reformists, which in their modified form of political and fiscal accountability, proved to be effective in dominating late Qing and Republican discourses on public debt. This dissertation is one of the first English-language studies discussing the evolution of economic ideas surrounding Chinese public debt.

2050000007,"Wen, Chenghao",Bronze Age Economic and Social Practices in the Central Eurasian Borderlands of China (3000-1500 BC): An Archaeological Investigation,Ancient,"It is a widely accepted fact that the cultural interaction between Northwest China and its westerly Eurasian counterparts about 2000 BC generated far-reaching impacts on both sides. Through the study of material culture in its archaeological contexts it is often possible to identify what goods were exchanged by way of which routes. However, less attention has been paid to exploring the cultural mechanisms that explain the nature, extent and specific cultural processes behind these cultural interactions. Taking Northwest China as its point of departure, this dissertation attempts to understand long term developments in Bronze Age Central Eurasia from a multi-scalar spatial perspective by focusing on the socio-economic dynamics among the region’s various cultural communities. Based on analysis of currently available mortuary data, I reconstruct the middle-range oasis societies along the Hexi corridor, characterized by a low degree of social differentiation and an agnate-centered or patrilineal organization. Meanwhile, the comparative analysis on contemporaneous cemeteries also reveals the underlying heterogeneity of these middle-range oasis communities, which gave rise to social tensions and was enmeshed with mobility and interaction on a regional scale. In addition, a dynamic social life is reflected by the social practice of communal activities and gatherings at both intra- and inter-community scales; this can also be observed archaeologically through the lens of a study of drinking vessels. Seeking to understand material-culture distribution patterns in Northwest China with a focus on the Qijia culture and its neighbors from a bottom-up perspective and with an emphasis on human agency, I interpret their interactions by means of a trade-diaspora model. Moreover, I revist the longstanding controversy over the Seima-Turbino technological phenomenon and reveal the underlying socio-economic processes in the transmission of metallurgy across Eurasia through an investigation of the development of metallurgy in the Eurasian Metallurgical Province. Comparative study of the Andronovo cultural-historical community in present-day Siberia and Kazakhstan and analogous remains in Northwest China suggests the formation of interregional economic complexity under the stimulus of metallurgy under the Andronovo horizon. By scrutinizing this interconnected economic network, this dissertation provides an alternative perspective for understanding the macro-cultural processes that developed throughout the first half of the second millennium BC, both in Northwest China, (which is culturally a part of Central Eurasia), and in the East Asian heartland.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Los Angeles,Archaeology 0082,Archaeology,"Social sciences, Bronze age, Central Eurasia, China, Economic practice, Social practice,",2,Los Angeles,California,34.1141,-118.4068,United States
2480000035,"Shih, Jamin Duane",Ku-Mo: Popular Culture and the Impossible Sovereignty of Taiwan,Contemporary,"This project examines the ways Taiwan’s contested sovereignty pokes holes in dominant understandings of what it means to be a sovereign nation based on the discourses of Taiwan that appear in transnational popular culture and media. As a result of Taiwan’s role as a global economic center, the traces Taiwan leaves behind in transnational media, and the scandals they garner, reflect the larger dynamic of Taiwan as a constant problem and yet a valuable commodity for powerful nation-states. Taiwan is simultaneously a site of transnational profit for states like China, as well as a rhetorical threat to a One China Policy. This liminality represents a kind of impossible sovereignty—one that is politically illegible, but functional nonetheless. This form of sovereign absurdity for Taiwan is perhaps best encapsulated by the Hokkien term ku-mo. Ku-mo is a transliteration of a 台語 colloquialism 龜毛, which describes someone who is slow or high maintenance to the point of inconveniencing others. There is a second definition to龜毛, one grounded in a Buddhist idiom that represents an absurdity—something that does not and ought not to exist. I argue that Taiwan’s impossible sovereignty can be described as ku-mo in the sense that it is conceptualized both as an impossibility and an inconvenience that disrupts otherwise uniform and smooth processes of international trade and media production. Taiwan’s contemporary liminal sovereignty presents a profound problem for the very nation-states that attempt to erase it, and as a result of Taiwan’s role as a center of transnational capital, the debate over Taiwanese sovereignty is contested and mediated transnationally through culture and the culture industry of multiple nation-states. The relevant question of Taiwan’s sovereignty for us is not, “Is Taiwan sovereign?” but rather “What does the discourse surrounding the question of Taiwanese sovereignty accomplish and how does it function?” Examining sovereignty as a discourse and a practice allows us to explore the ways conceptions of sovereignty are defined by documentation, institutions, and bureaucracy that are perpetually attempting to contain that which cannot be contained.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Merced,Interdisciplinary Humanities,Interdisciplinary Humanities,"Ku-Mo, Media, Popular culture, Sovereignty, Taiwan, Transnationalism,",2,Merced,California,37.3057,-120.4779,United States

State-building constructed institutional infrastructure to bind and govern, and nation-building institutionalized cultural history to formulate the imagined community. Both state- and nation-building were institution-building. Gradually, the managerial leadership of Republican China became a meta-institution that further institutionalized other institutions into a system. This system assumed intellectual leadership, defined and evaluated art, distinguished art from non-art, and presented art to the artworld public. Through collective art activities and shared art conventions, the individual art institution and network of art institutions functioned as socializing structures that reproduced cultural powers reversely enhancing the socio-political institutions. Inspired by Cai Yuanpei’s slogan “aesthetic education as a substitute for religion,” the four-chapter dissertation goes from the iconoclasm of the heavenly mandate, to the voice for one’s own art history, then to the mass art that coalesced professional education and economic activities, and finally to the political officialization of national arts – a new form of enchantment in a modern nation-state. The first chapter digs into the rapidly changing social and institutional properties of the in situ Institute for Displaying Antiquities (1914-1948). The public accessibility to the Forbidden City and emptied throne desacralized the cosmic and political symbols. The second chapter looks at the two state-subsidized art activities overseas. The two exhibitions spoke for the concept and history of Chinese art in Europe from the Chinese perspectives. The third chapter explores the interdependence between production, commerce, art, national salvation, nationalism and urban modernity. The chapter investigates the national products and the consumer identity, and examines how a spectator-market could redefine the masses’ spatiotemporal understanding of the nation and the presence. Last but not least, the fourth chapter on the Second National Arts Exhibition (1937) discusses how the eclectic assembly of arts and crafts presenting the past, the present, the future, the indigenous, and the foreign could together construct the presence of the imagined community in the geopolitical boundary.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,Visual Arts,Arts,"Alternative modernity, Art institution, Republic of China 1912-1937, Art education, Displaying antiquities,",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States

This study examines the role of huidaomen, especially self-defense associations and redemptive societies, in the cultural nexus of power in rural China. By analyzing their participation and intervention in local elections, lineage conflicts, defense against banditry, and merchant networks, I argue that the Nationalist Government’s state penetration in rural China was a bureaucratic failure due to its poor management of informal power structure in local communities. It also explores how the Communist Revolution abruptly ended such existing informal power channels during the regime-change period. The anarchic rural political environment was finally destroyed by the Communists’ three waves of Anti-Huidaomen Campaigns from 1950 to 1961. My study makes two contributions to the field of modern Chinese history. First, my dissertation introduces a critical but overlooked subject in local societies across China. With official statistics showing more than thirteen million lay members in the huidaomen nationwide in 1949, huidaomen were the largest non-state participants in local governance. Despite some scholarly research on their role in peasant rebellions based on Qing Dynasty legal cases, scholars know almost nothing about the presence of these societies in the twentieth century. My study focuses on the huidaomen without the presence of large-scale rebellions, which illustrates their role in an everyday setting and avoids the danger of labeling them indiscriminately as rebels. Second, my project pioneers the promise and challenges of using new and rare forms of internal public security files such as interrogations, confessions, and verdicts in the PRC. Relying on over a hundred complete criminal cases from the CCP’s Public Security Bureau in the 1950s that deal with legal cases of both the Republican era and the early PRC, my dissertation is an unprecedented experiment in using systematic internal public security documents produced by the CCP as historical sources.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,History,History,"Chinese martial arts, Chinese popular religion, Chinese redemptive societies, Huidaomen, Modern Chinese history, Rural governance of China,",29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
2620087376,"Lin, Chihho",Illustrating a New Nation: Shanghai Lianhuanhua in the Early Maoist Period,Contemporary,"This dissertation centers on the formation of socialist lianhuanhua in China in the 1950s and 1960s. Lianhuanhua is a special genre of comics that was widely welcomed by urban readers in China from the early twentieth century to the mid-1980s. Aiming to reform readers into socialist subjects, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) instrumentalized lianhuanhua for didacticism and propaganda. Following the Stalinist dictum of “socialist realism”, which mandated proletariat art to be “national in form and socialist in content”, lianhuanhua artists selected pictorial elements from European academic painting, folk art, and Chinese classical painting from different regions and periods in history to create an effective visual language that answered both the Party-State’s demand and urban readers’ taste. The dissertation first illustrates the CCP’s tactics for reforming the lianhuanhua industry in Shanghai in terms of production, circulation, and censorship. In the subsequent chapters, I examine three iconic lianhuanhua published by Shanghai People’s Art Press, including Zhao Hongben and Qian Xiaodai’s Sun Wukong Thrice Beats the White-Bone Demon, He Youzhi’s Great Changes in a Mountain Village, and Ding Binzeng and Han Heping’s Railroad Guerrillas, to inquire into the following questions: What innovations and conventions were adopted by artists in the making of lianhuanhua? How have lianhuanhua artists recycled, reinterpreted, and redeployed cultures through time? How do these various reuses reflect their particular political, social, and cultural contexts? By dissecting the visual components in the lianhuanhua, I explore how socialist realism, as an aesthetico-political project, evolved and adjusted to fit the conditions in China after its introduction from the Soviet Union. The research adds to recent studies of Chinese socialist culture that question the common perception of socialist realism as a method imposed by the state and therefore is rigid, monolithic, and monotonous. In this research, I demonstrate lianhuanhua making as a complex process that involves negotiations between high politics, cultural policies, the target readers’ preferences, and artists’ understanding of their task of creating new works for a new nation.",2021,2021,Ph.D.,United States,University of California San Diego,Visual Arts,Arts,NA,29,San Diego,California,32.8313,-117.1222,United States
2190000000,"He, Fang","""""Golden Lilies"""" Across the Pacific: Bodies and Paradoxes of U.S. Inclusion in Enforcing the Chinese Exclusion Laws",Contemporary,"""""Golden lilies"""" is a euphonious English term widely used to refer to bound feet or bound-foot Chinese women. The female foot, although is usually seen as a personal and trivial matter today, was seriously implicated not only in Chinese nationalism and modernization, but also in U.S. enforcement of Chines exclusion laws, as well as in the construction of U.S. superiority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911), footbinding had become a widespread practice among all social classes in China. In the face of national crisis resulted from Western encroachment and Japanese aggression, Chinese elites and nationalists launched nation-wide anti-footbinding campaigns to revitalize the nation in the late nineteenth century. In the United States, the Otherness of China appeared most vividly in the custom of footbinding. Paradoxically, however, U.S. immigration officials perceived bound feet as a sign of better morals and higher class. Bound feet thus became a means to obtain an exemption from U.S. laws against Chinese immigration. Therefore, this dissertation started with a simple question: What made possible the admission of the Other? Footbinding has been commonly considered as a topic of Chinese history and as a subject of feminist critique of the """"male gaze."""" This study instead, investigates it as a visual, discursive and bureaucratic vehicle in U.S. enforcement of Chinese exclusion laws across the Pacific in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It shifts from prominent themes of U.S. immigration historiography–restriction and exclusion–to who was admitted by examining the bodily proof of exemption, knowledge production in the immigration administration, and the larger social milieu which granted validity to those rationales and logic. Using Chinese- and English-language sources, this dissertation not only challenges U.S. construction of the Other by exposing fissures and instabilities of U.S. orientalist representations of footbinding, but also provides a critique of Chinese participation in orientalism. An exploration of immigration case files reveals that racialized, gendered and classist perceptions of Chinese bodies were utilized to crack the gates of the United States, which in turn, reinforced footbinding as a timeless oriental practice, visualizing the backwardness, cruelty and racial inferiority of China. An examination of historical newspapers, magazines, and periodicals indicates that there was no monolithic condemnation towards footbinding in U.S. discourses and that the Chinese internalized orientalism in their reaction towards the U.S. discourses and displays of """"golden lilies."""" Drawing information from extensive missionary publications intended for different audiences in both countries, I challenge the often-exaggerated missionary success in banning this practice by showing how missionary accounts rendered invisible the Chinese-led anti-footbinding movements. In addition, this study analyzes immigration archives as a contested site of knowledge production to reveal the technologies utilized by law enforcers to marginalize Chinese voices and place the Other in a different time. Tracing how white female bodies were discussed and measured across the Atlantic and in untold stories of Chicago Cinderella foot contests, this dissertation explicates striking similarities between U.S./Western foot fever and Chinese footbinding. Through a comparative and trans-Pacific lens, I demonstrate the power of the visual and the body in shoring up multiple forms of U.S. orientalism in a trans-Pacific public sphere and in making possible the paradoxical codification of the Chinese Otherness in U.S. inclusion. This approach allows us to juxtapose the changing reality of China with timeless, static U.S. representations. It shows the paradoxes of U.S. inclusion undergirded by its operations of differences, which often denied coevalness with the Other. This study offers insights into the historical forces that have contributed to fortifying racial, social, cultural, religious and institutional borders with the Other. It reveals how this past as a collective memory and legal legacy continues to shape contemporary assumptions about inclusion and exclusion, tradition and modernity, and globalization and nationalism.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Barbara,History,History,"Social sciences, Chinese exclusion laws, Footbinding, Orientalism, The body, U.s. immigration,",7,Santa Barbara,California,34.4285,-119.7202,United States
2705426466,"Lu, Yun-chen",A Left-Turn to Artistic Eccentricity: Gao Fenghan (1683–1749) and Disability Art in Eighteenth-Century Yangzhou,Modern,"This dissertation investigates Gao Fenghan (1683–1749) and the development of his disability art and aesthetics in early modern China. Scholars have categorized Gao Fenghan (1683–1749) as one of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, a group of artists who were active in southern China during the early Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) and gained renown for rejecting the Beijing court’s orthodox painting style in favor of their own aesthetic choices. Among these artists, Gao earned fame because of his left-handed style, which he developed after the paralysis of his right hand. I argue that this disability enabled him to move beyond his early practice in the dominant literati style and generate his own artistic idiosyncrasy, which was popular in the Yangzhou art market that favored nontraditional art. Among Gao’s art, I particularly focus on his calligraphy because it especially reveals the development of how he made use of his disability in his art. I argue that his left-handed calligraphy adopted characteristics of archaic writing from ancient inscriptions on Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) steles from his native Shandong in northern China, which created the “raw, obstinate, rough, and awkward” aesthetic that he valued after his paralysis. Shandong, with its abundance of ancient steles, was a major source for epigraphic study that reached its maturity in northern China in the mid-eighteenth century. Previous scholarship on epigraphic study has focused on its role in the north but neglected its influence in the south, where eccentric artists like Gao drew upon Chinese cultural heritage while introducing stylistic innovations. Through examining Gao’s art and writings, this project demonstrates that he intended to create artworks that challenged traditional aesthetics, social values, and political structures. My project offers a new understanding of disability aesthetics rooted in Chinese culture, beyond the Eurocentrism of prior disability theory in art history. Through studying the development of Gao’s artistic style across media, geography, and abilities, I argue that Gao charted a path whereby artists with disabilities could express themselves and gain favor from arts patrons who increasingly appreciated artistic eccentricity.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Barbara,History of Art and Architecture,Art and Architecture,NA,7,Santa Barbara,California,34.4285,-119.7202,United States

This project draws on archival and published documents, mostly from the cities of Shanghai and Tianjin, to demonstrate that, despite numerous and overlapping political campaigns, unstable foreign relations, and rapid policy changes during the decades following the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, one area in which the state had a remarkably consistent policy was its efforts to foster a specific kind of socialist childhood. Although the officials of the Maoist state believed children should be reared by their families, their goal of producing cooperative, revolutionary citizens required efforts to constrain non-state “bad influences.” State officials’ wariness about the values imparted by family and community members was compounded by the mobilization of women for production, which took many adult women out of the home and had the potential to leave children unsupervised for long periods. The desire to supplement or supplant inadequate supervision of children caused the state to intrude in family structure and child-rearing in new and important ways. “Inventing the Socialist Child” helps scholars understand how the shift to socialism brought major changes to every area of life, including gender roles, family life and child rearing, and the everyday experience of childhood during a time of revolutionary change. “Inventing the Socialist Child” enters broader conversations about childrearing and family-state relations in the postwar era around the world, and demonstrates that China used children in a tool of its postwar stabilization and nation-building efforts, deploying images of children in domestic and international propaganda, as well as actual children as agents of state-directed change—both ideological and practical—within families and society.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,University of California Santa Cruz,History,History,"Social sciences, Childhood, China, Chinese history, PRC, Socialism, Youth,",11,Santa Cruz,California,36.9789,-122.0346,United States

""""Maritime Manchuria"""" refers to the Bohai/Yellow Sea Rim, the area that runs along Manchuria, tracing the edge of east and north China and the Korean Peninsula, and extending into the corner of the Pacific. It is composed of port cities, less urbanized coastal villages, and the sea. The rim is not just a physical space, but also a space defined by social and economic relations. Questions animating this dissertation concern the kinds of human activities required to bring this rim into existence, the types of people who lived along the rim, and how they contributed to the development of the region. The dissertation has two major goals: to highlight the transnational networks of commercial, cultural, and knowledge exchanges in the region, and to take full account of the everyday lives of local laborers, including male dock workers, women who grew seaweed and collected shellfish on shore, fishermen, students who were sent down to the coastal rural villages, and entrepreneurs. Its underlying argument is that region-making, nation-building, and environmental transformations require attention to those who made their living along the Manchurian coast.

It is conventional wisdom that the Maoist state neglected environmental protection in favor of a drive to harness the environment for socialist construction. Only after Mao’s death, scholars assert, were laws promulgated to protect the environment, and it was not until the 1980s that China began to concern itself with environmental consciousness. My dissertation contests the prevalent idea that China in the 1950s and the 1960s was environmentally unfriendly and ignorant by showing that the discussion of environmental protection in could be dated back to the 1950s and the 1960s. It places an exceptional emphasis on the role of scientists, who actively participated in national and international discussions on environmental science, in the process of conservation policy-making. Moreover, my dissertation suggests that diverse and complicated factors such as bureaucratic compromises, the local economy, and the government’s relationship to indigenous Northeast peoples were behind the environmental degradation of the People’s Republic. Local struggles over the implementation of the state’s environmental policy in Northeast China suggest that current issues of Chinese state-initiated conservation have long historical roots dating back to Maoist China.

Educated in the United States, (Ph.D. University of Michigan at Ann Arbor 1936), Chen embraced social responsibility in democratic movements. Civil war and Japanese invasion weighed heavily on the minds of all Chinese including Chen Renbing, who opposed the pre-1949 Nationalist government and belonged to the China Democratic League, the “communist's little brother.” After 1949, Chen was called upon to act as judge against counter-revolutionaries and assumed that his opinions on matters of public policy were welcome, valued, and well-known. However, Mao's government did not favor what was perceived as Chen's mixture of theater, acting and politics that clearly favored western style democracy, a logical alternative for Chen who was weaned on Dr. Sun Zhongshan's Three Principals of the People and grew up in a foreign mission enclave. Politics ruined his marriage even before Chen's comments placed him in the select category of “Big Rightist” during the 1957 Anti-Rightist Campaign. Thousands of intellectuals were targeted by Mao Zedong as “stinking weeds” because the fragile communist party underestimated their control over intellectuals, particularly in light of how intellectuals adapted to school reorganization in 1952. This study suggests that had Mao Zedong not subjugated intellectuals in the post-1949 era of the Cultural Revolution, Chinese could have avoided the tragedy suffered by patriotic returned students during mass mobilization movements.

The Nationalist government (NG) was no exception. The NG resumed China's national pride during the Second World War, but in Taiwan, the United States maintained the NG's international status, so the NG was forced to hide its Chinese nationalism in front of Americans. In the presence of less-developed allies, however, the NG was able to provide aid and assistance to these countries on its own terms. By showing Taiwan's economic, military, cultural, and technical supremacy to less-developed countries, the NG was able to regain the feeling of being a rich and powerful China. Among the regions receiving Taiwan's foreign assistance, Africa probably best embodies the essence of what the NG was trying to accomplish. Helping a continent that the Chinese perceived to have made less progress than themselves allowed the NG to hold itself out to the world as the legitimate and powerful China.

1426178543,"Schwartz, Adam Craig",Huayuanzhuang East I: A study and annotated translation of the oracle bone inscriptions,Ancient,"This dissertation takes as its central focus the newest discovery of writing from the commencement of China's historical period. The Huayuanzhuang East oracle bone inscriptions, discovered in 1991 and published in six folio volumes in 2003, are a synchronically compact and unified corpus of 2452 individual divination accounts inscribed on 529 (345 completely intact) turtle shells and bovine scapulae that were produced during the late Shang period (ca. 1250-1045) under the patronage of a prince of the royal family. The records stand as one of the most important epigraphic finds in the history of Chinese archaeology. Due to the limited corpus of non-royal oracle bones dating to the earliest phase of the Chinese written language, our understanding of Shang civilization remains partial and incomplete. What the field of Shang studies has needed for quite some time is more discoveries of complete oracle bone inscriptions that reveal information about a broader dimension of Shang civilization. Chapter 1 presents the core information of the discovery: the pit and its contents, codicology, the nature and importance of the inscriptions, working with synchronies, and periodization. I conclude with a review of the major studies and summarize objectives of the dissertation. Chapter 2 introduces and discusses the people. I make two critical determinations. The first is that the protagonist, a person who as a rule was referred to by his diviners and scribes only as our lord was the son of the king, Wu Ding, and one of his main consorts, Lady Hao. I identify him with a person seen in concurrent royal inscriptions called Rong. The second is a new explanation that the name Ding, the most powerful figure in the inscriptions and the prince's father, is a non-royal appellation for the living king and means our Highness. I conclude with an overview of the rest of the prince's family and key members of his entourage. Chapter 3 argues in favor of seeing oracle scribes as China's first collective group of writers. I dispel the notion that they are mere copyists or simple engravers by illustrating their creative application of graphic design layouts. I construct a tiered methodology to extract identity by focusing on the features of the script, orientation, and other scribal habits. Appendix 1 is a complete, annotated translation of the inscriptions. Each divination account is presented in an easy-to-read three line format: the first line is in oracle bone font transcription, the second line is in modern Chinese transcription, and the third line is the English translation.

304643927,"Peng, Ke",Coinage and commercial development in Eastern Zhou China,Ancient,"The objective of this dissertation is to study the economic history of Eastern Zhou China. It is based principally upon a large number of bronze coins excavated archaeologically, and uses analytical methods of—and has implications for—such diverse fields as archaeology, paleography, history, historical geography and economic history. In Chapter One, the history of numismatics in China is reviewed. Chapters Two and Three deal with the reading of coin inscriptions and the dating of coins. In the final two chapters, the social and economic significance of Eastern Zhou coinage are explored. Besides a reconstruction of the relation between coins and people, issues such as coin production, usage, debasement, buying power and circulation are discussed in detail. Moreover, modern economic theories and comparisons with the history of Western coinage are applied to the study. The dissertation demonstrates a core-periphery Eastern Zhou commodity economy. Patterns of coin circulation and monetary systems varied in different states. Currencies of the Han, Zhao and Wei states were used also outside of their state of production, while those of the Qin, Chu, Qi and Yan states were used only locally. Han, Zhao and Wei had an open monetary system, while Qin, Chu and Qi had a closed one. These differences indicate the core and periphery of the Eastern Zhou commodity economy and reflect the relative economic power of the different states. In order to understand the causes of these differences, economic resources such as land, labor, and capital in different states are analyzed.

305062226,"Lin, Hu",Urban landscape and politics: The making of Liao cities in Southeast Inner Mongolia,Pre-modern,"Throughout much of the 20 th century, archaeological investigations of urbanism were dominated by various versions of social evolutionism, situating the city either in a regular system of historical transformations or in subsistence demands that tied it to local ecological conditions. Nevertheless, in recent decades scholars increasingly recognize that ancient cities must be understood as invented political instruments to legitimate and enact power. Following this insight, this dissertation highlights the importance of political practice to a theoretical understanding of urbanism through a study of the Liao cities on the Xilamulun pastureland in Southeast Inner Mongolia, China. The Liao empire was established by nomadic pastoralist Khitans in AD 916. The Imperial heartland was the Xilamulun river valley, their pastureland. Beginning at the end of the ninth century, Khitans intentionally transplanted numerous groups of settlers from conquered lands to the Xilamulun pastureland to reside in a number of newly built walled cities and villages. Although the pastureland was extensively urbanized, the Khitan emperors and the majority of central bureaucrats maintained their nomadic lives and traveled constantly. Adopting Adam Smith's (2003) political landscape approach, my research examines three dimensions of landscape of Liao pastureland cities, i.e. imagination, perception, and experience, to understand the articulation of politics with urban landscape. Using data from historical documents, my archaeological surface survey of Bitubei (a Liao city in the Xilamulun river valley), a detailed analysis of ceramic assemblage collected of Bitubei, and an instrumental neutron activation analysis of 89 samples of Bitubei ceramic sherds, I argue that, in seeming defiance of local ecological conditions, Liao pastureland cities were produced by Khitan emperors to legitimate, consolidate, and increase their power. These settlements did not emerge simply as byproducts of the social transformation from nomadic Khitan tribes to the Liao empire, but rather were brought forth as one of the political instruments deployed by rulers who pursued their own strategic interests.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Political science, Social structure, China, Cities, City, Inner Mongolia, Khitan, Landscape, Liao empire, Pasture, Politics",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304954350,"Kyan, Winston",The body and the family: Filial piety and Buddhist art in late medieval China,Medieval,"This dissertation addresses the problem of cultural translation by investigating the coexistence of filial piety and Buddhist art in representations of the Sutra on Repaying Kindness at Dunhuang. These include the problems of translating religious images from their textual sources, foreign Buddhist images into native Chinese idioms and complex artistic changes into neat academic arguments. Accordingly, Chapter One rethinks the opposition of filial piety and Buddhism in both historical and modern sources through a critique of sinicization as an interpretive model. By demonstrating that filial piety is neither unique to China nor opposed to Buddhism, I reframe the question of how to interpret cultural interaction with the fundamental question of why use cultural interaction at all to interpretat artistic change. Chapter Two charts the development of Sujati narratives as an important component of Sutra on Repaying Kindness paintings at Dunhuang. Depicting a young prince offering his flesh to his starving parents, this image integrates Confucian and Buddhist attitudes toward the body thought to be contradictory, a discrepancy that I explain through the contemporary practice of cutting the thigh. Chapter Three investigates the early history of cutting the thigh, a filial practice in which children offer their flesh to ailing parents. By examining Buddhist scriptures, Confucian histories, rhetorical essays and archeological evidence, I show that the medieval Chinese discourse on cutting the thigh complicates conventional understandings of filial piety and bodily values even within monolithic categories such as Confucian and Buddhist. Chapter Four analyzes the four other narratives in Sutra on Repaying Kindness paintings. By arguing that the notion of repaying kindness emphasizes the mother and the moral authority of the child, I question standard assumptions of Chinese filial piety as centered on the father and parental prerogatives. Chapter Five situates Sutra on Repaying Kindness paintings into the Dunhuang family caves that contain them. By examining decorative, figural and epigraphic references to the family in these caves, I argue for the construction of a distinctive family space that idealizes private life, ancestral history and contemporary viewing practices.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Art history, History, Religious history, Art, Buddhist, China, Filial piety, Medieval",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

They are ambitious in scale and design, and in the variety and quality of the stone carvings. The sculptural, inscriptive, and architectural material are of great artistic and historical value and exhibit the innovative character of Northern Qi art. The modes of representation of the human figure apparent in the Northern Qi period are markedly different from those of the early part of the sixth century under the Northern Wei. The engraving of Buddhist sutras in stone, which becomes widespread in the Northern Qi period, is previously unknown. The stupa with dome roof, rarely seen in the metropolitan area of China before the Northern Qi, becomes the prevalent type. This study examines these three separate aspects of the art of Xiangtangshan--the sculpted images, the engraved Buddhist scriptures, and the architectural form of the stupa--in a variety of contexts. Important elements of Buddhist observance and practice can be seen to correspond to these separate artistic forms. Considered as a whole, they bring together a number of interesting concepts and issues. Among these are Northern Qi art and ethnicity, relationships between texts and images, and the multiple meanings of visual signs. The three principal artistic aspects of the caves may also be seen to correspond to major aspects of Buddhist practice and observance and to the classification of the principal manifestations of the Buddha, known as the trikaya, or three bodies. At Xiangtangshan, the overlapping of the theme of Buddha's bodies with that of the bodies of emperors and courtiers indicates that the caves had political as well as religious significance and that they played an important role in the formation of the identity and ideology of the Northern Qi state.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Art History, Religious history, History, China",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

Dating from the period between the late fourth century and the late first century B.C., these texts circulated widely among local elites, who used them to determine auspicious times and places for the affairs of daily life. Through inductive analysis of the second century B.C. day-book manuscript found at Kongjiapo in Suizhou, Hubei in 1992, I consider the social circumstances of day-book compilation and usage, editorial conventions in manuscript production, and the implied cosmology underlying the various systems by which day books assigned auspicious or inauspicious qualities to times and directions. Close attention is given to the final 21 slips of the Kongjiapo day-book manuscript, a cosmological text called “Sui” (“Year”). This text is shown both to broaden our current conception of the early Chinese genre of yue ling (“monthly ordinances”) and to embody connections with other types of technical literature such as the well-known classic of Chinese medicine Huangdi neijing.

607927443,"Son, Suyoung",Writing for print: Zhang Chao and literati-publishing in seventeenth-century China,Modern,"My dissertation examines the private publishing practice of the literati in seventeenth-century China, and specifically the ways in which the material condition of print shaped literary production and consumption. While most current scholarship on the topic emphasizes the technological merit of print as the main reason for the replacement of manuscript by print, my study focuses on the complex interactions of cultural, economic, and political factors that constituted print as a distinctive medium as against the manuscript tradition. In early Qing China, at a time when print was fast becoming the dominant mode of transmitting texts but manuscript was still a viable mode of transmission, what determined the choice of print over manuscript? What kinds of cultural, economic, or social expectations distinguished print from manuscript? How was the technical function of print appropriated in terms of its cultural and social use? How did the choice of print transform the ways in which textuality was imagined, and what impact did this imagining have on the practice of writing and reading? My project, over four chapters, addresses these issues through a specific case study of a literatus-publisher of the seventeenth century, Zhang Chao (ca. 1650-1707). The first chapter, The Making of the Printed Text: Publishing and Literati Community, demonstrates that literati-publishers appropriated print not simply as a means to rapidly duplicate texts for wide dissemination, but rather as an extension of the manuscript culture in which production and circulation of texts promoted the exclusive status and privilege of the elite community. The second chapter, The Economics of Print: Money, Reputation, and the Book Market, not only challenges the allegedly rigid distinction between literati-publishing and commercial publishing but also goes further to demonstrate the inextricable interrelationship between the two in the literati's quest for fame, monetary gain, and social status. The third chapter, Print or Perish: Print, Transmission, and Immortality, uncovers the diverse and often contradictory responses of the literati toward the manuscript and print media and explains that the early Qing literati's preference for the print medium was determined by the social functions of mobility, publicity/celebrity, and preservation that the literati needed to develop and maintain if they were to continue to claim their distinctive cultural and social status. The fourth chapter, The Politics of Reading: Censorship, Transmission, and Interpretation, traces the censorship of Zhang Chao's printed texts and contends that both censorship campaigns of Emperor Qianlong in Qing China and King Choˇngjo in Chosoˇn Korea were attempts to subjugate the social and cultural effects of the literati-publishing to the political authority of each respective eighteenth-century regime. By looking at the ways in which early Qing literati-publishers dealt with the print medium, this dissertation demonstrates the social meanings of the print medium as residing in its interplay with manuscript in the changing literati identity, commercial book market, and political situations. The historical reconstruction of Zhang Chao's publishing practices sheds light on the complexity of the transition from manuscript to print by underscoring the nature of media and the acts of writing and reading as social endeavors in the cultural, economic, and political interactions in seventeenth-century China.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Asian literature, History, Asian Studies, China, Literati-publishing, Print culture, Seventeenth century, Seventeenth-century China, Zhang, Chao",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304783838,"Fischer, Paul A.",The formation of the “Shi Zi”,Ancient,"In this dissertation I analyze the formation of the Shi Zi, a text ostensibly dated to c.330bce. This formation includes its authorship, intertextuality, and transmission. Consideration of its authorship involves both the traditional notion of a single author creating one urtext and the current authorial paradigm of a polymorphous text that evolved out of disparate pericopes circulating independently. Its intertextuality explains some of the parallels between the Shi Zi and other early Chinese texts by positing a variety of ways an author may weave existing narrative into his work. Textual transmission always shapes early Chinese texts, but this influence is magnified for texts like the Shi Zi, which were lost and later reconstructed from other texts that quote it. For all these aspects of textual formation, the Shi Zi is an interesting case by which we may consider the several ways in which early Chinese texts were formed. Chapter One describes the content of the Shi Zi and reviews recent scholarship on it. Chapter Two traces the transmission of the Shi Zi from its earliest attestation, through its probable loss, down to its sixth extant reconstruction in 1812. Chapter Three explains the polymorphous text paradigm by constructing a methodological history of Authentication studies, a sub-field of textual criticism that determines textual authenticity. Chapter Four considers the authenticity of the Shi Zi by examining previous arguments for and against it. Chapter Five examines the theory of intertextuality for explaining some of the many textual parallels that occur among the Shi Zi and other early Chinese masters texts. By inquiring into the formation of the Shi Zi I hope to accomplish at least two things. First, I want to contribute to a more complex and more accurate conception of authorship and transmission for early Chinese texts in general. Second, I want to support the reintroduction of the Shi Zi into the study of early Chinese intellectual history. Further research on text formation and on other of the many lesser-known masters texts will yield a more detailed picture of the evolution of this kind of text and its relation to the intellectual concerns recorded in them.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, China, Intertextuality, Shi Zi, Text formation",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
305059810,"Lee, Hyun-Jeong",Reimagining the nation in Manchuria: The representation of peasant collectivity in Chinese and Korean discourses on the Wanbaoshan Incident (1931),Contemporary,"This dissertation explores how Chinese and Korean journalistic and literary discourses on the Wanbaoshan Incident construct nationhood through their representation of the peasant collectivity involved in the incident. The Wanbaoshan Incident, which transpired a few months before the 1931 Manchurian Incident, was a conflict between Chinese and Korean peasants in Manchuria over the construction of an irrigation route. In this dissertation, I examine the Chinese and Korean media coverage on the incident soon after it took place, and three literary works based on the incident that were written in the 1930s and 1940s. The journalistic and literary discourses on the Wanbaoshan Incident present diverse ways to imagine Chinese and Korean nationhood at different historical moments. While journalistic discourses signify the Wanbaoshan Incident from various positions in existing nationalist discourses, fictional narratives create new and alternative ways to configure Chinese or Korean nationhood at a time when existing ones were no longer valid in the international political context of East Asia. The Chinese novel Wanbaoshan portrays Chinese peasants as the proletarian class in the world, which represents a Marxist view of the Chinese nation diverging from existing Chinese nationalism. The Korean short story “Peasant” creates a way to envision the absent Korean nation from Manchuria during the late colonial period, when there hardly existed a positive vision of the Korean nation. The Korean novella Rice Plants constructs a new collective identity for Korean immigrants settling in Manchuria that is neither Korean nationalist nor necessarily pro-Japanese. The nature of the collective identity being constructed in each narrative is primarily determined by how the peasants are portrayed. Journalistic discourses mostly emphasize the innocent victimhood of the peasants, whereas in fictional narratives, the struggling peasants emerge as the collective protagonists of history, creating images of empowered nationhood. Moreover, in the fictional narratives, peasants’ unmediated experiences in Manchuria become the source of such empowerment. Among the peasants’ own experiences, most important is the confrontation between the Chinese and Korean peasants, antagonism for each other being their first response. The fictional narratives draw power from this antagonism and then construct new images of nationhood by overcoming or sublimating it while retaining the power it provides. These various and often alternative imaginations of Chinese and Korean nationhood are the products of the unusual historical juncture in East Asia in the 1930s and 1940s, when, due to Japan’s imperialist expansion, Chinese and Korean states were in serious crises, and the political configuration of Manchuria was undergoing many great changes. Thus, what this study ultimately explores are the diverse courses of modernity as it unfolded in modern East Asia.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Asian literature, History, China, Journalistic discourse, Korea, Literary discourse, Manchuria, Nationhood, Peasant, Wanbaoshan Incident",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304639298,"Stephenson, Shelley","The occupied screen: Star, fan, and nation in Shanghai cinema, 1937–1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation traces the history of film culture in the city of Shanghai during its eight-year occupation by Japan, 1937–1945. Organized around several of the primary sites of that culture—the journalistic film discourse, the city's cinemas, its star system, and the products exhibited on its film screens—the dissertation illuminates this disputed period of Asian film history by shifting the focus of critical attention away from the standard questions of Japanese imperialist ideology inherent in occupation film production. That production is instead examined from the perspective of its intended Chinese audience, with a particular focus on the urban milieu. Since audience identification in the cinema is typically channeled through the figure of the film star, the project centers upon Shanghai's cinematic star system and upon the fan press, one of the primary instruments by which it was maintained. At the core of the study are representations of two prominent figures from the city's star firmament during the time of occupation, Li Xianglan and Chen Yunshang. Within the pages of the fan magazine, Li's association with professionalism and with the Japanese imperialist project of pan-Asianism is contrasted with Chen's trajectory from the public world of stardom to the private space of marriage and domesticity. Interviews with both actresses reveal the continuing influence of these representations fifty years later. These interviews, along with interviews with other wartime stars, critics and fans, supplement the core archival research into fan and other popular periodicals. Throughout, the sources touch upon the well-rehearsed issues of politics and nation, issues which in the postwar era have come to define this period. Yet they also focus attention on discursive struggles around some less familiar themes in occupation Shanghai: gender, class, and modernity, each refracted through a notion of service to some larger community or idea. The dissertation explores the connections between these themes to argue that the city's cinema and its journalism, though based in the seemingly remote worlds of fantasy and image, in fact reveal the major social, cultural, and political contours of Shanghai's occupation history.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Motion Pictures, History, China, Cinema, Fan, Nation, Shanghai, Sino-Japanese War, Star",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304551826,"Wang, Richard G.",Creating artifacts: The Ming erotic novella in cultural practice,Modern,"For my dissertation, I take as the object of my study late Ming material culture, centering around the circulation of erotic fictional works. I focus on a group of mid-late Ming literary novellas. After the introduction to the novellas, the scholarship, and the main approach of this study in Chapter I, Chapter II sketches the production and consumption of the works. I deal with the publishing history of the novellas and their popularity at a material level, such as the typographical format of the works, their publishing patterns, and the edition system in terms of the book industry and trade. Chapter III explores the reading public by approaching reading practice and reader response during the late Ming period, arguing that the Ming erotic novella was intended for mass consumption. I also touch upon the issue of the cultural uses of the Ming erotic novella related to readership. In order to analyze the eroticism in the Ming novella, Chapter IV canvasses the Ming discourse on qing and sexuality in popular culture as testified to by the materials packaged together with the novellas in fiction miscellanies. In Chapter V, I first analyze the primacy of qing , its development, and problems in the novellas. Then I deal with the unfolding of sexual pleasure in the Ming novellas by examining how the issue is represented in these fictional works, and how these fictional works served social ideology. Chapter VI touches upon the issue of the religious dimension in the Ming novella. I argue that the Ming novellas are characterized by the pursuit of Daoist transcendence within the presentation of sexuality. Thus, I believe, the central theme of the novellas is the manifestation of double desires. Finally in Chapter VII, I conclude the thesis with a brief account of the influence of the Ming novellas on later fiction. The Ming novella also transmits its combination of sexual pleasure and religious salvation to later erotic novels. In this sense, the Ming novellas function as a cultural means and a religious alternative to the minds of common people.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Religious history, History, China, Cultural practice, Erotic novella, Ming, Novella",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
2002300335,"Stern, Robert","The Liberal Nomos of Empire: Extraterritoriality, Legal Orientalism, and the Universalization of Civilized International Law in China",Contemporary,"When and how did international law become a universal order applicable to all states on the earth? Existing scholarship has framed the universalization of international law in one of two ways. Traditionally, scholars have analyzed this legal process with reference to European global imperial expansion during the nineteenth-century and the concomitant legal domination of non-European societies. More recently, however, scholars have analyzed this process of legal universalization with reference to non-European states’ legal resistance to European imperial domination, and specifically their critical re-appropriation of European international law as an anti-imperial counter-discourse. This historiographical opposition, I argue, was mirrored in an historical opposition between nineteenth-century European imperial jurisprudence and non-European anti-imperial jurisprudence. Viewed together, historically, these discursive oppositions raise heretofore largely overlooked questions about the kinds of global practices that underpinned the universalization of modern international law, and rendered its attendant imperial/anti-imperial counter discourses equally plausible to both sides. My proposed book analyzes the historical nature and significance of those practices through an investigation of the global spread and deepening of commodity exchange relations, which, I argue, necessitated a particular liberal form of private law and rights-bearing legal subject. That liberal form of private law structured the historical constitution of nineteenth-century public law, including, most significantly, modern “universal” international law. It did so by supplying and lending legal legitimacy to the latter’s core liberal normative assumptions, rendering their derivative legal-jurisprudential imperial and anti-imperial discourses plausible to both European and non-European legal actors. It is in this critical frame, I argue, that we should understand the dual nature and significance of modern liberal international law, and the paradoxical historical trajectories borne out through its universalization.",2017,2017,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,History,History,"Asian Studies, History, International law, China, European imperialism, International law, Legal universalization",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304541715,"Han, Yelong",Making China part of the globe: The impact of America's Boxer Indemnity remissions on China's academic institutional building in the 1920s,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines modern China's movement to study abroad, marked by the inception of the Boxer Indemnity education program in 1909 with funding from America's first indemnity remission, and the impact of the movement on China's academic institutional building in the 1920s. From the perspective of a global movement of ideas and knowledge, in which individual Chinese who took part in this movement proved themselves to be active, engaging players, rather than passive imitators or followers of Western ideas, the author attempts to explore how, and to what degree, Western education affected Chinese students' perceptions of themselves and the outside world, and how such changing perceptions affected the development of modern China's academic institutional building in the 1920s. The author contends that the direct and extensive government involvement of the Boxer Indemnity education program created much space, in which the mutual benefits of this program were romanticized and materialized through the imaginations by people at different levels of society. The imaginations and expectations not only affected the academic performance and life experiences of a large number of Chinese students in America, especially those sponsored by the indemnity funds, but also proved to have strong repercussions in the 1920s, when Western-educated Chinese students began to return home continuously in large numbers and formed a rather special cohort in Chinese society. Parallel to the social repercussions, the 1920s also witnessed Qinghua's transformation from a preparatory school into a national university and the creation of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. Both events, the author argues, best illustrate the immediate outcome of Western education and represent the beginning of the continuous and conscious efforts of a new and confident generation of Western-educated Chinese to integrate China into the world academic and science community. Because of the political and economic disparity between China and the United States and the powerful Chinese nationalistic sentiment in the 1920s, the process of such efforts was marked by constant conflict within Chinese society, involving at once absorption, integration, cooperation, and resistance.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Bilingual education, Multicultural education, History, American history, History, Academic institutional building, Boxer Indemnity, China, Study abroad, World integration",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304639535,"Fiskesjo, Nils Magnus Geir",The fate of sacrifice and the making of Wa history,Contemporary,"This dissertation is concerned with Wa history and the conditions of its autonomy, and examines the Wa sacrificial rituals as the vehicles of this history. The Mon-Khmer speaking Wa inhabit a region between China and Southeast Asia, divided by the modern Burma-China border since the mid-20th century. The central Wa were formerly fiercely autonomous while the Wa peripheries were ruled indirectly, mostly by small Shan Buddhist kingdoms. The region's history is reviewed, to show how the central Wa came to be constituted as a particular kind of autonomous polities. The surrounding “civilized” polities, especially China, saw the central Wa as an external, “barbarian” zone. But the Wa were simultaneously deeply implicated in the same realms of socio-economic interconnections that sustain the Chinese and other states, mainly through trade in cash crops like opium but also through mining ventures and their consequences. However, in previous interpretive frameworks addressing the dichotomies of lowland civilizations and highland “primitive” zones characterizing the entire region, the historical agency of the people of the peripheries, and their attempts to marshal the resources of the land on their own terms, remains largely ignored. The historical forms of violence for which the Wa people were known in the past, the sacrificial rituals of headhunting, should be interpreted not as the inevitable outcome of fateful processes, but as the vehicles of the making of Wa history as culturally constituted action. The text draws on ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological data from investigations in Wa areas in China during 1996-1998 of the fortified settlements and other aspects of the militarized social landscape of the formerly autonomous central areas before the 1950s, as well as their more recent transformation into a peasant periphery.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, Archaeology, History, Burma, China, Sacrifice, Wa",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

During the early nineteenth century, the Qing administration was beginning to pursue a more aggressive policy of frontier expansion and Chinese literati were developing a colonial consciousness. The dissertation is divided into two parts. Part one deals with the historical contingencies and institutional contexts of incorporating Kavalan into the territorial organization of the administrative state. I try to show that although the imperialism of the Qing Empire was often aggressive and even destructive to its neighbors, its expansion was constrained by its limited financial and administrative capacity to incorporate new districts. The second half of the dissertation investigates the discursive practices of locality formation in three areas: customs ( fengsu ), geography ( dili or fengshui ), and landscape ( fengjing ). They are all intimately related to the discourse of imperial government. A magistrate investigated the customs to understand the mores of a community and the effect of his rule (chapter 4). he studied wind and earth to evaluate the geographic formation and living condition of a district (chapter 5). and he discovered beautiful landscape and identified them as the famous sites for local literati to assemble and inspect (chapter 6). Customs, geography, landscape were all moving and shifting spheres of interface between geography and humanity.

304796490,"Wu, Yiching","The other cultural revolution: Politics and practice of *class in the Chinese Cultural Revolution, 1966–1969",Contemporary,"My dissertation is a study of the development and political significance of various forms of social protest during the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. It seeks to develop a new interpretation of the Cultural Revolution, by opening up a space in which an alternative history of the movement—one which attends more to internal differentiations and critical possibilities-can be written. Addressing questions pertaining to class and identity formation, hegemonic processes, and counter-hegemonic possibilities, it explores how resistance or ruptural moments may develop, political boundaries may be reinterpreted and contested, and transgressive forces reworked or partially appropriated. The Cultural Revolution began in 1966 largely as a revolution from above which, while requiring much mass mobilization, was dependent upon highly centralized political direction. The disorder unleashed by revolts from below and power struggle on the top, however, created a genuine political crisis, and a potentially revolutionary situation. My dissertation examines protest activities by various marginalized and excluded segments of China's laboring population, whose social conditions were symptomatic, in rather condensed fashion, of broader class relations characteristic of Chinese society—e.g., temporary and contract laborers, rusticated urban youths, and youths from undesirable class backgrounds. Based on archival and field research, I explore the political dynamics of radicalizing the Cultural Revolution from below, through documenting and analyzing several key instances of popular socioeconomic grievances and their political expressions. Through these currents, dominant forms of social representation were scrutinized, and new forms of political critique arose that transgressed and challenged the hegemonic boundaries of the Cultural Revolution. In excavating these lesser known instances in their local mobilizational contexts, My dissertation attempts to offer new insights into the study of the Chinese Cultural Revolution with newly available materials, and hopes to contribute to the understanding of broader theoretical and political issues as well.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, Social structure, China, Class, Class and class formation, Cultural Revolution, Popular movement, Social protest, Socialism and postsocialism, Subalternity",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304406264,"Osburg, John L.",Engendering wealth: China's new rich and the rise of an elite masculinity,Contemporary,"Engendering Wealth examines the rise of elite networks composed of nouveau riche entrepreneurs and government officials in contemporary China. These powerful new groups have exerted increasing dominance over many aspects of Chinese commerce and politics during the reform era, the period of China's economic liberalization that began in the late 1970's. The dissertation considers these networks, which are composed mostly of men, as gendered social formations governed by moral economies of brotherhood, loyalty, and patronage. Based on ethnographic data gathered during nearly three years of fieldwork in the city of Chengdu, it analyzes the ways in which relationships are formed between elite men through shared experiences of leisure—banqueting, drinking, singing karaoke, and cavorting with female hostesses—and the importance of these relationships in organizing their business ventures and orienting their personal values. This masculinization of the sphere of private business and deal-making in China has also generated challenges for female entrepreneurs, who are often accused of using their sexuality to get ahead, and given rise to a new class of young women who live off the patronage of China's new rich businessmen and corrupt state officials. These young women are central to mediating relationships and mirroring status among elite men and are integral to the emergence of a growing, semi-legitimate beauty economy in urban China. Ethnographic examples are drawn from work as the host of a provincial Chinese television show, experiences with an underground criminal brotherhood in Chengdu, published confessional interviews with corrupt officials, personal narratives of women who participate in the beauty economy, interviews with male and female entrepreneurs, and countless evenings accompanying businessmen as they entertained clients and government officials. Engendering Wealth argues that elite networks in China transcend any neat boundaries between state and society, and they mobilize official and unofficial resources as well as legitimate and illegitimate forms of authority. This dissertation suggests that visions of a retreating totalitarian state, a growing civil society, and an ever-expanding, neoliberal market economy are inadequate for accounting for the complexity of power relations and new forms of inequality in contemporary China.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, Social structure, Gender studies, Chengdu, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, Elite, Elites, Entrepreneurs, Guanxi (networks), Masculinity, New rich, Wealth",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304793078,"Wang, Jingbin","Hegemony and revolution: An odyssey toward the Sino-American rapprochement, 1943–1972",Contemporary,"This dissertation seeks to reexamine three decades of relations between the United States and Mao's China with a view to throwing new light on the causes of the Sino-American rapprochement in 1971-72 in the larger context of the global confrontation between liberalism and communism. I approach the issue between these two states as one of diplomatic recognition. I am concerned with the question of why a hegemonic great power chose to move toward recognition of a revolutionary state later rather than earlier while the revolutionary state opposed what it viewed as the arch imperialist power and desired its recognition at the same time. Much has been written about the worldwide struggle between liberal democracy and communism, but from the American vantage point. This dissertation adopts a world-historical approach, anchoring the two traditions in efforts to reform and revolutionize the nation-state system with emphasis on their effects on bilateral diplomatic relations. Similarly, it is recognized that the United States had long refused to recognize the Beijing government, and it was China's state policy to establish diplomatic relations with all other countries in the world, including the United States. Yet these two facts have been obscured by the general tendency to subsume diplomatic recognition under an ideological or a strategic perspective. I address diplomatic recognition in its own right and consider the U.S. and Chinese recognition policies together within one conceptual framework informed by the liberal and the Marxist-Leninist traditions. This study does not downplay strategic calculations either in Washington or in Beijing. On the contrary, I hope to demonstrate that the United States had consistently adopted a strategic approach to China from confrontation to rapprochement, but from a liberal standpoint. Power mattered, but realism was not relevant. Much the same could be said of China, including the Soviet Union.

304466498,"Shim, Jae-hoon",The early development of the state of Jin: From its enfeoffment to the hegemony of Wen Gong (r. 636-628 B.C.),Medieval,"This study deals with how and why the state of Jin became the most powerful state of all China by the latter half of the seventh century B.C. Utilizing the archaeological and inscriptional sources discovered recently in Shanxi, this dissertation focuses on the relationship between Zhou and Jin and the transition of that relationship as the main impetus for the development of Jin. The Duke of Zhou enfeoffed Jin in southwestern Shanxi with the hope of withstanding the challenges not from the Rong and Di but from the remaining pro-Shang powers there. The material culture represented by the Beizhao cemetery of the Jin lords clearly shows that Jin was very closely bound to Zhou culture during the Western Zhou period. The “Jin Hou Su bianzhong ” inscription from the same site also attests to the close relationship between the Zhou king and Lord Su of Jin. Jin Wen Hou (r. 780–746 B.C.) further played a critical role in the eastward evacuation of King Ping. It was however not until the usurpation of the junior branch of Quwo in 679 B.C. that the state of Jin was freed from the influence of Zhou and thus developed into a very progressive regional power. Entering into a new, closer relationship with the non-Zhou people and conquering all other feudal states of Zhou in southwestern Shanxi, Xian Gong (r. 676–651 B.C.) provided the most important background for the hegemony of Jin. Jin Wen Gong, succeeding in reforming the state, became Premier of all China and eventually eclipsed Jin's former patron Zhou. Therefore, whereas the early development of Jin can be attributed in considerable part to its close relationship with Zhou, its elimination of Zhou authority in Shanxi paradoxically made possible its rise to become the most powerful state of all China in the latter half of the seventh century B.C.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, Archaeology, China, Enfeoffment, Jin, Seventh century B.C., Wen Gong",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

913389862,"Orell, Julia C.",Picturing the Yangzi River in Southern Song China (1127–1279),Medieval,"This dissertation presents a study of Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279) handscroll paintings depicting the Yangzi River. I focus on three long handscrolls that offer detailed, continuous views of scenery along either the river's entire course or large stretches of it and that feature inscribed place names. These Yangzi River handscrolls have been recognized as the earliest extant depictions of the river and as among the earliest extant Chinese topographical landscape paintings in a portable format. My study disassociates the paintings from the role of passive documents of physical reality assigned to them in existing scholarship and instead situates them within a larger field of inquiry to show how topographical landscape painting interacts with other cultural practices in the production of geographical knowledge. The Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279) was a time of intense engagements with historical and cultural geography and a time of new articulations of ordering and representing geographical knowledge in a variety of textual and visual media and genres that include encyclopedias, atlases and maps, (illustrated) local and comprehensive gazetteers, travel writing, and poetry. One result of my investigation is to identify different cultural milieus and agendas for the production of the individual Yangzi River handscrolls and the range of significances associated with the river and its depiction within the framework of cultural and historical geography. Chapter One shows, based on textual sources, that the Yangzi River became a popular subject in painting during the 13th century and studies the themes associated with it at the time, which include returning home and farewell, a historical interest in sites and regions, and political sentiments. Chapter Two offers a stylistic and connoisseurly analysis of three early extant Yangzi River handscrolls that I combine with an account of their history of reception. Chapter Three continues with a close visual analysis of the three scrolls' representational strategies and the role of the inscribed place names. I situate these observations within a larger examination of visual and textual representations of place and region in painting, cartography, printed illustrations, local and comprehensive gazetteers, travelogues, and poetic articulations of personal and political geographies. First of all, I show that the category of topographical painting used in modern scholarship has no equivalent in historical categorizations of Chinese painting. In addition, distinctions between landscape painting, maps, and gazetteer illustrations were not consistently made but rather depended on individual contexts, agendas, and their respective systems of categorizations. Secondly, based on the close visual analysis of the Yangzi River handscrolls in relation to supporting visual and textual sources, I conclude that the three individual handscrolls belong to the three different realms of a) official, imperial geography. b) local historical geography. and c) personal geography of notable sites.

This dissertation examines five case studies in order to both reach a renewed understanding of Sino-Tibetan synthesis and illuminate different aspects of the process through which these traditions coalesced during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Approaching these temples as both sites of political propagation and cultural negotiation, I argue that in order to explore the formation of this distinct synthetic visual vocabulary one must focus on contextual factors such as the significance of sponsorship and geographical location, rather than on exclusively formal issues of style and iconography, which have traditionally dominated the field. Documentary evidence suggests that these temples, while found primarily along the Sino-Tibetan border, are the products of both imperial and local patronage. Thus I argue that the primary distinction to be made in the development of Sino-Tibetan wall painting in the temples I am considering is not between metropolitan or provincial locations and visual idioms, but rather between imperial and local programs of sponsorship. I also consider the corresponding rise of Tibetan interest in Chinese visual modes within these same local contexts, focusing on the development of the Tenth Karma-pa's Chinese style thang-ka painting.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, Art history, Buddhist, China, Ethnicity, Ming dynasty, Painting, Sino-Tibetan, Tibetan",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
305415582,"Sena, David M.",Reproducing society: Lineage and kinship in Western Zhou China,Ancient,"This dissertation examines lineages in China during the Western Zhou period based on inscriptions on bronze ritual vessels considered in the full light of their archaeological context. Rather than approaching lineages through the abstract idealizations of kinship presented in classical texts, this dissertation examines lineages through the textual and material remains of cultural practices undertaken by actual individuals and groups in particular contexts. By focusing on such artifacts, this dissertation aims to reconstruct both the history of particular lineages and a concept of lineage as it was manifest in the practice of ancestor worship, funerary ritual, and political patronage by Western Zhou elite. In case studies of three important lineages, I reconstruct the identities and interrelationships of lineage members through an analysis of personal names in inscriptional texts. Relating these reconstructions to archaeological sites, I map out lineage growth in time and space and suggest a model for the growth and diversification of lineages. Chapter One consists of a study of naming conventions based on inscriptions relating to the Shan lineage. Investigating the various appellation formats used for deceased ancestors and living descendants, this chapter demonstrates that personal names encode relationships underlying fundamental social, religious, and political institutions. Chapter Two examines differentiation within lineages on the basis of inscriptions and archaeological sites associated with the Guo lineage, showing that lineages were complex institutions that maintained ties among distinct and regionally differentiated branches. Chapter Three examines the political nature of lineages through a reconstruction of the Jing lineage, showing that its growth and diversification were closely related to political developments within the royal court. In addition to providing reconstructions of three important lineages, this dissertation shows that lineages were robust social and political groups that functioned to regulate and organize the growth and reproduction of elite families as well as to provide the Zhou royal house a measure of control in that process. This dissertation is significant for its refinement in the methodology for working with personal names in inscriptions and because it presents a model for the investigation of Western Zhou social history through contemporary textual and material artifacts.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, Bronze inscriptions, China, Kinship, Lineage, Paleography, Western Zhou dynasty",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

1426181937,"Winter, Smadar",Motherhood in early China,Ancient,"This dissertation studies the practices and ideologies that shaped motherhood in China in the period spanning the Shang through the Han dynasties. By demonstrating that much cultural attention was dedicated to articulating, negotiating, and establishing the meanings and the limits of the maternal role, this dissertation counters prevailing scholarly opinions about motherhood in early China and participates in a growing effort to write the history of women and gender relations. It exposes aspects of the lived experience of early Chinese women and contributes to a better understanding of how early Chinese gender identities were historically constructed. Current scholarly opinions about motherhood in early China range widely, with some scholars holding that it was ignored, and others presenting it as similar to fatherhood, or likewise as a position of great power. Drawing on oracle bones and bronze inscriptions, historical documents, ritual manuals, didactic essays, as well as philosophical writings, legal materials, poetic expressions, and medical manuscripts, this dissertation charts a different course. It shows that motherhood was neither ignored, nor perceived as undifferentiated from fatherhood, nor highly elevated, but rather that it was always described – and prescribed – in relation to a larger, stronger, and more important patriarchal, patrilineal, social order. The Introduction discusses why motherhood has only recently become a topic for study in the West and the reasons for the limited scope of studies of early Chinese motherhood. It surveys previous Western and Chinese studies of motherhood in early China, as well as general studies of women in early China that contain material about early Chinese mothers. Chapter One surveys late Shang and Western Zhou inscribed bronze vessels made for, or by, mothers. It shows that mothers received more sacrifice than women occupying other roles in the family, but nevertheless that considerable gaps existed between the amount – and the significance – of sacrifice offered to female and male ancestors. The chapter also identifies three genealogies alongside the sanctioned genealogy between fathers and sons: genealogies between mothers and daughters, including transmission of wealth. between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. and between mothers and sons. Chapter Two examines rites and rituals of mourning, marriage, and birth included in the Yi li and the Li ji. It shows that ritual practices defined motherhood as inferior, conditioned, mediated, or even created, by fathers. Ritual regulations also weakened motherhood by dividing it between many care-takers and by establishing the bond between father and son as the main affective bond in the family. Chapter Three analyzes historical accounts of mothers and motherhood in the Zuo zhuan and the Lie nü zhuan. It shows mothers as agents of transformation, early educators, and remonstrators to their sons, but also as possible threats. All these roles were structured to acknowledge but limit the power of mothers. In delineating various constructions of motherhood, this dissertation deepens our knowledge not only of early Chinese women but also of the structure, organization, ideals and realities of broader society in early China.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"History, Asian Studies, Gender studies, China, Gender identity, Motherhood",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
822775373,"Relyea, Scott",Gazing at the Tibetan Plateau: Sovereignty and Chinese state expansion in the early twentieth century,Contemporary,"This dissertation explores continuities in the expanding Chinese state's endeavour to incorporate its southwest borderlands from the last years of the Qing dynasty into the first decade of the Republic of China, complementing recent scholarship which explores the transformation over the first half of the 20th century of the Qing Empire into a Chinese state. Geographically, the text focuses on the Kham region of cultural Tibet, a vast borderland of high mountains and narrow river valleys situated between and coveted in the early twentieth century by both central Tibet and Sichuan Province. By integrating first-hand accounts penned by officials, soldiers, gentry, missionaries, and adventurers, Chinese, Tibetan, and foreign, with an analysis of the policies implemented by diverse military, governmental, and economic actors into a narrative of events in Kham from roughly 1904 to the conclusion of the Nine Power Treaty in 1922, this work offers a detailed history of a crucial period in the emergence of the Chinese state while simultaneously presenting a comprehensive picture of the social and political circumstances of a region at the edge of Chinese and Tibetan space. This work further analyses the transformation during the early twentieth century of the Sino-Tibetan relationship prompted by the introduction of the globalising norms of sovereignty and territoriality, situating contemporary irredentism in these Tibetan borderlands, as manifest during demonstrations stretching from Lhasa to Kham in early 2008, in the incomplete implementation of these policies during the transition from imperial to state space in a process which I call infrontier imperialism. The military campaigns, bureaucratisation, and myriad 'civilising' reforms implemented most effectively by the Qing general Zhao Erfeng, known to Tibetans as the 'Butcher of Kham', and mirrored less successfully by successive Republican administrations of Sichuan and its borderlands, claimed a long imperial pedigree. Yet the essence and effects of these policies, which comprise the first two stages of infrontier imperialism, were transformed in the early 20th century in the burgeoning global climate of nation-states imbued with sovereignty, the concept which evoked the last stage of infrontier imperialism, the conversion of Kham into a province. Synthesising imperial and modern, these policies, which resonate even today, included the replacement of imperially-invested local chieftains with centrally-appointed bureaucratic officials, the exploitation of mineral resources through mining, the migration of farmers from Sichuan's Red Basin to agricultural colonies coupled with the formation of experimental farms on the plateau, the initiation of industrial production utilising local products, and the establishment of schools and the inculcation of new social norms to transform and acculturate the Khampas. Bolstered by initial military action and the continued presence on the plateau of Sichuanese soldiers, however tenuous, these myriad policies were at their core intended to weaken the local power of monasteries and thereby the spiritual and rival political influence of Lhasa in Kham. Geographical and political challenges exposed by diverse countervailing forces at the global, imperial or state, and local levels transected these efforts, frustrating the incorporation of Kham into the bureaucratic structure of the Chinese state at a time when the region was perceived by both Chengdu and Beijing as a stepping stone toward encompassing the whole of Tibet. A stark contrast existed between the late Qing and early Republican governments' real exercise of authority on the plateau at the local level and the largely performative aspects of that authority at the imperial or state level deployed to legitimate claims to sovereignty over Kham and Tibet to the global community. The emergence of nation-states and the accompanying tenets of sovereignty in the first decades of the 20th century had transformed long-standing policies of bureaucratisation and acculturation once invoked by expanding Chinese empires into tools for absorbing these same borderlands into the nascent Chinese state. Yet this dissertation argues that the persistent inability of the Qing and Republican governments to exert effective control over the diverse polities comprising Kham during these crucial decades of state formation, coupled with the incomplete implementation of the bureaucratic and transformative endeavours noted above, exacerbated an underlying tension between the political and the spiritual in the competition for authority in Kham among local leaders, Lhasa, Chengdu, and Beijing which persists even to this day.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, International Relations, Borderlands, China, Kham, Sichuan, Sovereignty, State expansion, Tibet",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
1619356873,"Teh, Limin","Mining for differences: Race, Chinese labor, and Japanese colonialism in Fushun Coalmine, 1907-1945",Contemporary,"Almost four decades of Japanese colonial rule transformed Fushun Coalmine in Manchuria into a major source of energy for the Japanese Empire, and the town into an industrial city with burgeoning auxiliary industries. At the same time, these indicators of growth and modernization belie an uneven distribution of dividends based on a racial hierarchy explicitly expressed in the rhetoric of Japanese colonialism, and implicitly embedded in the company's labor management practices. Every aspect of labor management—from the hiring and supervision of Chinese migrant workers to determining wages and job classification—aimed at reproducing this racial hierarchy that sat at the heart of Japanese colonial domination. This hierarchy enabled Japanese managers to suppress labor costs and raise labor productivity without jeopardizing the privileges they enjoyed as colonial elites. So central was this racial logic of Japanese colonial rule that Fushun's urban space was fragmented into racially segregated enclaves. This micro-history of Chinese labor in Japanese-controlled Fushun Coalmine seeks to reorient discussion about the origins of Chinese industrial modernity away from the traditional coastal treaty ports of Shanghai and Tianjin and to the peripheral region of Manchuria. The experience of a coal mining town's modernization under Japanese colonial rule also illuminates a critical shift in the history of colonialism in the twentieth century, in which economic development, not subjugation and marginalization became an instrument of asserting dominance.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, Labor relations, Ethnic studies, China, Colonial industrialization, Japanese colonialism, Manchuria, Migrant labor, Mining",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

304277674,"Lafleur, Robert Andre","A rhetoric of remonstrance: History, commentary, and historical imagination in Sima Guang's Zizhi tongjian",Medieval,"An eleventh-century chronicle history covering 1,362 years of China's past, from 403 BCE to CE 959, Sima Guang's (1019-1086) Zizhi tongjian was part of a long tradition of Chinese historical-writing. Although its influence on Chinese historiography has been enormous, it has been used by Chinese, Japanese, and Western historians as a reference work far more than it has been read as a narrative of Chinese history. The text's prodigious length, and the ease with which historical materials can be referenced in it, are two reasons for the lack of attention given to the text's broader narrative sweeps. Yet it is apparent from Sima Guang's letters and memorials, as well as a preface written by Emperor Shenzong (r. 1067-1085), that the Zizhi tongjian was originally perceived in a very different way--as an imperial textbook for the moral edification of the ruler and his ministers. The accessibility of the text and the requirements of modern historical research have obscured this significant aspect of the work. There is a strong discursive element in even a work of history so self-consciously linear as the Zizhi tongjian. Many of the text's entries are didactic. they provide a form of moral mensuration from which later officials could learn. They presented a background for discussing how government not only was in the documented past, but also how it should be. Much of the text consists of what some historians have called extraneous material. The chronicle is interspersed with lengthy commentaries and memorials that give color to the events related in the text. It is from these materials that the text's didacticism is generated. they constitute the central dynamic of the Zizhi tongjian's historiography. What this form of historiography amounts to is a representation of the Chinese past from original documents, and a commentary upon that past as it might have been. Sima Guang's historiography pointed to relationships between classical ideal, historical example, and contemporary political dilemmas--a work that encouraged the careful reader to think through problems of ruling that, from the perspective of the author, were as relevant to Song dynasty readers as those of earlier periods.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, China, Song dynasty",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
1722272410,"Meyskens, Covell Franklin","Maoist China's hinterland war machine: The Cold War, industrial modernity, and everyday life in China's Third Front, 1964-1980",Contemporary,"This study analyzes China’s Third Front campaign (1964-80) to create a heavy industrial base in remote areas of western China that would be safe from American and Soviet bombers in the event that the Cold War turned hot. Between 1964 and 1980, China mobilized 13 million workers and devoted 40 percent of its capital construction budget to this huge industrialization campaign. The Third Front is at least important to Maoist China as the Cultural Revolution and yet scholars in the West know almost nothing about it. At present, Western scholarship largely depends on two academic articles by Barry Naughton. Due to limited sources, Naughton’s articles could not fully address how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) constructed the Third Front. Nor could they adequately analyze its social and economic effects. This dissertation provides the first history of what is still one of China’s largest military industrial complexes. This study resituates the Third Front in the context of the Cold War. With the exception of diplomatic history, most studies of Maoist China have not taken the Cold War as a major category of analysis. Researchers have instead focused on processes internal to China and examined villages and coastal cities. This investigation elaborates a new framework for understanding the relationship between China and the Cold War. In so doing, it shows the decisive impact that the Cold War had on Chinese social life and economic affairs. This new framework also illustrates that to understand the Cold War’s influence on China, it is necessary for researchers to shift their analytical gaze away from the coast to China’s western hinterlands. This study shows that like the Americans and Soviets, China assumed that the Cold War might turn into open warfare in the near future. In preparation for this imaginary conflict, the CCP constructed industry in the same kind of secluded locations that had housed Communist defenses during World War II. In this regard, the CCP followed the long tradition of military leaders fighting the next war as if it were the last war. In the end, the Third Front led to a massive expansion of industrial infrastructure in western China. This dissertation thus challenges the widely-held viewpoint that China lost a decade of development due to the Cultural Revolution. The CCP’s commitment to large-scale economic engineering was widespread in both the capitalist and socialist world during the Cold War. Like many similar projects, Third Front industrialization came at an enormous human and environmental cost. Following the Soviet Union, the CCP pushed to rapidly enlarge its heavy industrial base in order to strengthen its geopolitical position. Short on industrial capital, the CCP substituted huge inputs of manual labor. The CCP did not only try to replace industrial capital with more readily accessible materials. Like the Soviet Union, China suppressed the development of a consumer goods sector for the sake of heavy industrial expansion and exchanged thought campaigns for proper food, water, and shelter. This decision caused China to have a very different experience of the Cold War than much of the capitalist world, where governments tended to implement pro-consumer policies to obtain popular support. To boost morale, the CCP organized thought campaigns which aimed to make people embrace Maoism’s ethic of hard work and deferred gratification for the sake of socialist China’s industrialization and defense. This collective narrative did not silence discontent, and yet despite their misgivings, participants still built the Third Front due to a mix of commitment and compulsion. Similar to participants in Soviet projects, Third Fronters developed means of coping with scarcity and finding meaning amidst harsh living conditions. But, few ever came to see Maoist China’s hinterland war machine as their permanent home.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,History,History,"History, Economic history, China, Cold War, Everyday life, Industrialization, National security, Socialism",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304078827,"Mazur, Mary Gale","A man of his times: Wu Han, the historian",Contemporary,"This biography examines the life of a post May Fourth Chinese intellectual, the historian, Wu Han (1909-1969), in the context in which he lived. Among the questions probed are: this man's participation during crucial years of China's transition to modernity in facets of social change and changes in the nation's political direction, and the corresponding resonation of politics and social change in his own life. and the relationship of historical scholarship and politics in his life and how this changed with events. These issues meant internal conflict for him, as for most intellectuals, and as well as within the entire society during this tumultuous era. That commentators' interpretations of Wu have differed in response to currents relative to the context of their own periods is discussed. The study is presented in a discursive narrative biography covering the period from his birth to appointment as Vice Mayor of Beijing (1949), which situates his life in the context of the momentous social and political changes in China. A conjoint separate chapter biography treats the revolutionary early life of his wife and her family as background for their relationship and her influence on him. Wu pioneered the modern historical study of the Ming Dynasty in the 1930's, becoming widely recognized in the 1940's as a popular historian and political essayist. During the Sino-Japanese War, in the evolving environment of the Second United Front, transformed from a pure scholar as a leftist intellectual he devoted his support to the Democratic Movement within the United Front framework through his membership in the left centrist Democratic League. Having proved himself as a political activist, after the Guomindang defeat, he was appointed as an official of the Party-State in the United Front coalition established by the Chinese Communist Party in 1949.

304247432,"Wang, Huiyun",Comparing discourses on tradition and modernization: Sun Yat-sen's and Gandhi's perspectives on social change,Contemporary,"This comparative study of Sun Yat-sen's and Gandhi's perspectives on social change, as well as modernist discourses in China and India analyzes why modernization is shaped by different cultural traditions, social settings and historical realities. Using social and cultural settings as independent variables and social change as dependent variables, the dissertation explains why modernity turns out to be a universal theme while modernization appears problematic in the two countries. Taking Sun Yat-sen's experience as a microcosm of his generation of intellectual and political elites in search of modernity and Gandhi's critique of modernity as a search for alternatives to modernization, the dissertation presents contesting discourses articulated by Chinese and Indian intellectual and political elites with analyses of the specific historical realities and cultural traditions that influence those discourses. Critical of cultural imperialism, the author of the dissertation tries to read the modernist discourses in China and India in their specific historical context. Interpreting the different approaches to social change adopted by Chinese and Indian intellectual and political elites, the dissertation explains how tradition has influenced the collective intellectual preference and modernization processes in the two countries. The dissertation reaches the conclusion that traditional culture, transforming and adapting itself from time to time, constantly influences the development of society in different historical moments, and modernization at micro-level is not the same for all nations and for all time. As different nations have different cultural traditions, social settings and historical realities, the Third World countries can not simply copy the modern West but should have more alternatives to westernization.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, History, Political science, China, Gandhi, Mohandas K.@, India",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
305096479,"Lan, Shi-Chi","Changing relations: China and Taiwan, 1931–1947",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the ways in which Taiwan and its relations with the nation of China were defined discursively and behaviorally across China's territorial acquisition of Taiwan of 1945. It employs Etienne Balibar's distinction between the “internal border”—the conceptual contour of a nation—and the “external border”—the territorial boundary of the land in which a nation inhabits—to study the demarcation of China as a nation and its relations with Taiwan. This dissertation finds that the ways Taiwan was defined as outside China's internal border in both narratives and practice before 1945 or defined as inside China's internal border in narratives after 1942 were positively correlated to China's actual or projected external border. This process of changing definitions of Taiwan and its relations with China's internal border showed that the definition of China as a nation and the Taiwan-China relations were contingent upon what I call the “institutional conditioning” by China's external border. Furthermore, this dissertation finds that in practice, the persistence of the pre-1942 internal border of China after 1945 prevented the hardening of a new postwar internal border that would define Taiwan as inside. The result was that the Taiwanese became treated as lesser national denied of right in legal and political affairs under the KMT rule and as the “internal other” inside China's external border but deprived of rights of nation. It showed that the “institutional conditioning” was highly effective in discursive realm, but in practice it was much less effective since the internal border of a nation was not necessarily defined in full congruence with the institutional boundary or the external border of a nation. Such constraint of the institutional boundary in defining national boundaries showed the limit of “institutional conditioning” in practice, or what I call the “institutional constraint”. The “institutional constraint” of nation-formation created a significant disjuncture between narratives and practices that defined the Taiwan-China relations, perpetuated the ambivalence of Chinese nationalism, and eventually paved way for the February 28 Event in Taiwan in 1947 and the ensuing conflict between Taiwan and China that continued beyond 1947.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, History, China, Nationalism, Taiwan",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304395046,"Shen, Zhijia","Zouping, 1911-1949: A social and political history",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the social and political developments of Zouping during the Republic of China, especially in three historical periods--the rural reconstruction era, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Civil War between the KMT and the CCP. This study approaches some broad historical questions, such as the local elite, the relationship between the CCP and the rural society, and the CCP land reform, from the perspective of the local population with a particular emphasis on the local responses to changes caused by the outside forces. This thesis argues that Liang Shuming's rural reconstruction program in Zouping was a success until the Japanese occupation. It brought immediate economic benefits to the local people and restored social and political order in the wracked countryside by reinstating leadership in the villages and by revitalizing the local elite to fill the political vacuum created by the collapse of the imperial order. Liang's theories and practices constituted a valuable attempt to provide an alternative path for China's modernization. This study has observed that, for the Zouping residents. the Sino-Japanese War was a bloody human struggle of survival, in which a person's decisions were motivated primarily by expediency rather than by ideology. Individuals' personal and familial survival strategies together with the various personal-relation networks tinctured with parochialism usually determined with which military group a person sided, be it the local militia, the CCP, or the Japanese occupation forces. As this study has also observed, the CCP land reform in Zouping accomplished more politically than economically. The miserable living conditions of the local people at the end of the Sino-Japanese War paradoxically created a favorable political climate and constituency in Zouping for the radically politicized CCP land reform. By using class labels to group the existing local elite with the KMT and by appealing to the desperate material needs of the poor, the CCP was able to stimulate a class struggle against the local elite, to mobilize the rural masses in support of its war, and eventually to replace the local elite with the new CCP local elite. Thus land reform laid the foundation in the vast countryside for the new social order that the CCP was to bring to China at the end of the Civil War.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, Social structure, China, Sino Japanese War, civil wars, rural reconstruction, social history, twentieth century",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
1667735313,"Werner, Jake","The making of mass society in Shanghai: The socialist transformation of everyday life, 1949-1958",Contemporary,"This study seeks to explain the emergence and ascendance of mass society in China through an investigation of everyday life in Shanghai across three turbulent decades. From the possibilities opened up by Jazz Age consumer culture in the early 1930s to the wholesale restructuring of work and culture under the Chinese Communist Party in the 1950s, the advent of mass society was centrally implicated in — and ultimately provided the resolution of — the long crisis of depression and war in China. By integrating large groups of people who had been marginalized, both socially and economically, into the industrial economy and a new culture of the masses, Communist Party rule after 1949 rapidly gained legitimacy and revived economic growth. Yet the process of integration into mass society also planted the seeds of future crises, as mass society's aesthetic of homogenization and standardization developed in tension with the occupational differentiation and regimentation required by the Party's developmental vision. Bringing together the methods of economic and cultural history, this dissertation explores the Party's vision of social transformation and how it was implemented on the complex social landscape of China's most important center of production, the city of Shanghai. I argue that to understand the 1950s, historians must move beyond an emphasis on the Communist Party's use of propaganda and repression. Mass society was not simply imposed by a domineering state upon a reluctant society, but emerged from a tangle of competing desires that were themselves reshaped through the encounter — converging around an increasingly standardized set of expectations and aspirations. The Party appealed to the powerful popular memory of the dysfunctional old society and offered in its stead a beautiful future that would be well-ordered and equitable, but which could only be reached through submission to the collective and to the imperative of expanding production. The possibility of such a future was rendered plausible at the grassroots not primarily by Party propaganda, but by a direct experience of the concrete material traces of mass society. Through a close examination of new work routines and forms of participation in the factories, popular involvement in new political ceremonies, and everyday conditions of residential life, this study shows how material practices, more than abstract ideology, gave form to mass society. I argue that this dynamic was not unique to Mao's China but part of a movement toward bureaucratizing economies and homogenizing cultures across the postwar world. China during the Mao period has often been cast as outside the movement of global history. This dissertation aims to restore China to its global context by identifying a convergence at the level of everyday life on both sides of the Cold War divide. Rationalization — of the production process and culture alike — was the watchword of the age, animating a worldwide pursuit of standardized mass production, technocratic economic administration, and a form of social inclusion premised on cultural conformity. The realization of these social forms was particularly pronounced in the People's Republic of China, throwing into relief the curious dual nature of the masses — at once an object of Party administration and an active political subject compelling the Party to repeatedly adjust its policy. The tensions embedded in the masses as a concept and as a practice suggest a new approach to the question of modernity in China. While the Mao period is often cast as a detour in the course of Chinese history, it is precisely the dynamic of reversal and reconstitution of the antinomies of modernity that most clearly marks twentieth century China as modern.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,History,History,"History, Labor relations, Urban planning, China, Chinese Communist Party, Mao, Socialism",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

The sources on which my analysis is founded are only those materials that date to the Western Zhou period, primarily bronze inscriptions, and the Kang gao and Jiu gao chapters of the Shangshu.

Chapter Two turns to legal theory as a means to outline those facets of legal systems addressed later in this study with regard to the Western Zhou. Chapter Three introduces the inscriptional sources, and also provides summaries of their contents as well as those of the Kang gao and Jiu gao. In Chapter Four, I look at the legal process, rules (both substantive and procedural), punishments, sources of law, and the legal bureaucracy. In Chapter Five, I situate the legal system in its cultural setting. In it, I suggest that the rhetoric and ritual of both warfare and religion among the aristocratic class played important roles in effectuating a valid legal system. In Chapter Six, I address the questions of whether the Western Zhou had a full-fledged legal system or simply a jural-like one, and what law was in the minds of the Western Zhou people. The application of methodologies employed and the subjects addressed are aimed at furthering our appreciation of a system that is generally glossed over in a manner that fails to take into account the mechanisms by which it exists and operates. I also hope that this study will help to enable cross-cultural and cross-temporal comparative studies involving Western Zhou law.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, Law, China",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
1270799062,"Wang, Fei-Hsien","Creating new order in the knowledge economy: The curious journey of copyright in China, 1868–1937",Contemporary,"Widespread piracy of intellectual property in modern-day China has convinced international legal scholars and policy makers that the Chinese not only lack awareness of intellectual property but also refuse to protect this internationally recognized doctrine. It seems natural to think that copyright law in China is a story of failure. But is it? This Dissertation shows that most scholars and commentators have neglected to see how copyright, an internationalizing doctrine, was actually received and enforced in pre-1949 China. Drawing upon a wide range of published and unpublished archival sources, including actual books (both authentic and pirated) produced during this period, this dissertation traces how the very concept of copyright became banquan (literally the right to printing blocks) in Chinese, and how it was understood, appropriated, and practiced as a new legal doctrine by the Chinese to declare ownership, define literary property, and create orders in a changing knowledge economy. In tracing this history, I argue that the concept of copyright should be seen not as a fixed and timeless legal term, but as a vessel that contains different meanings and values in different historical and cultural contexts. How historical actors understood and employed this concept is best seen in the practices and norms they associated with it rather than the letter of the law. Although new laws protecting copyright appeared constantly in China in the early twentieth century, these laws received minimal enforcement due to the weaknesses of the successive Chinese governments. This fact, however, did not prevent people from consistently invoking the concept of copyright to claim or to protect their own profits. Yet, each had their own interpretation of what copyright was and who should own it. Copyright/ banquan intertwined with pre-existing practices and notions of cangban (literally possessing printing blocks) in the xylography-based print cultures in late imperial China. As the result, it was understood as ownership of the means of production rather than ownership of abstract intellectual creation. The Shanghai Booksellers' Guild, I argue, was the only institution that managed to maintain a minimal protection of copyright between 1900s and 1950s. it did so primarily on its own initiative and with its own resources. The Guild registered new titles and old printing blocks, adjudicated ownership disputes, and even operated a private police force to punish those who pirated its members' books. While the Chinese central state and its laws existed more in name than reality, the Guild, a private trade organization with no legitimate jurisdiction or official authorization actually regulated and protected copyright. The Guild's qualified success highlights the key role of trade organizations not only in commerce and law, but also in the fabric of social life of China prior to 1949. The illuminating case of the Shanghai Booksellers' Guild's enforcement of copyright thus offers insights into the history of copyright protection in China, but also compels us to reconsider conventional presumptions about the effectiveness of the late Qing and the Republican states within their own core territories. This dissertation shows that the absence of an evenly effective state does not mean that aspects of social and economic life necessarily would fall into total chaos. Non-governmental actors could create some level of order and predictability within a larger, seemingly fractured or even anarchic public space while successfully manipulated the weak state to further their specific interests.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,History,History,"History, Law, Intellectual Property, Modern history, China, Copyright, Guild, Piracy, Publishing industry, Shanghai",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

However, it happened after China resumed its sovereignty over Hong Kong in July 1997. Using post-colonial Hong Kong as a cases study, this dissertation examines why and how legal mobilization can arise under authoritarianism. Adopting historical institutionalism as the analytical framework, I argue that the process of the sovereignty transition produced a critical juncture during which a new legal opportunity structure was created and the legislature was weakened. On the one hand, the implementation of the Bill of Rights and the Basic Law together with the establishment of a final appellant court located in Hong Kong, created new legal opportunities for individuals to use the law to advance their interests. On the other hand, Beijing and the Tung Chee-hwa administration tightened the political opportunities available to pro-democracy politicians and civil society, by weakening the legislature and marginalizing their political influence in the legislature. This shift of political opportunities from the legislature to the judicial branch, combined with the historical legacies of a legal complex (consists of an independent and competent judiciary, an autonomous and organized legal profession, and government-funded legal aid), and the agency of liberal cause lawyers and rights advocacy groups, contributed to the rise of legal mobilization in post-colonial Hong Kong. My dissertation makes three contributions. First, it engages and contributes to the emerging literature on judicial politics under authoritarianism by arguing that historical legacies play an important role in the rise of legal mobilization and that legal mobilization in authoritarian regimes by no means unfolds as political authorities would wish. Second, it highlights the impact of different forms of authoritarianism on the mode of opposition mobilization. Third, through studying how liberal cause lawyers in Hong Kong used their expertise and networks to promote democratic changes and the difficulty they encountered, my dissertation informs the literature on the relationship between economic modernization and democratization, especially the role of the middle class.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, Law, Political science, Authoritarianism, China, Democratization, Hong Kong, Judicial politics, Law and society, Legal mobilization",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

I argue that conversions are highly complex cultural interactions and must be seen as social processes that assemble diverse modes of knowledge, transform them, and then recirculate them back into society. Converts need to be seen, not as passive absorbers of another faith, but as faithful agents actively reforming the social world around them. Thus, in China during this period, Christian converts sculpted identities that simultaneously reflected and amended both Chinese and Christian values, and sought to create communities within a nexus between Chinese popular religions and western Christianities without being reduced to either. Through the processes of conversion novel idioms of individual and communal identity emerged that, while never uncontested, reverberated throughout the larger world. In many respects, my dissertation revisits some questions raised by earlier intellectual histories of the Great Encounter between China and the West. However, by focusing on Chinese converts themselves rather than on the material successes or failures of western missions I seek to reassess how religious identities function and resonate in a modern China. In short, this is a work about the rupture and resurrection of communities, about the blending of traditions, and about the reinforcement of boundaries. It is about attempts to translate the novel into the extraordinary, and render the mundane uncanny. It is about individuals trying to make sense of lives that had become fragmented and unmoored. It is about communities (families, villages, churches) trying to maintain cultural norms and assert communal cohesion in the face of unprecedented (though not always unwelcome) external intrusion. It is a meditation about conversion, and about continuity. It is a series of descriptions of some of the many attempts made by Chinese Christians to come to grips with the changes and challenges of entering the twentieth century.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"History, Religious history, China, Christianity, Conversion, Religious experience",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

1837430762,"Zhang, Yang","Insurgent dynamics: The coming of the Chinese rebellions, 1850-1873",Contemporary,"My dissertation offers a dynamic, relational explanation of the emergence of mid-19th century rebellions in the Qing Empire of China—the bloodiest insurgent civil war in human history. This turbulent era witnessed the formation of widespread and protracted uprisings, including not only the landmark Christian-inspired Taiping Rebellion but also a conjunction of sectarian, ethnic, and religious revolts. Theoretically, my thesis moves beyond the structural, eventful, and endogenous models, and further develops the dynamic model that has been emerging in the field of contentious politics and historical sociology. I employ multiple methods—including subnational and sequential comparison—to analyze a large volume of primary sources such as internal government communications, diaries of officials, records of rebels, memoirs of missionaries, and local sources. My dissertation makes a central theoretical contention: that revolutions and rebellions usually emerge from processual interactions among multiple organizational actors rather than being determined by pre-existing structural conditions or static, categorical identities (i.e., class, religious, or ethnic identities). This contention contains three interrelated claims: first, insurgent actions and events are often produced in reaction to the revolutionary process rather than preexisting structures. second, the emergence of rebellions is the result of dynamic interactions among relational actors. third, the unfolding of rebellions is thus sensitive to temporalities, albeit in patterned ways. By elaborating these claims, my dissertation makes distinctive contributions to the understanding of the origins and processes of large-scale movements. In the empirical analysis, I focus on a few critical episodes during this rebellious wave, including: the abrupt transformation of the Taiping movement from an indigenous Christian society to a revolution, the divergence of initially defensive elite militias into rebels and repressors, the crystallization of Muslim mobilization in distinct directions across three regions, and the frequent defection from and division of originally coherent coalitions. Structural conditions and pre-existing identities offer a limited explanation of these phenomena. Instead, rebellious mobilization and development often unfolded as short-term, unintended outcomes of iterative interactions among key actors—including central and local state actors, militia commanders, communal elites, and religious leaders—who often employed emerging organizational frameworks to respond to their local rivals, competitors, and patrons in changing situations. In a nutshell, by uncovering underlying mechanisms from complicated historical processes, the dynamic, relational model proves crucial to the unpacking of puzzles about the emergence, transformations, and divergence of these consequential movements.",2016,2016,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,Sociology,Sociology,"History, Sociology, China, Contentious politics, Dynamic, Qing empire, Rebellion, Relational model, Religion and ethnicity",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

This study is concerned with the role that awareness of the Chinese polity played in Islamic political thought. Muslim polities', and especially the Ottomans', turn to more centralized political structure that would become typical of Early Modern absolutist empires over the course of the 16 th century, was anticipated a century and a half earlier by the rise of the Ming dynasty in China. And yet, little has been written about how the Chinese polity was perceived and represented in the Muslim world during the Ming period, or even about representations of China in Islamicate culture, more generally. This study turns to the Khatāynāmah or Book of China, a description of China written in 922/1516 for the Ottoman Emperor, Selim I, by Sayyid 'Alī Akbar Khatāyī, a merchant from Transoxiana who had traveled to Beijing during the Zhengde reign (1505-1521), for evidence of how the Ming state was perceived in western Eurasia, and the role these perceptions may have played in the turn towards bureaucratization and centralization in the Ottoman Empire. The most substantial text on China in any west Eurasian language before the late 16 th century, the Khatāynamah addressed the Ottoman court as well as a larger urban, Muslim public, and argued for a turn towards more centralized, bureaucratic governance and the complete regulation of the polity by an artificial law and system. The depiction of Chinese bureaucracy and the relationship between codified law, legal tradition, custom, and policy presciently anticipates, and may have served as a model for, the expansion of the bureaucracy and codification of law that occurred in the reign of Selim's successor, Süleyman the Lawgiver. As a text that concerns both a specific non-Muslim polity, and general themes such as empire, political centralization, bureaucracy, and the nature of crafts, trades, and technology, which were of interest in Islamicate political and imaginative literature in the 15 th and 16 th centuries, it can also serve as evidence of how improved firearms and other technological developments, occurring within western Eurasia, were perceived. Although it is never possible to determine the exact cultural and political legacy of any single book, the Khatāynāmah was not the only channel through which Central Asian Muslims, and even the Ottoman court, learned about China. In addition to constituting an important episode in the history of contact between China and western Eurasia, it tells us about what other travelers are likely to have said, and provides a window onto the larger processes of communication underlying hemisphere-wide political trends that culminated in, or were foreclosed by, the modern world order.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations,Near Eastern and Judaic Studies,"History, World History, Islamic Studies, Central asia, China, Chinese bureaucracy, Early modern absolutis empires, Ottoman, Travel",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

The conventional wisdom held by many realists is that during the early Cold War period, the U.S. should have formed an alliance with China against the stronger Soviet power in Asia as it did in 1972. However, they argue, the U.S. had irrationally pursued a confrontational policy toward China due to domestic political pressures until the 1960s. In my dissertation, I present a structural explanation that counters the domestic explanation. From late 1949, in the face of strong domestic pressures, the Truman administration persistently pursued a policy to form an alliance with China to improve the U.S. position in the bipolar competition. However, this policy was not feasible for structural reasons. In global balance and especially in Asia, the U.S. maintained its superiority in bipolarity on the basis of its greater strategic and economic capabilities. In these circumstances, China was forced to ally with the Soviet Union to balance the stronger U.S. power. During the 1950s, China kept balancing the stronger U.S. with its Soviet ally. And the Eisenhower administration pursued a tough containment to reduce the relative power growth of China. This inimical relations was maintained in the 1960s as China continued to balance the stronger U.S. In 1972, an alliance between the U.S. and China was formed. By the late 1960s, the Soviet Union upset the regional balance by building up its conventional and nuclear forces in Asia while reaching parity with the U.S. in global balance. This structural change compelled China to seek an ally to balance the stronger Soviet power in Asia. As a consequence, the U.S. and China formed an alliance to check the Soviet dominance in Asia in spite of strong political and ideological constraints. Thus my study finds that the alliance relationships between the U.S. and China before and after 1972 are explained by power structures. Theoretically, these hard cases vindicate the balance of power theory by showing how powerfully the distributions of capabilities shape the alliance choices and their outcomes under anarchy.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"International law, International relations, History, Alliance, China, Cold War, United States-China",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

Eschewing a dichotomy of state and market, the dissertation echos Borocz's call for an historical mosaic typology of the modes of economic integration. Finally, the dissertation reformulates the notion of householding—a neglected mode of economic integration—examines how it interweaves with the redistributive sector and the market sector in transforming the lives of Chinese working class. By taking an historical institutional approach, the dissertation argues that the works of Szelenyi, Burawoy, Walder and Stark over-emphasize labor-management bargaining in the state redistributive sector because they ignore the historical and institutional variations of state socialisms. This study remedies their analyses by examining how labor management bargaining was transformed by changing institutional designs, design failures and subsequent institutional bricolages into enterprise-household bargaining over time. This study examines the shifting balance in bargains between enterprise and households through the politics of bureaucratization and informalization. On the one side, enterprises wavered between bureaucratized and informalized provision strategies in an attempt to accommodate enterprise burdens and flagging workers' incentives. On the other side, households fluctuated between relying on enterprise provisions and their own methods of coping with shortfalls of enterprise provisions. The mixture of multiple provisioning strategies and multiple livelihood strategies thus provides a historical grounded mosaic typology of modes of economic integration on which an institutionalist approach of inequalities can be developed. Through a case study of South Wind, a state enterprise in China, the dissertation examines state policies, management documents, and oral histories of working class households. The dissertation shows how plans initiated by state elites went awry, and enterprise and working class households improvised in bargaining to cope with problems in production and livelihood over three historical periods: proto-socialist industrialization, chaotic industrialization and marketization. Inequalities across and within working class households interwove with changing inequalities of the redistributive sector and the market sector, which generate a more complex pattern of social inequalities over time.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Labor relations, Social structure, History, Bureaucratization, China, Informalization, Socialist, South Wind, Working class",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

The creation of a people's nation would have social, political, and historical ramifications that continue to influence the perception of the relationship between the Chinese citizenry and the state. This study analyzes the body of culture known as people's literature to show how earlier conceptions of the popular informed the production of a literature and culture of the people. After an exploration of the use of the term people I show how both pre-modern and Republican literary and cultural traditions---including rural culture, middle-brow popular fiction, and modern mass culture---influence and were re-conceptualized in the composition of people's literature. The intersection of traditional culture and revolutionary narratives, and the implications for the representation of gender and class formed by their mutual influence, comprises a main object of analysis. The merging of pre-revolutionary literary traditions and ideological themes such as women's liberation often results in dynamic works of literature, and it is a goal of this study to provide a new appreciation of these complex texts that can seem so simple upon cursory perusal. People's literature is a vibrant body of culture. While it is true that it remained under careful state control, it is characterized by formal experimentation, a dual focus on education and entertainment, and an exploration of new roles for both male and female citizens of new China. Authors, artists, and filmmakers brought a passion to their work that derived from their belief that they were developing not only a new literature, but actually molding a new Chinese citizenry.

The production of Chinese silent and early sound film and its reception registered profound changes in everyday life, in the way the world was perceived, and in knowledge production and dissemination in early 20th-century China. I delineate the constitution and transformation of a film culture, including aspects of production, exhibition and other related cultural practices, centered in the emerging cosmopolitan setting of Shanghai. I examine, on a general and theoretical level, the complex ties between the early cinema and the vernacular movement, as well as the interaction between verbal and visual culture within the broader scenario of democratization of writing and iconography. I discuss how new gender relations and perceptions of the body are configured, both on and off the screen, in a modernizing urban space under the impact of mass media and commodity culture. Engaging previously unstudied material, I focus on a number of significant topoi in the landscape of film and vernacular culture and their articulations in selected films. I consider the interrelation between the expansion of a “film world” and the transition to a narratively integrated cinema, the rise of the script as a new form of writing informed by new technology, the boom of and the subsequent suppression through censorship of the “martial arts-magic spirit” film, as well as the advent of sound and its implications for an “aesthetic of emergency” in the midst of a national crisis. Bracketing the importance of language and the printed and spoken word as discussed in previous scholarship on the relationship between the vernacular movement and cultural modernity, I argue that early Chinese cinema constitutes a mass-mediated phenomenological experience and an inclusive vernacular modernity. As a historical as well as aesthetic formation, the multifaceted film culture contributed in important ways to the production of a socio-physiological sensorium that is at once culturally specific and globally oriented. The experience of Chinese modernity cannot be adequately understood outside this vernacular film culture.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Motion Pictures, Asian literature, History, China, Film culture, Urban modernity, Vernacular experience",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

The title “Representing China Musically” refers to their effort. This subject arose out of my response to the previous scholarship on the high-profile National Conservatory of Music founded in Shanghai in 1927. For many years the National Conservatory of Music has been a major focal point in historical studies of twentieth-century Chinese music. It has been both praised and criticized by music scholars of different backgrounds and intellectual interests. Yet, thus far a systematic study of the conservatory is still wanting. Besides an introduction, the three chapters and an epilogue comprise four studies, focusing on four aspects of China's musical modernity during the period of 1900–1937: the promulgation of the Chinese national anthem, the implementation of general music education, the beginning of higher music education, and the invention of Chinese identity in early Chinese sound films. Linking the four studies is the National Conservatory of Music's endeavor to reform Chinese music. In addressing the role of the National Conservatory of Music in relation to these four aspects of early twentieth-century China's musical modernity, this study is responding to four contrasting perspectives taken by scholars in the previous discussions. The perspectives are (1)&#xa0.the Chinese Nationalist Party, which emphasizes the conservatory's national status. (2)&#xa0.the Chinese Communist Party, which deemphasizes the conservatory's national status. (3)&#xa0.the music scholars who are interested in the conservatory's success in promoting Western-style Chinese music and (4)&#xa0.the cultural scholars and ethnomusicologists who concern themselves with how the conservatory tradition has altered China's indigenous musical landscapes in irreversible ways.

Theoretically it asks why many colonies came to be imagined as nations by the natives. Empirically it explains why a Taiwanese nationalism, instead of a Chinese nationalism, emerged in Taiwan under the Japanese colonial rule in the 1920s. I review two theories of colonial nationalism, Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities and Partha Chatterjee's Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World , and find them suffer from structural incompleteness and empirical difficulties, which can be attributed to a bias that reduces colonialism to a European model and neglects Japan's oriental colonialism. I revise these two theories to accommodate Japanese colonialism and combine them into one Anderson-Chatterjee thesis. The Anderson-Chatterjee thesis understands colonial nationalism as arising from actions of the colonized to critique and interpret an exclusively structured colonial space. Along this line, I argue that Taiwanese began to imagine Taiwan as nation as a result of the exclusion of Japan's oriental colonialism, and this nascent national imagining was developed into a full-fledged nationalist ideology by the Taiwanese through their struggle against the oriental colonialism. I first re-conceptualize Japanese formal empire as an expanding nation-state and argue that Japanese colonialism in Taiwan, Korea and Katafuto was a nationalizing colonialism aiming at incorporating these peripheries through a system of differential incorporation, which placed the peripheries in a state of institutional liminality and imposed on them a condition of double marginality. Next I show how the state of institutional liminality turned the colonial space of Taiwan into a national space in the minds of Taiwanese, who began to develop discourses of political nationalism out of contentions with the Japanese state in the 1910s and 1920s. Along their fight against Japan's assimilationism in the 1920s and 1930s, they also articulated a cultural nationalism. Both politically and culturally, the condition of double marginality compelled the Taiwanese to choose a pro-West and modernist ideological strategy to construct their national imagination.

Yet, in its revolutionary project, the CCP did not want simply to consolidate power, it wanted to form subjects loyal to the state alone. In achieving such deep state penetration, the CCP brought to heel all groups that stood in its way. One such group deemed counterrevolutionary was the Shanghai Catholic community. The CCP were threatened by the independent organizational capacity of the Catholic Church. Catholics, for their part, were fighting for their very survival. Time would show that the CCP wanted nothing less than to dismantle the Catholic Church in Shanghai and replace it with a puppet church which answered only to the atheistic regime. Even despite mounting state pressure, the Shanghai Catholic Church resisted the CCP for over six years. How were they able to succeed where so many other groups failed? It is my contention that the Catholic community in Shanghai was able to mount a protracted and powerful campaign of resistance to encroaching Communist power because it had a unifying belief system, a strong leadership, and a well-articulated organization . Why Catholics resisted can be explained by Catholic belief. How Catholics resisted can be answered by Catholic leadership and organization. First, the Catholic community in Shanghai had a formidable leader in Bishop Kung (Gong) Pinmei. Kung valiantly resisted CCP to head an Independent Catholic Church, a contradiction in terms. The second key to Catholic success was a well-articulated organization. For Catholic leaders mobilized the laity, especially the youth. The resulting Catholic Youth organization drew from lay movements such as the Legion of Mary and the Jesuit-inspired Marian Sodalities. The Catholic Youth ensured that the faith would be passed on should the priests be arrested. Even according to secret internal CCP documents, Jesuit priests and the Catholic Youth formed the backbone of resistance to the Shanghai CCP.

These worshipping images are an important source for the study of both the devotional practices of contemporary Buddhism and the social significance of Buddhist art patronage in the Northern Dynasties. This was a period in which the conquest of Northern China by non-Chinese regimes led to the destabilization of some traditional Chinese social structures and the introduction of non-Chinese customs and practices. Because of this, various forms of social identity such as class, ethnicity, family status, and gender were renegotiated in Northern China during this period of political division. This series of case studies of individual Buddhist art patrons focuses on the ways in which the patrons' identity is represented in worshipper figures as compared to other biographical sources of the time, in order to understand the ways in which the patrons represented themselves in a public religious context. Lady Yuchi, the wife of a Xianbei elder statesman, used the images of herself and her husband and son in a niche she dedicated in 495 to give herself primacy within a nuclear family of sorts, despite the fact that she was actually subordinate in status to her husband's primary wife. The cave temple of Gaomiaoshan functioned as a representation of the collective fortunes of its patrons, the Chen family, during the Eastern Wei, and of the complex relationships of seniority within the extended family. Zhang Yuanfei, the patron of the Shuiyusi cave temple, chose to appear as a nearly anonymous member of a group of patrons in one context and as an individual patron in another context within the same site. And the imperial patron of the Binyang Central Cave chose to be represented in the cave not by his own image, but by the image of his father, in whose honor the cave was dedicated.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Art history, Art patronage, Buddhist, China, Sculpture, Social dimensions",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304406766,"Hong, Jeehee",Theatricalizing death in performance images of mid -imperial China,Modern,"This dissertation explores the meanings and functions of images that represent theatrical performances formulated within mortuary contexts in mid-imperial China. Focusing on the relationship between these representations and theatrical experiences of the contemporary living, I examine the ways in which a specific self-reflexivity generated through the images of performances in theatrical terms reveal contemporary views and attitudes towards death and the netherworld. This period of time, ranging roughly from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, witnesses a vibrant emergence and development of representations of theatrical performance situated in tomb space. In media as diverse as brick reliefs, clay figurines, engraving on the surfaces of sarcophagi and paintings, such images came increasingly to occupy tomb space over these three centuries. Although the emergence of these dynamic expressions of theatrical performance does correspond to the development of drama during this time, I argue that the meanings of these representations go considerably beyond simple reflections of actual performance culture. Each chapter showcases one or two images of theatrical performances in various media, and discusses how their particular materiality and visual effects are in dialogue with the space which contained them. The diversity in media and visual effects revealed in each example speaks not only to increasingly deeper connotations of theatrical images in mortuary contexts, which signals their divorce from traditional depictions of entertaining performances, but further helps us locate a particular visual logic shared by the images. By grasping the complex nature of actual theatrical performances in the realm of the living and contemporaries' theatrical experience as the prototypical imageries of their representations, I extract a particular self-reflexivity conveyed by the performance images. Rather than simply illustrating a performance tableau, these images function as a site in which the notions of life and death are contested through the theatrical vision. I argue that the theatrical vision, by staging worlds for both the living and the dead, served for the contemporaries to configure themselves as audience members of the symbolic performance of death and life, as well as to socialize death as an enactment of their various and varied lives.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Art history, China, Death, Early Chinese theater, Performance image, Religiosity in medieval China, Theatricality, Tomb (Medieval Chinese), Tomb space",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

Focusing on this popular religion’s active involvement in public affairs from 1920 to 1954, mostly in Shandong province, it explores how this religious organization developed its networks and businesses, as well as how its syncretic belief shaped its unique religious identity. It also examines the complex relationship between religious charity and the state in modern China. Religious charity in this project focuses on charitable works by the popular religion. One of the purposes of this research is to view local popular religions as influential social actors. It also creates a vehicle for exploring the ways various charitable works by these groups served as a critical node in which religious and secular forces overlapped. Few historians mention the role of religion in the social formation of modern China. This study aims to contribute to the scholarly discussion on religion-state relations in the modern Chinese context. It is, however, neither another simple reiterated critique of secularization theory, nor a grandiose theorization of Chinese religiosities. Instead, it presents the informal religious sector as an alternative within the socio-historical context of modern China.

It investigates how the debates concerning death rituals and the actual practice of those rituals introduced new social dynamics into the process of state formation, and how those rituals reflected the varied visions of society held by different groups. I argue that death rituals functioned as a stage on which practitioners not only revealed their imaginings of the world beyond and their positions within that imaginary world, but also located themselves within the hierarchical relations of the contemporary social world. Emperors used newly invented Daoist death rituals to maximize royal authority by enacting a newly invented dynastic myth of the royal family's divine origins. A major line of Confucian scholar-officials employed institutional measures to revive the ancient Confucian rituals as a way of checking power of emperors and wealthy merchants who freely practiced non-Confucian death rituals. By contrast, rich merchants and commoners often used unsanctioned death rituals—primarily Buddhist and Daoist rituals--as a way of resisting a state authority undergirded by Confucian values. I maintain that these ritual disputes helped Confucian officials gain more political power and fostered the rise of neo-Confucianism.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, China, Confucianism, Daoism, Death rituals, Imagination, Northern Song dynasty, Ritual, The Song dynasty",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

Jiang hoped that achieving the goals of the movement, which in large part included reforming manners and habits of daily living, would “save the nation”from the various threats and challenges it faced. The foundation of the movement was Confucianism, and the cardinal virtues of li (propriety), yi (righteousness), lian (discerning right from wrong) and chi (a sense of shame), were the structure within which the movement's goals were articulated, and reflected the effort of the Nationalists (Guomindang) to reclaim Confucianism as an essential part of Chinese heritage. In addition to these and other overt references to Confucianism, the New Life Movement reflects fundamental aspects of political Confucianism in both policy and implementation, and demonstrates the inseparability of the political with other aspects of religion in Confucian religiosity. This is seen especially in the official directives to insure public morality and to control education, and in the effort to direct and control daily personal habits, an important part of the foundational Li Ji (Record of Rites) and echoed in myriad statutes through imperial age. Jiang and the Guomindang exhibit this mode of Confucianism, where state authority extends to dictating the details of even personal habits in order to effect transformations of the body and morality which will better society, an example of the subordination of the individual to the community, even in the context of self transformation and self improvement. In addition to considering the New Life Movement, this dissertation challenges the tendency of studies of Confucian religiosity to focus on individual experience and self-transformation at the expense of the politically motivated and implemented forms of Confucianism, thus characterizing the side of Confucian religiosity which is authoritarian.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, China, Confucianism, Moral formation, New Life Movement, State authority, Taiwan",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States
304548034,"Hsia, Florence Charlotte","French Jesuits and the mission to China: Science, religion, history",Contemporary,"A forum for experiments in science and apostolic ministry, the Jesuit mission in China encompassed several distinct approaches to constructing Jesuit commitments to natural philosophy and the mathematical sciences, to construing their apostolic efficacy, and to justifying the propriety of activities associated with these commitments. The first part of the dissertation is devoted to an examination of just such an experiment as it was instantiated in the French Jesuit mission to China. I try to make sense of both the plausibility and the novelty of a group of French Jesuits, sent by Louis XIV to China as mathematiciens du roi an members of the Paris Académie des Sciences. I address the question of how this particular combination of scientific and religious objectives was viewed by critics of the Jesuits and by the Jesuits themselves. I then examine the declining fortunes of the French Jesuit “Académie de la Chine” and the dissolution of a laboriously constructed alliance between the Compagnie de Jésus and the Académie des Sciences. Jesuits in China were also eager witnesses to Chinese language, dress, customs, laws, government, religions, daily life, Chinese philosophy, cosmology, astronomy, medicine, natural history and botany. In the latter part of the dissertation, I pursue the intertwined strands of scientific and humanist concerns into the Enlightenment, focusing on the ‘historical turn’ taken by French Jesuits in China towards the indigenous tradition of natural knowledge. I remap the tortuous terrain of European learned approaches to the subject of Chinese astronomy, focusing in particular on the work of the French Jesuit Antoine Gaubil during his more than 30 years on the China mission. The historical research he and his interlocutors carried out reveals a collaborative process whereby shared intellectual habits, rooted in the tradition of technical chronology, made possible an increasingly rich cultural history of the origins and progress of the sciences.

305098916,"Li, Meng",Russian émigré literature in China: A missing link,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the cultural life of Russian émigrés in Harbin and Shanghai, the two Chinese cities where most Russians who fled Russia to the Far East after the October Revolution settled, and focuses on two most outstanding authors, Arsenii Nesmelov (1889–1945) and Valerii Pereleshin (1913–1992). It includes four chapters. Chapter One provides the historical and cultural background of the Russian emigration in China. Harbin, a “Russian” city with its colonial history, accepted a large portion of refugees. and the Chinese Eastern Railway built by Russians in Chinese territory provided the refugees opportunities to work. It was under these conditions that Russian émigré literature in China developed. To understand this will help us understand its uniqueness and its relationship with its counterpart in Europe. Chapter Two provides a general picture of the development of Russian émigré literature in Harbin and Shanghai, focusing on three generations of representative poets and prose writers and periodicals and books related to literature. It also accounts for social, historical, cultural, and literary reasons for the efflorescence of Russian émigré literature in China. The subject of Chapter Three is Nesmelov, the most famous Russian poet in Harbin. Most of his poetic heritage has been reprinted, thus his value as an important poet in the history of twentieth-century Russian literature has been recognized. This chapter concentrates on his biography and his prose works, most of which has not been reprinted. The discovery of his forgotten short stories brings to light his prose heritage that is unique for its themes, including the First World War and the Russian Civil War from a White perspective. Chapter Four strives to clarify many vague points, especially some commonly accepted explanations, in Pereleshin's biography and poetry, in order to determine his real relationship with his first homeland, Russia, and his second homeland, China. It analyzes the real reasons behind his contradictory attitudes toward Christianity and earthly pleasure, and, subsequently, interprets his poems from a biographical and psychological point of view.

304248560,"Han, Suk-Jung","Puppet sovereignty: The state effect of Manchukuo, from 1932 to 1936",Contemporary,"Manchukuo was a puppet state which claimed, eventually to be a 'sovereign' state. Manchukuo was created in 1932 in Manchuria, the northeastern region of China, by the Kwantung Army (the Japanese garrison army stationed there) after the army had waged a war against the Chinese warlord regime and expelled it (the Mukden Incident). My project is the history of Manchukuo in its early period (between its foundation and the Sino-Japanese War), focusing on the process of constructing a colonial state and exploring its sovereign state effect. My general question is why the colonial state became autonomous and how. The colonial state is fundamentally a rule of difference, representing the 'other' as inferior. In both the European and Japanese colonial experiences, the others were seen only as objects, not as subjects by alien rulers. The period of early Manchukuo, however, was different. People were called guomin (citizens) and warmly cared for even as the Japanese waged several undeclared wars against the KMT in North China in early thirties. The Japanese leaders of the government were very hegemonic and allotted a significant share of positions in the bureaucracy and business to the indigenous people. The colonial state became an impartial arbiter between its 'citizens' (Chinese) and 'foreigners' (Japanese settlers) and sometimes restrained the interest of the latter. The colonial state also took great pains in regards to the invention of tradition. The early Manchukuo project suggests that there are different periodizations for colonial states with their own rhythms and that even a colonial state has a productive concern on its subjects (called colonial governmentality), and that a colonial state also has peculiarities which modern states have developed, namely disciplinary power and a distinct method to appear to exist.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Chicago,NA,NA,"Social structure, History, China",65,Chicago,Illinois,41.8375,-87.6866,United States

This meant that the liberal journalists had to adapt to a new political and journalistic environment. How was this journalism formed? How did it operate? Was the traditional Chinese style of journalism thoroughly eradicated? Did the relationship between the newspeople and the political powers change completely? This dissertation consists of four parts. The first part explores the relationship between the newspeople and political power holders in China, and the development of CCP journalism before 1949. In the second part, I discuss how CCP journalism developed and operated under the influence of Soviet journalism. The third part is an examination of how non-Party journalism was transformed and utilized by the Party, and the newspeople’s experience under the Communist regime in the 1950s. The last part describes how the Party converted its newspapers and the entire country into news-theaters in which the news and even the layout of the newspapers were ritualized and people had to behave according to what they learned from the newspapers. This dissertation suggests that although journalism in China underwent dramatic changes after 1949, many aspects lasted, especially the relationship between the newspeople and political power holders in China. I argue that the new journalism was characterized by its close connection with the Party organization. Benefiting from this connection, the Party newspapers were able to operate and bring the Party’s messages to the grassroots effectively, even though this connection also indicated that the newspapers were strictly supervised by Party authorities. By contrast, the internal bulletin system, a significant part of the Party’s journalism, was established to bring what was happening in the country to the leadership, but in many cases, it could not perform the tasks it was intended to. Finally, the Party’s journalism transformed the country into a news-theater in which individuals had to show their support for the Party publicly, so everyone simultaneously became an actor and an audience member.

304788692,"Yuan, Lijun",Reconceiving women's equality in China: A critical examination of models of sex equality,Contemporary,"The subordination of Chinese women continued under different models of sex equality in China in twentieth century. I will discuss and assess four models of women's equality: first, the traditional Confucian view of women which advocates that women's role is to follow and support men. second, the liberal feminist idea of formal equality for women introduced into China at the beginning of the twentieth century, which is anti-Confucianism and advocates women's equal rights in education, law, and employment. third, Mao's view of women's equality in production, calling for substantive equality between men and women. finally, the idea of equal opportunity in the economic transformation in the post-Mao period, the revival of Confucianism in this period and its convergence with the declining status of women. Each of these models has a variety of problems in dealing with women's equality, which I will discuss in the following chapters. However, I see one common thread running through all of them, namely, lack of emphasis on empowering women to develop their own visions of equality. Ideologies imposed from the top-down have rationalized the continuing subordination and exploitation of women, either blatantly (Confucianism) or more subtly (Maoism). After exposing the common feature in their failure to reach the social ideal of women's equality, I will propose a more democratic conception of women's equality that will allow ideals to continue changing as material circumstances change in different stages of social development.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of Colorado,NA,NA,"Philosophy, Womens studies, History, Social research, China, Equality, Feminism, Gender equality, Women's equality",2,Boulder,Colorado,40.0248,-105.2524,United States

During the rule of the Ch'ing Dynasty (1683-1895), Taiwan remained largely a remote, undeveloped frontier. The Taiwanese social, economic, linguistic, cultural and political institutions differed from those of China. Similarly unique was the development of the Taiwanese systems of education and of the imperial civil service examinations. Although extensive studies have been devoted to Chinese education and the imperial examination system, little scholarly attention has been given to the evolution of the education system in Taiwan. This study employs a cultural dependency theory in cultural colonialism as the theoretical framework for the study. The research utilizes a wide variety of original, primary and secondary sources available in Taiwan to explore the aims and administration of education, the schooling, and the imperial examination system in Taiwan during the Ch'ing Dynasty. The focus of this study is on providing an historical analysis of the development of educational thought and practice in Taiwan during the Ch'ing Dynasty. After presenting the background of education in Taiwan during the Ch'ing Dynasty, the study examines and provides answers to the following specific research questions: (1) How did the administration of education function? (2) How did the formal system of schooling function? (3) How did the imperial civil service examination system function? (4) What are the criteria of an educationally or culturally colonialist situation needed to evaluate an educational system in Taiwan? (5) Was the educational situation in Taiwan during the Ch'ing Dynasty one kind of cultural colonialism? The study concludes by arguing that Taiwanese education under the Ch'ing was, in a number of significant ways, partially colonialist in nature. However, it is further argued that it was the examination system, rather than the system of education, that was in some measure colonialist. The colonialist imperial examination system pervaded China, and was not limited to Taiwan. Colonialism, as was implemented through the examination process, was unconscious, in that none intended to colonize Taiwan and none questioned the justice of the system of education in Taiwan during the Ch'ing Dynasty.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Connecticut,NA,NA,"Education history, Educational theory, History, China",1,Storrs,Connecticut,41.8083,-72.2514,United States

In chapter one the historical setting for Sino-Lao relations is presented. The physical, social, and cultural geography of Laos and Indochina is discussed. Chapter one provides a context for Sino-Lao relations and their entanglement in the Cold War and triangular politics. Chapter two contains an examination and analysis of the theory and practice of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. The development of the Soviet concept of peaceful coexistence is examined and compared with the development of the five principles of peaceful coexistence as put forth by China and India at the Bandung Conference. In chapter three Sino-Lao relations between 1954 and 1964 are presented and placed in the context of Lao domestic politics and the triangular politics of the United States, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Chapter four continues the examination of Sino-Lao relations for the years 1964 through 1995. Again the Sino-Lao relationship is placed in the context of changing triangular politics, including Nixon's move away from Truman's containment policy. Chapter five contains a discussion and an analysis of the connection between the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the actual conduct of relations between the People's Republic of China and Laos. In chapter six there is a summary of the information presented and conclusions regarding the theory and practice of Sino-Lao relations. The five principles of peaceful coexistence may be used by two nations with good relations that are not interfering with other big power relationships, such as Sino-U.S. relations. In fact, the driving force behind the conduct of foreign relations seems to be national self-interest and power.

Research on the GPCR was carried out using primary and secondary documentary sources and interviews with Shenyang citizens. Research on the 1989 Movement involved direct observation, the collection of documents from the democracy walls, and conversations with participants. Several general arguments about social movements in the PRC are made: (1) In order to genuinely understand these movements, scholars must take into account the active participation of citizens in both movements, and must pay more attention to the political issues motivating the movement. and (2) PRC politics is a complex web of center and local politics, which together create the whole of national politics. Misunderstanding social movements infects explanations of the decline of communist systems, leading many to hail the decline of communism in the world through the emergence of civil society and to forecast the same fate for China, without realizing that the movements of the 1980s had their roots in earlier movements and may not signal a rise of a new civil society opposed to the state. Instead, the movements of the 1980s must be seen as part of a continuous thread of political debates occurring throughout the twentieth century in China. For example, participation in the twentieth century movements has influenced how citizens view politics: a shift in Chinese political culture altering the nature of the demands citizens make of their political system, and the methods used in translating political ideas into political activism. Although many of the issues debated in the two movements were the same, the 1989 Movement was not just a replay of the GPCR. Involvement in each movement introduced citizens to new ideas and to a new understanding of their role in politics. In the 1989 Movement, citizens were increasingly influenced by the new international language of human rights--just as earlier Chinese political thinkers and activists were influenced by ideas of democracy and political rights in the early part of the twentieth century.",1992,1992,Ph.D.,United States,University of Denver,NA,NA,"History, Political science, China, nineteen 1989 Movement",3,Denver,Colorado,39.762,-104.8758,United States

Yet, throughout her history, Hong Kong has experienced periodic waves of social movement activity. Why have social movements emerge? How do they act and create new avenues for political participation? These issues raise questions regarding Hong Kong's political structure and the post 1997 SAR government. This study focuses on the role social movements play in the political reform process. While most studies emphasize Great Britain's, China's and even the Hong Kong government's role, this study presents and analyzes the activities of social movements, so that a clearer picture of civil society and political change from below emerges. The study integrates the literature on Hong Kong, civil society and social movements into a multi-dimensional framework to analyze social movement influence in Hong Kong politics. The study's three case studies: the independent labor, the nontraditional Christian Church, and the democracy movements are analyzed using the multidimensional framework. The study evaluates the forces that drive and sustain social movements, such as, the issues, constituency, movement organization and structure. It analyzes the timing of protest and collective actions, asserting that social movements take advantage of policy and regime change to act. The study makes a contribution to the understanding of the relationship between grassroots efforts and the development of civil society in bringing about an autonomous society. Moreover, the study advances the understanding of social movements and international politics in non-Western and developing societies. In sum, this study argues that while the Chinese and British governments dispute the pace of political reform, the Hong Kong people have been neglected in the process.

During this period, an unprecedented number of Americans, mostly soldiers, were in China mingling with the Chinese. The timing was bad. The China that they met was first in the abyss of war, then in the midst of postwar chaos. The Chinese whom they encountered were among the worst--the soldiers, the officers, the bureaucrats, the racketeers, the thieves, the beggars, the prostitutes and the scavengers. Against the backdrops of the time, the meeting of the two cultures became traumatic. In the ill-starred intercourse, intimacy only led to disappointment and revulsion. China could be different things to different Americans. To the China Hands, it was the moorings of their lifetime journey, a land worth fighting for and a story of which they were part. To Albert Wedemeyer, the China Theater Commander, and Patrick Hurley, the Ambassador to China, it was a base to build up American power and a ground for a promising political career. To George Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff and then the Presidential Envoy to China, it was a backwater in U.S. global strategy, an irritating source of international tensions, yet a country toward whose people he retained great respect and sympathy. The scenarios unfold the interaction of the Americans and Chinese in the struggles between peace and war, democracy and tyranny, life and decay.

People in all levels of life, from emperors, literati, and officials to peasants, eunuchs, and courtesans, participated in theatrical presentations. In circumstances like religious ceremonies, court rituals, social gatherings, and dinner parties, plays were routinely staged. Theatrical activities also provided aesthetical, psychological, sensual, or spiritual satisfaction to many spectators. The Ming dramaturgy was greatly improved through the collective efforts of many professionals and enthusiasts. All three theatre worlds during the Ming dynasty-- court theatre, private theatre, and public theatre, each generally separated one from the other--are covered in this dissertation. Some aspects, such as troupe organization, actor background, actor training, performance circumstance, and acting, are described for each of the three theatre milieus. Other aspects, such as singing, dancing, directing, costuming, lighting, music, props, scenery, and theatre buildings, are discussed only where sufficient data have been collected. As a result of eight years of effort, this study presents much original material heretofore unavailable to modern scholars.

304189198,"Hsiung, Hsien-kuan Ann-Marie",Seeking women in pre-modern Chinese texts: A feminist re-vision of Ming drama (1368-1644),Modern,"This study of Ming drama adopts feminist contextual criticism to argue against simplistic views of Chinese women as passive victims of traditional Confucian patriarchy. I treat Ming drama as a cultural production and discuss dramatically constructed women within their socio-historical contexts. Integrating insights from literary, historical and cultural studies, I present a dynamic vision of Chinese women that defies their usual stereotypes. While primarily focused on male dramatic representations of women, to incorporate women's self-perceptions, this study also looks at women playwrights and their surviving plays. I explore the intricate relationship between represented women and historical women, and argue against those feminist critics who view male literary writing about women as entirely fictions. Though male playwrights do often employ women as metaphors to boost male egos, echo dominant ideologies, convey philosophical ideals, and project male anxieties or fantasies, male representations demonstrably reflect and affect the lived experiences of women. While frustrated playwrights during the oppressive despotic early Ming era tended to emphasize women's submission and loyalty to men, anxious male playwrights in the culturally diverse late Ming period used women to express their Philosophical ideal of qing, or to reclaim male authority by repudiating strong-willed women. Such representations responded to shifting social-cultural forces and to real-life women, and, at different moments, perpetuated, accommodated or subverted the dominant ideology. This study shows that Confucian patriarchy was more porous and flexible than it has previously been made to appear. There was negotiable space for mothers and wives to maneuver for their own interests, for young women to assert their will in love and to take expedient measures to cross social boundaries, as well as for literate women to assume new roles as writers and readers. I conclude that Chinese women sought personal achievement when opportunities allowed. they frequently embodied androgynous characteristics, and were often distinguished by their strength, tenacity and intelligence--traits still evident in Chinese women today.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Hawaii at Manoa,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Womens studies, History, China",15,Honolulu,Hawaii,21.3294,-157.846,United States

305192814,"Fuqua, Douglas Sherwin","The Japanese missions to Tang China and maritime exchange in East Asia, 7th–9th centuries",Medieval,"Scholars offer three reasons why the Japanese dispatched envoys to Tang China to assimilate the advanced civilization, culture, and systems of Tang. to raise Japan's diplomatic position in the Tang Court while obtaining reports regarding changes in East Asian affairs. and finally, to conduct trade under the control of the state. I explore the third point in this dissertation. In particular, I seek to explain the role of the kentôshi with regard to a maritime trade network that developed in East Asia. I examine the voyages the kentôshi made, as well as the exchanges the missions conducted while in China. I begin with a study of the navigational challenges the Japanese faced and the ocean-going vessels they constructed. As a part of this, I survey Japan's maritime history, from evidence of the first water craft in Japan to the development of kôzôsen boats, or composite vessels. I next turn to the question of the trade itself. I categorize the exchange between Japan and the continent as “imperial,” “elite,” and “private.” Imperial trade refers to the tributary exchanges conducted by the envoys dispatched through official government channels in the names of the respective Courts. Elite trade, often concurrent with imperial trade, was conducted by the individual members of official diplomatic missions through government channels or under the jurisdiction of agencies such as the Diankeshu Office in Tang China and the Treasury Ministry and Palace Storehouse Bureau in Japan. Private trade, in contrast, was carried out by merchants. These merchants often traded with representatives of the government or representatives of the ruling classes. i.e., the wealthy and powerful elites. In this dissertation I also use archaeology to better understand trade with the continent. The most common vessels imported to Japan were white-glazed ceramics from Hebei Province, celadon from the kilns in Hunan Province, and Yue celadon produced primarily in Zhejiang. I believe trade was more important to the kentôshi than heretofore discussed in the English language literature. In the ninth century, merchant activity began to supercede the trading function of the official embassies, rendering them obsolete. This is true, not only of trade between Japan and Tang, but between Japan and Silla as well. This is not true, however, in the case of Bohai.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of Hawaii at Manoa,NA,NA,"History, Archaeology, Ancient civilizations, Asia, China, Japanese, Maritime exchange, Missions, Ninth century, Seventh century, Tang dynasty",15,Honolulu,Hawaii,21.3294,-157.846,United States

After a detailed examination of Cui Shu's background and biographical materials, this study explores the scholarly relationships of Cui Shu especially in the context of mid-Qing intellectual transformations. It then analyzes his historical skepticism and inquiry within the scope of Qing Learning, emphasizing their links with previous modes in Chinese historical thought. Cui Shu's work, this study concludes, offers far more than a body of empirical research--it provides a critical methodology for textual criticism and historical inquiry in Qing Learning. although in his case that methodology remains constrained by applying to all texts except the Five Classics. His work has philosophical and epistemological implications for the twentieth-century scholars that Cui Shu may not have grasped himself as discussed in this study. Finally, the thesis assesses the Cui Shu rediscovery. After the long neglect, Cui Shu's posthumous publications and surviving manuscripts were taken up during the May Fourth Cultural Movement by Chinese historians looking for indigenous anticipations of the new history. Cui Shu's work became the main, though not the only, source for twentieth-century reevaluations of ancient history. With the rise of the Critiques of Ancient History (Gushibian) in the 1920s, Hu Shi, Gu Jiegang and other intellectuals celebrated Cui Shu's thought as novel and groundbreaking. Cui Shu did anticipate issues important to modern Chinese historians. his doubting of antiquity and textual authentication in particular were appealing and powerful anticipations of modern standards of historical scholarship. However, his doubting has too frequently been appropriated uncritically and ahistorically by modern critics, who, because of their specific ideological agendas, neglect the crucial Confucian dimensions and delimitations of Cui Shu's thought. Thus this study also reconsiders and supplements Hu Shi and Gu Jiegang's pioneering work on Cui Shu by restoring a larger historical framework.

305008861,"Mudd, Scott E.","Graphic propaganda: Japan's creation of China in the prewar period, 1894–1937",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the role that Japanese graphic media played in the formation of Japanese attitudes towards China and Chinese during the prewar era from 1894–1937. Bracketed by the two Sino-Japanese Wars of 1894–1895 and 1937–1945, this period witnessed the formation of much of modern Japan's physical and cultural infrastructure. As such, studying the graphic imaging of China during these years will further increase our understanding of how Sino-Japanese relations deteriorated to such an extent, for such a long time, and so rapidly after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. In approaching this topic, I used three major research strategies. First, I analyzed quantitatively the commercially produced graphic material of China. For the years up until the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, this meant looking at hundreds of woodblock prints. for the rest of the period, I examined hundreds of photographs published in mass-market oriented graphic magazines. Second, I examined the development of Japan's modern infrastructure in conjunction with the technological evolution of its print-media industry. Finally, I looked at the relationship between the Japanese media and censorship. My overall rationale was to determine how the Japanese media graphically depicted Chinese, how widely this portrayal of China extended, and censorship's role in the imaging of China. I found that, in spite of extremely negative caricatures that characterized the portrayal of Chinese during the first Sino-Japanese War, Japan's graphic portrayal of Chinese appeared, on the surface, to improve over the following decades. However, Japan's media actually marginalized the accurate portrayal of contemporary Chinese reality over time. It created an image of a China dominated by Japanese, where Chinese were often literally “out of the picture” in photographs purportedly about China. When the media depicted Chinese, it usually was in terms of “good” or “bad,” with the good Chinese seeking Japan's aid in modernizing against the backward, bad Chinese. In contrast, Japanese in a Chinese context were portrayed in terms of courage, discipline, and loyalty. In addition to creating an image of cultural superiority, this dichotomy made it easier for the Japanese public to justify Japan's lengthy aggressive military presence in China.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of Hawaii at Manoa,NA,NA,"History, China, Graphic propaganda, Japan, Prewar period, Propaganda",15,Honolulu,Hawaii,21.3294,-157.846,United States

Within a few short weeks the rebels had captured nearly the whole of the Chinese settled portions of the island. Violent disturbances and communal strife were constant features of life on eighteenth century Taiwan. However, the scale and swiftness of the Lin Shuangwen rebels overwhelmed the Qing garrisons on Taiwan, necessitating the dispatch of tens of thousands of soldiers across the treacherous Taiwan Strait in order to maintain Qing control of its remaining strongholds along the western coast of Taiwan. Eventually, the Qing court was forced to organize a major expedition, drawing men and materiel from the vast reaches of the Qing empire. This expedition, under the legendary Manchu general Fukangan, crushed the rebellion in a series of brutal battles, restoring Qing rule of Taiwan. At the end of the reign of the Qianlong emperor (1735-1796), the campaign to suppress the Lin Shuangwen Rebellion was included on a list of what the emperor considered to be his Ten Great Campaigns. This dissertation analyzes the rebellion from a Qing military perspective. The early chapters focus on a discussion of the Qing military system in eighteenth century China. Then, after examining the background history of Taiwan and Qing officialdom's extensive experience dealing with violent disturbances by the Chinese settlers on the island, the bulk of the dissertation uses the Lin Shuangwen campaign as a case study for understanding major Qing military expeditions. In general, this portion of the dissertation follows a chronological discussion of the campaign. To the extent allowed by the sources, the major topics analyzed in this portion of the dissertation include command and control, planning, logistics, transport, strategy, tactics, and siegecraft.

Through a consideration of the complex interplay of ethnicity, violence and governance I argue that the rebellion was provoked largely by an escalation in anti-Hui violence perpetrated by Han Chinese rather than an inherent desire by the Muslim Yunnanese to rebel. Because of the prominent role that the Muslim Yunnanese played in the Panthay Rebellion, most studies have ignored the role of the Han and other ethnic groups involved in the earlier violence which had been occurring since the early part of the nineteenth century. The examination takes up the complex physical, ethnic and political context of the province as well as highlighting the subtle forms in which Islam had manifested itself in Yunnan. Early chapters highlight the variety of violent incidents which were typical in both their ethnic diversity and the balanced government's response. Chapter 4 then traces the sudden rise in anti-Hui attacks and the growing support of the government of these attacks culminating in the Kunming massacre of 1856. Chapters 5 and 6 conclude by delineating the complex paths that the rebellion took with specific attention to the divisions among the Muslim Yunnanese. By challenging the traditional interpretations and long standing assumptions of this rebellion, this study presents a more Yunnanese perspective on the local politics, multi-ethnic dimensions, and internal dynamics of the Muslim Yunnanese.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Hawaii at Manoa,NA,NA,"History, Cultural anthropology, China, Ethnic insurgency, Muslim, Panthay Rebellion, Rebellion, Yunnanese",15,Honolulu,Hawaii,21.3294,-157.846,United States

This dissertation focuses on the port-city of Guangzhou, located on the southeastern coast of China, which was the acknowledged prime destination for maritime trade for most of the Tang dynasty. The specific historical question of this work investigates the influence of international maritime trade on the growth and expansion of Guangzhou during the Tang dynasty. The main assertion of this study is that, during the period of the Tang dynasty, Guangzhou not only grew in urban form due to the flourishing economy, but also became a multivalent symbol—representing both the culture of the imperial center and also the local characteristics of its frontier location. Ultimately, this period in Guangzhou's history would create a space for the creation of a separate Cantonese identity within the larger narrative of a Han Chinese identity.

This dissertation focuses on that relationship during the turbulent 1920s and 1930s, an era defined by warlordism, nationalism, communism and Japanese aggression, when opium had penetrated all levels of Chinese society, economy and politics. Its most significant impact, however, was in the political arena. Warlord politics created and sustained the narcotics problem of that time by making opium taxation an indispensable source of revenue for local and national governments. The first part of this study examines the effects of opium on Chinese society and economy. It not only altered the minds and bodies of those who smoked the drug, but also changed the way people interacted with each other on social occasions. More importantly, as China's leading cash crop, the cultivation and trade in opium created a narco-economy that profoundly influenced the largely agricultural national economy. The second part of this study uses the Guomindang's opium policies as a window on the symbiotic relationship that evolved between the Republican narco-economy and warlord politics. Heretofore, there has been no systematic examination of Nationalist opium suppression efforts covering the years 1924 to 1937. By studying Guomindang opium policy, not only can one gain new perspectives on the processes of national unification and state-building, but also on the interaction between state and society over the contentious issue of prohibition versus legalization. How urban elites organized themselves to fight the opium scourge illuminates the dynamic nature of Chinese civil society during this chaotic period. This dissertation is primarily based on research in archival materials located in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, the overwhelming majority of which have never been cited in any previous works. American and British consular reports, and publications from contemporary anti-opium associations that have been overlooked in previous works were also consulted.

During that most tumultuous period in each Republic's short history, China and Indonesia each lost relations with only one major diplomatic partner: the other. Foreign Ministers Chen Yi and Dr. H. Subandrio, along with their ministries, came under repeated, violent, domestic attack. They were toppled and their foreign affairs systems thrown into severe disarray through radical, politically motivated, attacks and purges. Activist student groups in each country attacked the other nation's resident diplomatic facilities and personnel. Despite China's severely strained relations around the world the PRC managed to hold on to its ties with its other major partners. Indonesia, with an increasingly broad anti communist national program characterized by the Suharto New order regime's decimation of the Indonesian Communist Party, the PKI, continued its relations with all of its other communist diplomatic partners. This study uses Indonesian and Chinese internal government materials, as well as other Chinese and Indonesian language sources, to explore the cataclysmic domestic situations which played themselves out in their foreign relations. Taking a different approach than earlier accounts, this dissertation views the breakdown in relations from both sides through their own words, but also with the use of U.S. and British declassified documents, and other reference materials, to provide depth from third party perspectives. The use of memoirs of recently released political prisoners, and other first-hand accounts, combined with my translations of the contents of diplomatic notes between the two nations, all serve to challenge conventionally held views of the break in relations: that the split was inevitable, that China and the PKI were mainly responsible, that the Indonesian student attacks were spontaneous, that the Indonesian Chinese brought about the breakup, and other popularly held impressions.

304606080,"Young, Marian H.",Shengjing Shibao: Constructing public opinon in late Qing China,Contemporary,"This dissertation is concerned with the role of Shengjing Shibao (Shengjing Times), a Japanese-owned Chinese-language newspaper, in the construction of public opinion in Shenyang and its environs during the last five years of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). Using the concept of news framing, this study explores the power of print in the early issues of this initially 5,000-circulation daily newspaper, published in the leading city of northeastern China, beginning in 1906. Established by Japanese journalist Nakajima Masao (1859-1943), Shengjing shibao received financial assistance from Japan's consulate-general in Shenyang during its early years. It was published until the Second World War. Representing Japan's presence as a boon to the region, the newspaper urged its readers to consider the benefits of Sino-Japanese cooperation. In the wake of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5), Japan acquired rights and economic interests in the region from Russia due to its victory. These included a leasehold over the Liaodong Peninsula, renamed the Kwantung Leased Territory, a railway, and land along the railway. In addition, the newspaper provided its readers with news and views about the New Policies (Xinzheng), or the raft of reforms implemented by the Qing court and its officials, beginning in 1901. In particular, it covered the political reform process in Fengtian Province, including preparations for the province's first-ever elections, the indirect elections process, and the convening of the first-ever representative body, the Fengtian Provincial Assembly, in 1909. While interpreting the political reforms as a sign of progress and enlightenment, its pages did not encourage broad political participation, much less popular participation. Reporting on the October 14, 1909, convocation, for instance, it used a news frame that constrained broad participation in the new political process. Finally, the newspaper discouraged anti-imperialist Chinese nationalism targeted at Japan. When the 1909 anti-Japanese goods boycott movement arose in response to the September signing of the Manchurian Convention, which increased Japan's economic interests in the region, its pages publicized official Chinese pronouncements banning the boycott, but the newspaper provided little coverage of the protests themselves. Thus Shengjing shibao opened doors to political participation, albeit not very widely, in the waning years of the Qing dynasty as it competed to develop and shape public opinion in northeastern China.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Hawaii at Manoa,NA,NA,"History, Journalism, China, Informal empire, Newspapers, Public opinion, Qing dynasty, Shengjing Shibao",15,Honolulu,Hawaii,21.3294,-157.846,United States
304191573,"Jin, Qiu",The Lin Biao incident: A study of extra-institutional factors in the Cultural Revolution,Contemporary,"This dissertation is a study of the Lin Biao Incident of September 13, 1971, which refers to Marshal Lin Biao's reported defection to the Soviet Union when his aircraft crashed in the Mongolian desert. Lin and his wife and son were killed. The Incident remains an unsolved mystery. The Chinese government issued accusations of an aborted coup d'etat and a plot to assassinate Mao supposedly masterminded by Lin Biao, but failed to establish a convincing link between Lin and the crimes of which he was accused. This dissertation presents a different interpretation of the Incident. The Incident in its narrow sense was a consequence of the political involvement of family members during the Cultural Revolution. Based on this discovery, I made the Incident a case study of Chinese politics, illustrating the function of extra-institutional factors in the Cultural Revolution. I employed the concept of extra-institutional factors to make a distinction between two groups of factors that function in Chinese politics, those related to an institutional study, such as ideology, organizations, decision-making. and those social, cultural and human factors usually excluded from an institutional study. More specifically, by extra-institutional factors I mean such elusive things as personality, individual experience, and social relationships, including family ties and personal connections (guanxi) and loyalties as these function in the political sphere. In other words, I purposefully draw a distinction between two groups of general political phenomena--those that characterize or constitute political systems, and those that inform or pervade the context in which those systems function and provide meaning. Hopefully, this study of Chinese politics during the Cultural Revolution from a perspective that relates to the political culture and human behaviors of the leaders adds a useful perspective to the study of Chinese institutional history.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Hawaii at Manoa,NA,NA,"History, Political science, China",15,Honolulu,Hawaii,21.3294,-157.846,United States
303994221,"Kim, Ki-hoon","Japanese policy for Korean rural immigration to Manchukuo, 1932--1945",Contemporary,"This is a study of Japanese policy pertaining to Korean rural immigration to Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state created in 1932 following the 1931 Manchurian Incident. The Manchukuo period (1932-1945) was but the final stage of Korean immigration to Manchuria, which started in the late 1860s and ended in 1945. Nevertheless, the establishment of Manchukuo and the formulation of diverse Japanese policies greatly affected Korean rural migration into and settlement in Manchuria. Prior to 1931, measures employed by Chinese authorities in Manchuria had tended to restrain or offset attempts by the Japanese to influence Korean migration. From 1932, however, the Japanese had a free hand to deal with the question of Korean migration. This study raises the following questions: what did Japanese policy toward Korean rural immigration to Manchukuo entail. and what were the results of that policy? This study argues that Korean rural immigration policy developed through complex intergovernmental arrangements and that Japanese policy was not a fixed one. The Kwantung Army in Manchukuo, the Government-General of Korea, and the central government in Japan initially held different views as to the desirability of Korean immigration to Manchukuo. Domestic issues in each of the three jurisdictions, together with the exigencies of the continental and Pacific wars, continued to influence the positions of these governing bodies towards Korean immigration. Meanwhile, from 1932 to 1936 the Manchukuo government maintained a laissez-faire policy. between 1937 and 1945 it adopted specific measures for controlling immigration and settlement. Within this framework of control, the Japanese endeavored to promote stipulated amounts of Korean rural immigration. This study suggests that the Japanese were unable to implement policies for Korean rural immigration to Manchukuo as effectively as they had envisioned. Neither did they endeavor to promote such migration as consistently or positively as most accounts imply. Yet, legacies of these policies include the settlement of Koreans along the Manchurian borders and the presence today of approximately two million Koreans in China's three eastern provinces.",1992,1992,Ph.D.,United States,University of Hawaii at Manoa,NA,NA,"History, Political science, China, immigration policy",15,Honolulu,Hawaii,21.3294,-157.846,United States

This dissertation examines the role of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) in Taiwanese nationalism from 1945 to 1992, when the freedom of speech was granted to the people of Taiwan. It is contended that the PCT played a significant role in transforming the discourse on Taiwanese nationalism from ethnic to civic. In the face of the heavy diplomatic setbacks during the 1970s, the PCT began to propagate the idea of self-determination for all people in Taiwan through its publication of three statements. In these statements, the PCT claimed that self-determination is an inherent right ordained by God and regarded human rights and a homeland as gifts bestowed by God. The PCT also defined Taiwanese as all people who love the island and consider it home. This replaced the previous definition, in which Taiwanese narrowly referred to those who had been living in the island before the arrival of the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1945 and their descendants. The PCT'S proclamations challenged the legitimacy of the KNIT government and its official ideology of Chinese nationalism, which viewed the people in Taiwan and mainland China as comprising one Chinese nation. Generally, the PCT is known for its active involvement in the socio-political movements after the lifting of martial law in 1987. It is argued, however, that the greatest contribution of the PCT lies not in its role as a social agent of the democratic movements but in its role as a catalyst of discourse on civic Taiwanese nationalism, which is a product of its contextual theology. The civic discourse of Taiwanese nationalism was disseminated into the society through: (1)&#xa0.the PCT'S collaboration with the Tangwai (the opposition political group, which later became the Democratic Progressive Party in 1986).

4380000073,"Chen, Huiying",On the Road in Eighteenth-Century China,Modern,"Focused on travelers’ experience, this project examines how increased travel challenged the existing conventions and social structures in Qing China and how the state and society successfully sought and found creative and workable ways to acclimatize itself to the new social realities. Working with an array of sources, including commercial travel guides, travelogues, local gazetteers, maps, and litigation records, this dissertation elucidates the challenges that increased travel posed to eighteenth-century Chinese society, whose laws and conventions had favored sedentary ways of living as demanded by agriculture. A marked increase in traffic throughout the country produced a new set of social norms and values that we might think of as “early modern,” in the sense that active participation by individuals in the broader and broader circulation of bodies, goods, and information is a hallmark of that era. The various stakeholders in this transitional process negotiated compromises that required the system to accommodate change in order to continue to function effectively.

First, has I-Lan County developed a form of desakota settlement pattern described for other Asian countries by McGee? Second, what are the processive forces that contribute to this distinctive pattern of urbanization? Third, what are the consequences of this urbanization for the future development of the space economy for I-Lan and Northern Taiwan? Theories such as the central place, regional growth, state-centered and modernization use a rural-urban distinction to develop arguments for urbanization. In contrast, the desakota theory proposes the necessity to reevaluate the conventional distinction and develop a different perspective that sees the rural-urban diverse as a spatial continuum that moves from an urban core through a region of mixed rural and urban activities in a dominantly rural region. In Asian countries, desakota refers to regions of an intense mixture of agricultural and non-agricultural activities that stretch along corridors between city cores. This specific mode of the space economy cannot be separated from societal change (i.e., technological change and globalization) and institutional components, such as the role of the state. Thus, I develop a societal conceptual model—local-state driven qesakota urbanization—to investigate my first two research questions. The outcome of this societal model, desakota urbanization, is mediated by the growth of industrialization encouraged by institutional (state), individual (entrepreneurs) and structural (global linkages) actors. The rise and fall of these three actors create a full scale symphony of urbanization. There are three main findings in this study: (1)&#xa0.between 1895 and 1945, the central state's colonial policy and strength had major roles in channeling and controlling the impact of urbanization in I-Lan. In addition, the colonial form of development adopted by Japan emphasized the creation of I-Lan as a raw material supplier (rice, sugar and lumber) to the Japanese empire and eventually no industry developed. I-Lan's dependent development did not create urban primacy as the dependency/world-systems perspective predicted. In contrast, I-Lan was in a stage of transition to desakota urbanization by the end of the Japanese colonial rule. (2)&#xa0.after 1945, I-Lan County became more incorporated into the national and international space economy via a state policy, which encouraged investment of entrepreneurs, and Suao harbor's global linkages.

304895928,"Kyong-McClain, Jeffrey",Excavating the nation: Archaeology and control of the past and present in Republican Sichuan,Contemporary,"This dissertation considers whether or not archaeology was an effective tool for nation-building elites in Republican China (1912-1949), by looking at the discipline's fortunes in the off-center locale of Sichuan province. Through consideration of the multiplicity of agents and motives involved in archaeological enterprise in Republican Sichuan, Excavating the Nation shows that while nationalists believed the discipline held much propagandistic promise, in actual practice it failed to produce a coherent national narrative in the region. The modern discipline of archaeology developed in China, as it had elsewhere in the world, in tandem with modern nationalism. Many intellectuals in Republican China hoped that archaeology would prove a useful tool in their efforts to construct a new national history, one that did away with myths and Imperial genealogies and in their stead produced a history of the triumphs of the Chinese nation as it spread from the Yellow River outward for five thousand years. Such a narrative, however, never could completely gain traction in Sichuan, which throughout the Republic remained only very weakly connected to China's political and academic heartland. Instead, archaeology in Sichuan grew in several disparate directions. First, Protestant missionaries pioneered the discipline in Sichuan in the 1920s and 1930s, and while they made some inroads against antiquarian tradition, they were not themselves united over how best to interpret Sichuan's archaeological past, David Graham arguing for interpretations favorable to Chinese nationalism, but others defending understandings that placed their ethnically non-Chinese Christian converts more at the center of history. When Chinese archaeologists arrived in Sichuan en masse, during the War of Resistance against Japan (1937-1945), it seemed that archaeology in Sichuan might yet be useful in telling national history. However, the archaeologists affiliated with the central government met one problem after another as Buddhist monks refused to be awed by national treasures, the people resisted tomb excavation as a sacrilege, and local antiquarian Huang Xicheng defended the honor of Sichuan's native culture over that of the Central Plains Finally, Chinese nationalism had its greatest success on the archaeological front in Sichuan in reinterpreting archaeological sites in ways favorable to finding ethnic Han presence in Sichuan's antiquity, particularly in transforming Barbarian Caves into Han tombs, yet even here there was resistance. Ultimately, archaeological knowledge production in Republican Sichuan proved to be too unwieldy for Chinese nationalists, as it could not overcome diverse local opinion on Sichuan's past.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Modern history, Archaeology, China, Excavating, Nationalism, Republican China, Sichuan",11,Champaign,Illinois,40.1142,-88.2737,United States
304533378,"Guelcher, Gregory Paul",Dreams of empire: The Japanese agricultural colonization of Manchuria (1931--1945) in history and memory,Contemporary,"Although never formally annexed, Manchukuo ( Manshûkoku ), the puppet state established in 1932 under the auspices of Japan's Kwantung Army ( Kantôgun ), was often spoken of as the “jewel” of Japan's wartime empire. The Japanese gave careful attention to the economic development of Manchukuo, and the latter soon emerged as a vital source of the foodstuffs and raw materials Japan needed to prosecute the war effort. In order to secure the nation's hold over that territory, the Japanese government undertook to colonize Manchukuo with large numbers of landed emigrants from the Home Islands. Carefully planned as a national project during wartime, and justified largely on strategic grounds, the settlement of some 270,000 Japanese farmers (out of a projected five million individuals) still stands as the largest such emigration in Japan's modern history. In part, this study explores the constellation of public events and private concerns that came together in the early 1930s to revive a seemingly moribund dream of Japanese agrarian nationalism, newly focused on Manchuria as a “New Paradise” ( Shintenchi ) for the nation's indigent farming community. More importantly, this study focuses on the main agents of Japan's renewed imperial drive: the agricultural colonists themselves. The “Great Men” of Japanese imperial history such as Gotô Shinpei and Ishiwara Kanji, unfortunately, have long overshadowed the far more numerous agricultural colonists. Where historians have incorporated the latter into their studies of colonial Manchukuo, these “footsoldiers of empire” have generally been accorded neither voice nor agency. they exist simply as faceless agents of colonial oppression. By investigating the ways in which the Japanese state publicized life in Manchukuo. exploring the candidates' motivations for choosing the difficult option of emigration. scrutinizing the colonists' lifestyle abroad. probing their relations with the Kwantung Army, government officials and native Chinese. and examining in detail the fate that befell them upon Japan's defeat in August 1945, this study seeks to break new ground in approaching the Japanese colonial experience in Manchuria from the vantage of wartime social history and postwar historical memory.

The primary sources include imperial proclamations, court memorials, examination essays, epitaphs, letters, poems and compilations. Six areas will be focused on: First, Bo Juyi's life is/examined to ascertain how his world view was shaped by the Tang cultural framework, and to what extent his experience and writings reflected Tang society and history. Second, Bo Juyi's writings on marriage practices and husband/wife relationships are analyzed. I argue that during the Mid-Tang, harmony and intimacy between husband and wife became more important than politically and socially connecting two families. Third, the practices of courtesanship, which peaked during the Mid-Tang period, are investigated, and the connection between the dramatic rise of courtesan culture and the increasing dominance of the examination graduates in Mid-Tang society is made. Fourth, Bo Juyi's writings on feminine characteristics and feminine appearance are examined and found to demonstrate a shift from adherence to traditional Confucian norms to that of education and sexual attractiveness. Fifth, Bo Juyi's writings on women in family roles are examined and it is determined that the Mid-Tang culture preferred a talented daughter, a wise, capable wife, and benevolent, determined mother. The remaining part of the dissertation assesses the influence of popular culture on the writings of qing (love, passion) as well as Bo Juyi's popularity as a writer of qing.

The Qianlong emperor sought to appeal to the values of the Han Chinese literati in writings where he discusses his own understanding of Chinese ideals pertaining to statecraft, emphasizing how it is necessary for the ruler to share political power and concede to authority external to himself. Both officials and private publishers disseminated copies of the emperor’s writings through a variety of channels, most notably commercial bookstores and academies. Active cooperation between officials and the local elite was also crucial in the use of institutions to collect books for the bibliographic project “The Complete Collection of the Four Treasuries”, which the emperor initiated in order to showcase his support for civil learning. I argue that the variety of social classes and channels involved both in the distribution of imperially authored works and in the collection of books demonstrated an approach to consolidating political legitimacy that was more subtle and indirect than other methods that have been studied. I demonstrate that the eighteenth-century Chinese state sought to deploy soft power through the use of print media to appeal to the values of their subjects, reflecting strategies for affirming political legitimacy similar to those used by modern states.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"History, Asian Studies, Political science, China, Political legitimacy, Publishing, Qianlong, Rulership, Soft power",11,Champaign,Illinois,40.1142,-88.2737,United States
1426157426,"Harris, Lane Jeremy","The Post Office and state formation in modern China, 1896-1949",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the myriad ways the Imperial/Chinese Post Office contributed to the formation of the modern Chinese state in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In particular, this is a study of how the nineteenth and twentieth century internal and external crises in China began a process in which the Post Office played an instrumental role in transforming the presiding state of an agrarian empire into a centralizing nation-state. In the midst of that transformation, the Post Office contributed to the shift of the locus of sovereignty from the person of the Emperor to the impersonal state. Originating in 1896, the Chinese Post Office became universal within the country by the Communist victory in 1949. The Post Office survived as an administrative entity throughout this entire period because its foreign and Chinese administrators pursued strategies to insulate, protect, and strengthen this “non-political” institution from external disruption and territorial division. In the midst of protecting its territorial integrity, the Post Office also challenged and out-competed six other pre-existing postal services on Chinese soil. In attaining its monopoly, the Post Office occupied the entire geographically-defined territory of China as the postal monopolist and attained international recognition as sovereign in postal affairs. As a new-style interventionist central government institution, the Post Office not only carried mail, but also heavily subsidized the modern press and offered a wide variety of “public services” such as money orders, parcel post, postal savings, and simple life insurance to transform society and the economy as an “extramarket” force mitigating some of the negative effects of capitalist development. Coupled the Post Office’s role as an extramarket agent was its creation and control over a new “information infrastructure” for the modern Chinese nation-state. Within this infrastructure, the Post Office coordinated all modern and traditional forms of transportation, filling in the gaps with its own couriers, to revolutionize the sense of space, time, and speed in Chinese society and create a new informational environment for the modern nation-state. Controlling that infrastructure allowed the Post Office to become the most important censoring institution of the Republican state through its ability to place institutional controls on the circulation of information. If the Post Office intervened negatively in the public sphere through censorship, it also positively advocated for itself by creating its corporate identity through the use of sophisticated public relations techniques that blurred the lines between public information and advertising. Finally, the Post Office was one of the most important state institutions maintaining contact with overseas Chinese networks through its long-term relationship with Qiaopiju remittance firms. In the midst of that relationship, the Post Office facilitated the transnationalization of the state by creating its own overseas remittance network. In sum, this dissertation argues that sandwiched between the establishment of a modern Postal Service in 1896 and the Communist takeover in 1949, the late Qing, warlord, and Nationalist governments created the structures of an internationally-recognized, and internally-coherent, independent and territorially-sovereign state. One of the most important state institutions in this process was the Chinese Post Office.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,NA,NA,"History, China, Communications, Maritime Customs Service, Post Office, Postal Service, Republican Era, State formation",11,Champaign,Illinois,40.1142,-88.2737,United States
304605033,"Israel, George Lawrence","On the margins of the grand unity: Empire, violence, and ethnicity in the virtue ethics and political practice of Wang Yangming (1472–1529)",Modern,"This is a comprehensive study of the military campaigns of the renowned Ming Chinese philosopher Wang Yangming (1472-1529), with the aim of better understanding the relation between, on the one hand, his Neo-Confucian political philosophy and ethics and, on the other, empire, ethnicity, and violence during the Ming. Previous studies of Wang Yangming have placed emphasis on his philosophy and intellectual development, while remaining satisfied with simplistic readings of this most important phase of his career as a Ming scholar-official. By taking advantage of his corpus of memorials to the Ming court and other official communications, and placing them within a broader context allowed by other relevant Ming sources, this study achieves a reconstruction of the argumentative- and decision-making context for Wang Yangming as he went about the process of suppressing rebellions and resistance by a number of marginal social and ethnic groups in southern China, and putting in place measures in the aftermath to maintain order. Previous interpretations of the relationship between Wang Yangming's Neo-Confucian philosophy—his learning of the mind-heart—and his political career (practice) have generally been framed in the larger context of a reading of Neo-Confucianism as a whole. Condemnatory interpretations of Neo-Confucian philosophy yield an agent of feudal ethics and autocratic despotism engaging in acts of repression. celebratory interpretations yield a man of passionate humanity responding to his conscience. This study eschews a simplistic reading of Wang Yangming's actions and policies as an official by showing the promises and limitations of his political philosophy and ethics as he went about the process of defining the situations of conflict he confronted, determining the identities and motivations of those caught up in them, and deciding on what he believed to be a just course of action. Indeed, the assumptions he brought to the table about human nature and the ends of political life at times opened up the possibility for dialogue and a peaceful resolution of conflict, while at others leading to employment of the military instrument. By placing Wang Yangming's ethical philosophy in the context of his official career, it becomes evident that his most fundamental notions were inseparable from the paternalistic civilizing practices of Ming empire, with all the consequences this entailed.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,NA,NA,"History, China, Empire, Ethnicity, Ming dynasty, Neoconfucianism, Political philosophy, Political practice, Violence, Virtue ethics, Wang, Shouren, Wang, Yangming",11,Champaign,Illinois,40.1142,-88.2737,United States
1426157430,"Hur, Hyungju","Staging modern statehood: World exhibitions and the rhetoric of publishing in late Qing China, 1851–1910",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines how the objective of the Qing government to stage its modern statehood through participating in the world exhibitions and hosting the Nanyang Industrial Exposition of 1910, the first national / international exhibition of China, was challenged and transformed by various agents with different views and rhetorics regarding the representation of China at the exhibitions. The Imperial Maritime Customs, a product of European imperialist encroachment on China, echoed the imperialist discourse on an “uncivilized” China. Simultaneously, Japan strove to demonstrate its status as the only “modern” or “civilized” state in Asia at the world exhibitions and continuously attempted to overwhelm China with its more grandiose exhibits, including those from its colony, Taiwan. In the wake of the Hundred Days’ Reforms of 1898, Chinese intellectuals were becoming increasingly antagonistic toward the Qing government, whose incompetence and corruption were considered major reasons for the humiliating representations of China at world exhibitions, particularly those at the Osaka Exhibition of 1903 and the St. Louis Exposition of 1904. Furthermore, by taking advantage of a transnational network of publication operating beyond the control of the Qing government, the Chinese reformers and revolutionaries circulated rhetorical attacks on the Qing government, undermining its political legitimacy. They condemned the Qing government as the cause of “national humiliation.” Their coverage of the Chinese exhibit was often exaggerated, even fabricated. However, by the time the Nanyang Industrial Exposition was held in 1910, the Qing government had agreed to establish a cabinet and a parliament in order to transform China into a modern, constitutional state. As a result, the Chinese intellectuals adopted a supportive stance toward the exposition, thereby embodying the political reconciliation between the Qing government and the Chinese intellectuals under the rhetoric of constitutionalism. This dissertation shows that the representations of China at the world exhibitions during the late Qing period bespeak, on the one hand, the obstacles China encountered in building a modern state worthy of participation in world exhibitions, and on the other, how their modernizing efforts contributed paradoxically to the undermining of its own legitimacy through transnational communication and the movement of populations in East Asia.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,NA,NA,"History, China, Publishing, Qing dynasty, Sino-Japanese relations, Statehood, World exhibitions",11,Champaign,Illinois,40.1142,-88.2737,United States

305328899,"Du, Yongtao","Locality, identity, and geography: Translocal practices of Huizhou merchants in late imperial China",Modern,"This dissertation is a study of cultural formation in late imperial China from the perspective of spatial mobility. Based on the recent scholarship of commercialization and local history, it asks how the broadening spatial movement impacted the existing institutions and practices such as lineage, local identity, and geographical imagination. To capture the horizontal and relational nature of these dynamic processes across space, while at the same time recognizing the importance of highly developed local communities in late imperial China, I use the term translocality. It is defined as the frequent and periodic movements between local places by people who were deeply rooted in local societies back home. Based on research on the merchants from the Huizhou Prefecture, I argue that translocality involves not only motion across local boundaries, but also the transformation of ideas, practices, and institutions that had developed either in local arenas or by the state with regard to the localized communities. Thus I demonstrate that, first, local identity was constructed in relation to other places rather than just the hierarchical order of the state administration. second, lineage practice extended beyond the local arena and incorporated kinsmen in two or more distant places, resulting in the incongruence of kinship identity and local identity, third, the merchants' geographical imagination of the empire deviated from the official vision of a vertically organized spatial hierarchy, representing it instead as a web of horizontally interconnected places, finally, the methods with which the Chinese imperial state managed bureaucratic recruitment and local administration were also modified to cope with these increasing spatial movements of its population. Recognizing, with local history, the diversity of local environments in China, I try to dispose of the (sometimes inadvertent) implication that these diverse locales were discrete. By highlighting the interconnectedness that was created by the movement of people, this dissertation brings out the social spaces created between local places, and sheds light on the dynamic processes by which the understanding of locality, the formation of place-related identities, the modes of geographical imagination, as well as the state's administration of spatial order all went through significant transformations.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,NA,NA,"History, Geography, China, Geography, Huizhou, Identity, Late imperial, Locality, Merchants, Translocality",11,Champaign,Illinois,40.1142,-88.2737,United States

Under three political regimes—the Qing Empire, Japanese colonial rule, and the post-war Nationalist regime, POJ, originally created by the Presbyterian Church missionaries for Taiwanese peoples in the 1860s, was utilized in proselytism, school education, medical study, and as an expression of Taiwanese culture and nationalism under different social, political, and cultural circumstances. Looking into the various ways whereby POJ has become symbolically associated with different identities deepens our understanding of how it was important in the process and politics of identity making in modern Taiwan.

Using Taiwanese women's magazines as a site of analysis, my dissertation offers a history of the changing articulations of femininity from the 1950s to the present, with an emphasis on the relationships among gender identity, consumption, nation formation, and globalization. As scripts of femininity, women's magazines are produced out of particular cultural institutions which are situated within the larger global economy. My dissertation provides an analysis of the “political economy” of the magazine industry by emphasizing how the nation building project and global capitalism shaped the practices used in the magazine industry. Particularly, it looks into the mandatory use of market research—a result of the expansion of multinational ad agencies—in reconfiguring the “field” of magazine production. Second, it discusses the changing industrial practices in transforming the industry's “imagined” readers from patriotic and domestic housewives to “public” and “international” consumers. It looks into how the changing conception of readership shapes women's magazines' textual practices from an emphasis on defining femininity as private to femininity as public. It also explores how this changing gender identity enables women to participate in the process of globalization with respect to their role as workers and consumers. Third, the dissertation addresses the role of women's magazines in regulating women's sexual practices. In particular, it investigates the interrelationships between the normative sexual practices and the state's nation-building project through a discussion of Taiwan's population control policies and its economic and political imperatives to build an international nation.

Organized through the Six Companies, their influence decisively shaped late Qing policy toward exclusion. The dissertation examines the role of Cantonese merchants in Chinese immigration. It sees Chinese exodus to California within the context of wider sphere of Chinese emigration resulting from the meeting of old and new market economies. In addition to their role spearheading immigration, Chinese merchants also formed a powerful influence within the Chinese immigrant communities. They brought their native-place association or huiguan tradition with them and established the Six Companies, a federation of huiguan in California. Like their counterparts in China and other countries, the Six Companies operated not only as an arbiter of community disputes but also a vehicle for meeting outside challenges which affected their members. The anti-Chinese movement gravely injured Chinese merchants and the Six Companies became the chief target. In this respect, I argue that the long-standing perception that the Six Companies functioned as the main Chinese labor brokers was an ideological construction that is unsupported by empirical evidence. In the early period the Six Companies became the defender of the Chinese and effectively and simultaneously fought against the anti-Chinese movement on several fronts. More importantly, the Six Companies profoundly shaped late Qing policy toward the United States. Firstly, late Qing opposition to Chinese exclusion stemmed from the petitions of the Six Companies which led to the establishment of the first Chinese legation in the United States. Also, spokesmen for the Chinese community, the Six Companies set the rhetorical tone and defined the strategies for subsequent struggles of the Chinese diplomats. The Qing legation followed the Six Companies' leadership in defending Chinese treaty rights, demanding indemnity, litigating on behalf of Chinese civil and property rights, and lobbying for liberalizing the immigration legislation and reforming Chinese community.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of Iowa,NA,NA,"American history, History, Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, China, Chinese-American, Exclusion, Huiguan, Merchants, Nineteenth century, Six Companies",6,Iowa City,Iowa,41.6559,-91.5303,United States

The policy was advocated by the Ministry of the Interior as a rural social welfare policy, by the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation as one aspect of state farm development, and by the Communist Youth League as a national service campaign for young volunteers. The specific and institutional origins of the policy and its goals were themselves embedded in a complex matrix of historical legacies, individual actors and contemporary exigencies. It was conceived as a means to redistribute Chinese population to western areas and to expand China's cultivated area. The plan was inspired partly by the Soviet Union's agricultural modernization measures, especially the Virgin Lands program, but had been proposed already in the 1920s and had an ancient historical lineage. I conceptualize resettlement as a frontier policy component of a grand strategy to increase the national wealth and security of the People's Republic. The policy was certainly shaped by the tumultuous Party struggles in the late 1950s but its most important impetuses were strategic, developmental and instrumental rather than political or ideological. The larger historical context is Chinese frontier policy generally and the expansion of the agricultural frontier in Qinghai province. Most of the agricultural resettlers, were urban poor or farmers. In this, they were quite different from the educated youth and sent-down cadres of the Cultural Revolution. They were recruited under the banner of “supporting the frontiers and building the motherland,” made the thousand kilometer journey west and lived in what seemed a foreign land. Social friction between locals and in-migrants was exacerbated by Qinghai's poverty. the Party struggled to get the newcomers to “put down roots, blossom and bear fruit.” As a local history, my dissertation begins to mesh the short-term, national and political history of this population movement with the long term, local and ethnic history of the Sino-Tibetan frontier.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Iowa,NA,NA,"History, Agriculture, Agricultural resettlement, China, Rural conditions, Sino-Tibetan frontier, Tibetan frontier",6,Iowa City,Iowa,41.6559,-91.5303,United States

Through an examination of the current literature on Republican China, Protestant fundamentalism, and missions history in China the thesis will examine these three distinct, but often overlapping, contexts that profoundly shaped the fundamentalist movement in China. Wang's interaction with this complex context will be seen primarily through an analysis of his autobiography and the seven volume collection of his sermons and articles. The three contexts will be developed in the first three chapters. First, Wang and the fundamentalists lived in a dynamic period of Chinese history. By the start of Wang's ministry, numerous Chinese urban intellectuals, including many Christians, were influenced by Western-inspired modernism. Second, Wang adopted a specific form of Christianity, Protestant fundamentalism. As a fundamentalist, Wang internalized an assortment of predispositions in relationship to the modern world and ideas. While he served as a critic of modernism, he also, in some ways, shared with the intellectuals a modern worldview. Thirdly, fundamentalism emerged in the immediate context of Chinese opposition to Western imperialism and missions. The anti-Christian movement of the 1920s propelled the development of independent Chinese churches and, as will be examined in Chapter 4, shaped Wang's interaction with nationalism and imperialism. The thesis, in the final two chapters, will look specifically at the writing of Wang Mingdao. As a fundamentalist in urban China during the 1920s, Wang internalized a distinctive theology and worldview. With that worldview, Wang's thinking corresponded with some of the new popular and modern ideas and language of his age, such as equality and democracy. At the same time, Wang also latched on to several notions that many Chinese might consider traditional. He found in fundamentalism a form of Christianity that echoed traditional Chinese emphasis on orthodoxy and personal piety. Fundamentalism provided Wang Mingdao with a language that allowed him to introduce some of the new and fashionable notions from the West as well as champion some cherished traditional Chinese.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of Iowa,NA,NA,"History, Religious history, China, Culture, Fundamentalism, Popular language, Republican, Wang Mingdao",6,Iowa City,Iowa,41.6559,-91.5303,United States
304509962,"Tucker, David Vance","Building our Manchukuo: Japanese city planning, architecture, and nation-building in occupied northeast China, 1931--1945",Contemporary,"Beginning in late 1931, Japan expanded and consolidated its colonial management of Northeast China by seizing the entire region and establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo. Until the collapse of the Japanese Empire in 1945, Manchukuo's Japanese managers carried out an extensive program of state, economic and infrastructure development. Considering state and economic planning to be closely related, they integrated them. Physical planning, city building and architecture were at one intersection of their concerns for economic development, state power, and representation of authority and state ideology. Construction was fundamental to the new state, and a central metaphor by which its creators understood and articulated their ambitions to build an ideal state and society, with model cities to enable an ideal way of life. They did not confine these goals to Northeast China. Manchukuo was a project of reconstruction also aimed at the rest of China and Japan. These were utopian ambitions beyond the resources of the Japanese Empire, and the Manchukuo project soon began to encounter obstacles that it was unable to overcome. Nevertheless, planners still envisioned Northeast China as an “empty page,” and continued the attempt to construct ideal, utopian cities there. This dissertation approaches the construction of Manchukuo from various perspectives. It examines the development of the flexible concept of Manchuria, which was easily remade into Manchukuo. It examines Japanese systems of regional colonial management before and after the formation of Manchukuo. It traces the development of Japanese city planning, and planners eagerness to find an “empty page” outside of Japan where they could realize the ideal cities denied them in Japan.

304988165,"Gao, Yunxiang","Sports, gender, and nation-state during China's “national crisis” from 1931 to 1945",Contemporary,"Chinese women's sports and physical education (“ tiyu ”) developed in the first half of the twentieth century in an atmosphere of foreign menace and national crisis. Tiyu was promoted as part of nation-building, a tool to reshape bodies, to redefine Chinese masculinity and femininity, to counter the haunting effeminate image of the “Sick Man of Asia,” and to bring China to the status of a strong and independent nation. The rapid growth of Chinese women's tiyu brought physical education into girls' schools and female tiyu professionals to teach it. Chinese women participated in highly publicized national and international athletic competitions. Media representations displayed strikingly changed ideas of liberated modern women's appearances and behavior. The new aesthetic and fashion concept of jianmei , the robust beauty of a healthy, athletic woman, allowed sleeker clothing for fit bodies. During the period of Japanese aggression from 1931 to 1945, the Nationalist government's centralizing policies regarding tiyu increasingly emphasized masculinity, military training, and war preparation. Women's roles appeared contradictory. State ideology insisted women should nurture the threatened Chinese masculinity while in the interest of public morals the state tried to regulate female dress and behavior. The experiences of two outstanding, neglected women illustrate these themes: Zhang Huilan (1898–1996), the first Chinese woman to get a Ph.D. in physical education and the first Chinese Chair of the Tiyu Department at Ginling Women's College, and Li Lili (1915–), the “athletic movie star.” These women served as distinctive discourses for institutional powers to influence nation building through the manipulation of women's bodies. Simultaneously, their international experiences brought Chinese nation-state-building into a global context. This study of the role of Chinese women and tiyu in nation-building examines the interaction among social and political forces, including Western missionaries, various nationalist groups, and urban literate feminists, gender ideologies of citizens, and “tiyu”.

303875849,"Chu, Christina",Li Liufang: The life and art of a late Ming literatus. (Volumes I and II),Modern,"The painting career of Li Liufang spanned a period of twenty-six years as shown by his earliest extant dated works of 1602 and the last dated work of 1628. His paintings testify to a stylistic evolution successively influenced by Huang Gongwang, Wang Meng, Wu Zhen, Ni Zan and Dong Qichang and ultimately evolving an individual style. Li Liufang was also accomplished in the arts of poetry, calligraphy, seal carving, bamboo carving and rock gardening. He was esteemed as one fo the Nine Friends of Painting as well as the Four Gentlemen of Jiading. Li Liufang led the life of a recluse in his rustic abode of Sandalwood Garden (Tanyuan) until his death in 1629. His style was carried on by his son, Li Hangzhi, and many literatus painters who expressed admiration for his life and art. As an individualist and a non-conformist, Li Liufang was considered a literati role model. Through the practice of Li Liufang's style, these later artists aimed to emulate a literati ideal. Li Liufang, being a prolific writer has left us a collection of poems, essays and inscriptions in his book Anthology of the Sandlewood Garden (Tanyuan ji) in which he recorded his travels, his life, details of his environment, and comments and criticisms on art. Massive writing by contemporary literati associates, gazettes of Jiangnan, Suzhou, Taicang and Jiading, traditional documentations and references in painting catalogues also add to our knowledge of the life and work of Li Liufang. This study has been undertaken in order to reconstruct a chronology of Li Liufang's life and work which will lead to some interesting revelations about the late Ming/Early Qing painting. Through an understanding of Li Liufang's localized influence in the Jianding area, one can get an insight into the nature of his role in transmitting and perpetuating the literati style formulated by the orthodox theorist Dong Qichang as well as a sense of continuity that was evident in the subsequent development of the history of Chinese painting.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,University of Kansas,NA,NA,"Art History, Fine Arts, History, Biographies, China",12,Lawrence,Kansas,38.9597,-95.2642,United States
304696844,"Chou, Yeongchau",Reexamination of Tang Hou and his “Huajian”,Contemporary,"Tang Hou, an early Yuan connoisseur, has been forgotten in the core of Chinese art history until the late 20 th century. He experienced the political transition between the Chinese Southern Song and the Yuan Mongols in the 1270s and was nurtured by dynamic artistic and cultural bursts in the Jiangnan, particularly Hangzhou and near areas from the late 1280s to the very early 1300. Studies show that the market in antique art in Hangzhou was very bustling after the fall of the Southern Song and arouse an interest in collecting and appraising paintings at the same time. Prosperity of the art market and expansion of taste in painting generated some unique ideas in art in the early Yuan. Tang Hou, along with some other famous connoisseurs and collectors, was inspired under this fashion and contributed his connoisseurial knowledge in recording paintings that were accessible to him in his lifetime. Tang Hou, however, geared his painting records in a systemic and theoretical approach. and revealed some important notions in his Huajian (Examination of Painting) about written between late 1280s and 1300s. His unique concepts, were overlooked, became a dominant force in the painting development in the fifteenth century and onward. and further foreshadowed the formation of literati painting theory by Dong Qichang in the seventeenth century. This dissertation is the first careful study of Tang Hou and his Huajian . I reconstruct Tang Hou's life, political career, and his associations with the early Yuan elite and important figures. and further situate him among the advocators and leaders of literary and artistic movements in the early Yuan. In addition, this study also sheds light on the artistic context of the time in which Tang Hou's artistic criteria developed in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries China.

305516421,"Cho, Insoo",Images of Liu Haichan: The formation and transformation of a Daoist immortal's iconography,Modern,"This dissertation examines the formation and transformation of the iconography of a Daoist immortal, Liu Haichan. Liu Haichan was a court official in the tenth century who became a famous Daoist immortal. He has been worshipped as the fourth patriarch of the Quanzhen School, one of the largest schools of religious Daoism since the 13th century. From the middle of the Ming period, he has been extraordinarily popular and gradually transformed into a folk symbol of good fortune. Many images of Liu Haichan have been produced in various formats, such as painting, prints, and craft works. In art, he is usually represented carrying an auspicious three-legged toad. The earliest extant picture of Liu Haichan is dated to the Yuan period, and his image was a popular subject matter from the Ming period onward. However, no textual descriptions explained his association with the three-legged toad until the late Ming period. This discrepancy between text and image has led to questions about the original identity of the “Toad Immortal.” Sometimes other immortals are proposed to replace Liu Haichan. These candidates, however, do not qualify. Judging from fictions of the Song period, hagiographies of the Yuan period, and many other later records, Liu Haichan is still the most plausible person to be this immortal. Along with the popularization of the cult of Liu Haichan, the pictorial representation of him has changed from a serious wanderer to a cheerful young boy. It is also a change from a religious immortal to a secular figure and from a symbol of spiritual enlightenment to that of monetary luck. These changes occurred in response to religious, political and social situations. The transformation of Liu Haichan's iconography is also accompanied by the change of the styles, functions and meanings of the images. Some pictures of the later period show an amalgamation of Liu Haichan and Shide, an eccentric Buddhist monk of the Tang period. This indicates the visual syncretism of Daoism and Buddhism.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of Kansas,NA,NA,"Art History, History, China, Daoist, Iconography, Immortal, Liu Haichan",12,Lawrence,Kansas,38.9597,-95.2642,United States

304346669,"Tsai, Hsing-li",Ch'en Hung-shou's Elegant Gathering: A late Ming pictorial manifesto of Pure Land Buddhism,Modern,"Ch'en Hung-shou's Elegant Gathering (Ya-chi t'u), a handscroll in the Shanghai Museum of Art, can be read as a pictorial manifesto of one of the most significant cultural developments of the late-Ming period: the widespread acceptance of Pure Land Buddhism among intellectuals. The scroll presents a monk and eight scholars, including the Kung-an School literary theorists Yuan Hung-tao (1568-1610) and his brother Yuan Tsung-tao (1560-1600), gathered around a figure of a Buddhist deity in a garden setting. The subject of this picture has been identified as a meeting of the Grape Society, a club organized by the Yuan brothers in Beijing in the last years of the sixteenth century. In this dissertation, however, I argue that this work neither represents the Grape Society nor falls within the familiar category of literary meeting pictures. Rather, it treats a theme with special meaning for the artist and patron of the scroll as well as for the individuals portrayed, namely a shared belief in Pure Land Buddhism. Collectively, they represent the two generations of the lay Buddhist movement led by the two Pure Land masters, Chu-hung (1535-1615) and Chih-hsu (1599-1655). The composition can be linked to the most famous painting inspired by a Pure Land gathering of laymen and monks, The Lotus Society, by the Northern Sung Master Li Kung-lin (ca. 1041-1106). A more immediate source of inspiration, however, was undoubtedly Yuan Hung-tao's Hsi-fang ho-lun (Comprehensive Commentary on the Western Paradise). Investigation of Ch'en Hung-shou's other Buddhist paintings further elucidates the artist's embrace of Buddhist teaching in art. Often shared by these works is the concept of nonduality, the Buddhist teaching most attracted the late-Ming intelligentsia. These works not only display the intermingling of literati and Buddhist activities as the daily experience of a late-Ming intellectual but also visualize the prevalent intellectual intercourse between the late-Ming Buddhist masters and lay Buddhist literati. Ch'en Hung-shou's Buddhist paintings, as a whole, is representative of the cultural consequences of late-Ming revival of Buddhism. They offer us examples of the parallel developments in art and thought of late-Ming China. The concurrent secular and Buddhist traditions as well as the incorporation of Confucian elements into Buddhist paintings evidence the thorough sinicization of Buddhism by the late Ming. Elegant Gathering, in addition to expressing the concept of nonduality, identifies the Pure Land practice as a way to attain the ultimate goal. It can be read as a pictorial document that highlights Yuan Hung-tao's significance as a lay Buddhist in late-Ming history and affirms his contribution in the propagation of Pure Land Buddhism through Hsi-fang ho-lun. At the same time, it can be perceived as a pictorial manifesto in which Ch'en Hung-shou and the patron advocated their Pure Land beliefs on behalf of Yuan Hung-tao and in which they voiced their full agreement with Yuan Hung-tao's Buddhist beliefs addressed in the book. In a broader sense, this handscroll can be seen as a microcosm which represents the late-Ming lay Buddhist movement and signifies the overwhelming popularity of Pure Land Buddhism among Chinese intellectuals.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,University of Kansas,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Religion, Buddhism, China, painting",12,Lawrence,Kansas,38.9597,-95.2642,United States

It is divided into two parts: The Traditional City and The City Transformed. The first part, The Traditional City, consists of three chapters. The first chapter describes and evaluates the major analytical approaches that have been used to examine cities in China. It concludes with a brief description of recent scholarship on Tientsin. The second sketches the city's place in the administrative hierarchy of North China and describes the geography of the immediate area. It concludes with a synthetic picture foreign travellers have given of Tientsin and the surrounding region. The third chapter, using a police census compiled in 1842, presents the county and city as they appeared to local officials. It is unique and valuable not only because it describes the population of the settlements in the county, but also records the occupation of every head of household. It is thus possible to discover the incidence of occupations in every settlement in the county and in the city. The second part, the City Transformed, describes the city during the Boxer Rebellion and its immediate aftermath. The fourth chapter is a narrative of the month-long siege and battle of Tientsin. It describes Chinese and foreign military activities as well as the sufferings of the civilians and the material destruction. The last chapter describes the activities of the Tientsin Provisional Government which ran the city for the twenty-five months between July 1900 and August 1902. It physically transformed the city, installing a wide range of urban amenities, including a new transportation system, an electric lighting system, as well as sewage and water supply systems. A brief set of conclusions explains why Tientsin was, after 1902, a city sui generis. It was not the traditional city described in part one and was different from every other Chinese treaty port. It was evolving into a Sino-foreign city. It also suggests future areas of fruitful research into Tientsin's history.",1988,1988,Ph.D.,United States,University of Kansas,NA,NA,"History, China",12,Lawrence,Kansas,38.9597,-95.2642,United States
304603225,"Huang, Hua-lun","The Chiang Kai -shek regime and state crime in China and Taiwan, 1927–1975",Contemporary,"In April, 1927, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek established the Nationalist regime in Nanking. This act appeared to end the warlord period of China which, since President Yuan Shi-kai died in 1916, had been divided by provincial warlords. But, as a matter of fact, the Kuomintang state remained factionalized, weak, and unstable because a certain portion of China was still controlled by regional militarists and the Chinese communists. Facing such a disunited political situation, the Kuomintang state managers resorted to various types of organized crime to maintain their rulership. The purpose of this dissertation is to explain the variations of the Chiang government's use of state crime over time. The following topics are covered: (1)&#xa0. Theories of state criminality : Contemporary criminologists have constructed several theoretical and conceptual frameworks to explain the underlying cause(s) of government crime. I summarize and compare three of these theories (conflict, structural contradictions, and political climate) to see if they are appropriate to apply to the Kuomintang case. (2)&#xa0. The patron-client relationship between the KMT state and organized crime syndicates : Some researchers and investigative reporters have noted that state managers in the West sometimes will hire super gangs or organized crime enterprises to kill or intimidate some individuals or groups. The second goal of this dissertation is to explore the extent to which Qing Bang (the Green Gang) and Hong Men (the Red Society) got involved in the “killing business” of the Chiang regime. (3)&#xa0. Categories of the KMT state-connected crime : This section focuses on three kinds of crime which, during the time interval of 1927 to 1975, had been carried out by the KMT agents. They were political assassinations, massacres, and political imprisonment. Research methods . Analyzing state criminality usually is a very difficult task because it is not easy to get the necessary data to support or refute modern theories of government crime. To handle this problem in a way that can be accepted by professionals, I rely chiefly on historical documents to support my argument. Findings . Based on extant historical data, this dissertation shows that current theories of state crime only partially explain the incidents of the Nationalist regime-connected crime.

In the review of these issues in relationship to the abolition of the unequal treaties, this thesis represents my reconsideration of the first period of the Chinese parliamentary experience and the problems which persisted in the later Nationalist era and the People's Republic. Increasingly seeing post-1949 China as a continuous part of instead of as a total rupture from earlier Chinese history, more and more scholars have begun to re-appraise Republican China, especially its relevance to contemporary China's modernization and democratization.

304240633,"Wang, Chen-Shiuen",Faction politics in Taiwan: A perspective on patron-client theory,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the patron-client relationship between the Kuomintang (KMT) of Taiwan and local factions. Since the arrival of the Nationalist Government at the end of WWII, the KMT has been the dominant party in Taiwan and has used local factions to mobilize political support. The KMT's initial challenge was to establish regime legitimacy when the Communists took over mainland China. Local factions helped the KMT build a grass roots base of support, particularly in rural areas. Under martial law, the KMT controlled political and economic power in Taiwan without serious opposition challenge. But rapid socioeconomic growth, industrialization, and democratization ended authoritarian rule: in 1986, opposition forces united as the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). martial law was lifted in 1987. the New Party was formed by KMT defectors in 1993. In the past ten years, the KMT has struggled to maintain its political majority in the Central Government. Its strategy has been to fortify patron-client relationships with local factions. While the KMT's urban support base has eroded, rural support has remained. As this dissertation will show, however, the KMT's reliance on local factions has been costly: a rising deficit, uncontrolled government spending, increased national debt, widening socioeconomic gap between urban and rural areas, and widespread corruption at the local and central levels of government have occurred. While the KMT has benefited from local faction support, the political benefits have not matched the economic cost. The author believes that the KMT's patron-client relationships with local factions will eventually collapse as clientelism is further challenged by democratization.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Kansas,NA,NA,"Political science, History, China",12,Lawrence,Kansas,38.9597,-95.2642,United States
2704005886,"Yan, Weitian ",Envisioning Antiquity: Yi Bingshou and the Politics of Memory in the Qing Dynasty,Modern,"Beginning in the seventeenth century, engraved texts on ancient monuments became a vital source for Confucian scholarship and artistic practice in China. Scholars used these inscriptions to establish meanings of Confucian classics, verify recorded historical events, and reconstruct lost sites of cultural legacy. This methodological trend, known as kaozheng, or Evidential Scholarship, stresses the importance of textual analysis to the attainment of authentic knowledge of the past. Intrigued by the materiality and archaic scripts of these engravings, painters and calligraphers of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) deployed prodigious efforts to interpret them in different media in pursuit of aesthetic originality. This stylistic revolution, later termed beixue, or the “stele tradition,” advocates the engraved calligraphy on early stelae as the ideal model. My dissertation examines how Yi Bingshou (1754–1815), a key figure in the stele tradition, employed archaic styles of calligraphy to establish new aesthetic standards, commemorate historical figures, and negotiate meaningful social connections. Drawing on the social theories of memory, I have chosen three crucial episodes in Yi’s life and art to investigate the antiquarian culture of Qing China, involving critical reflections upon the genesis of the stele tradition, the re-invention of historical figures, and the modes of artistic patronage. The case of Yi offers a vantage point to reconsider the varied roles of artistic writings in the production of space, memory, and identity. It also helps illuminate the intellectual transformation toward “authenticity,” “materiality,” and “medium” behind the formation of new aesthetic judgements.",2022,2022,Ph.D.,United States,University of Kansas,History of Art,History,NA,12,Lawrence,Kansas,38.9597,-95.2642,United States
305299084,"Lai, Kuo-Sheng","Learning new painting from Japan and maintaining national pride in early twentieth century China, with focus on Chen Shizeng (1876–1923)",Contemporary,"In the early twentieth century, many Chinese painters went to Japan to study. This dissertation argues that, despite learning from Japan, these artists sought to create a better future for Chinese painting. They did not desire to create a single kind of Eastern painting with their Japanese counterparts. The Chinese had long claimed a kind of cultural superiority, called Sino-centrism, which did not diminish in the early twentieth century. The Japanese, however, developed a kind of thinking termed pan-Asianism, in which Asia was considered a unity, and Japan, its leader. Because of this difference, the similarities between Chinese art and Japanese art in the early twentieth century cannot be interpreted as the emergence of an Asian art because the Chinese did not endorse Japanese pan-Asianism. Li Shutong was one of the first Chinese painters to visit Japan to learn Western-style painting. Gao Jianfu, founder of the Lingnan School, went to Japan to learn painting and returned with the style known as Nihonga a synthesis of traditional Japanese painting and Western-style painting. Chen Shizeng was a traditional painter of the scholar class. He also went to Japan to study. But he studied natural history, not painting. Chen Shizeng was most active during the May Fourth Movement of the late 1910s and early 1920s, when radicals wanted to abandon traditional Chinese culture. They called for a total adoption of Western culture. Although Chen Shizeng was open-minded to Western culture, he chose to defend traditional Chinese literati painting. His translation of Japanese scholar Omura Seigai's essay The Revival of Literati Painting was part of this defense. Chen Shizeng was strongly influenced by his teacher Wu Changshuo (1844--1927). He was inspired also by other great Chinese painters of the past, and he adapted some Western methods that he learned in Japan. However, the Japanese influence in his painting should not be interpreted as his attempt to create an Eastern art in collaboration with Japanese painters.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Maryland,NA,NA,"Art history, History, Chen Shizeng, China, Japan, Literati painting, National pride, Painting, Twentieth century",5,College Park,Maryland,38.996,-76.9337,United States
304604593,"Zhang, Yi",Geschichte der Rezeption der deutschsprachigen Literatur in China: Von den Anfaengen bis zur Gegenwart,Contemporary,"This project discusses the history of the reception of the literature of German-speaking countries in China from the beginning to the present. Against the background of Hans Robert Jauß's theory of reception, I am pursuing the idea that historical and social changes make a significant difference in the reception process of the literature of German-speaking countries in China. It is therefore the purpose of my dissertation to investigate how certain groups of Chinese readers “translated” this literature during various historical periods for Chinese audiences. At the beginning of the 20 th century, western literature, including German literature (e.g. Schiller's Wilhelm Tell which promotes the idea of national independence), was introduced to China by progressive intellectuals with the intention of awakening and liberating China from a national crisis. In the 1920's, a literary magazine, Monthly Short Stories , played a major role in introducing German literature in China. Chinese translations of German literature including Goethe's Die Leiden des jungen Werther, Storm's Immensee and Schnitzler's works evoked not only nationwide reactions among young people, but also gave modern Chinese literature a new impetus with regard to form and content. The reception of German literature was hindered by events such as the war with Japan (1937–1945) and the Civil war (1945–1949). Of interest is nevertheless that in the 1930's and 1940's texts by Jewish writers and by others exiled by the Nazis were translated into Chinese and that these writers found a great amount of sympathy. In the 1950's, after the formation of the P.R. China, the reception of German literature was restricted by severe political decisions, therefore limiting the influence of German literature to texts by authors from the GDR. After the Cultural Revolution, literary works depicting the lives of common people during World War II and Post-War Germany, for example Böll's Erzählungen , were well received. At the same time, texts by authors such as Novalis, Nietzsche, Kafka etc. who had been chastised in the 1950's and 1960's, found acceptance now. In the late 20 th century's new era of political and economic reform in China, the reception of German literature shows a promising future.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Maryland,NA,NA,"Germanic literature, History, Asian literature, China, Deutschsprachigen, Gegenwart, German text, Reception",5,College Park,Maryland,38.996,-76.9337,United States
923776573,"Zhou, Zehao","The anti-Confucian campaign during the Cultural Revolution, August 1966–January 1967",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the attacks on the Three Kong Sites (Confucius Temple, Confucius Mansion, Confucius Cemetery) in Confucius’s birthplace Qufu, Shandong Province at the start of the Cultural Revolution. During the height of the campaign against the Four Olds in August 1966, Qufu’s local Red Guards attempted to raid the Three Kong Sites but failed. In November 1966, Beijing Red Guards came to Qufu and succeeded in attacking the Three Kong Sites and leveling Confucius’s tomb. In January 1967, Qufu peasants thoroughly plundered the Confucius Cemetery for buried treasures. This case study takes into consideration all related participants and circumstances and explores the complicated events that interwove dictatorship with anarchy, physical violence with ideological abuse, party conspiracy with mass mobilization, cultural destruction with revolutionary indoctrination, ideological vandalism with acquisitive vandalism, and state violence with popular violence. This study argues that the violence against the Three Kong Sites was not a typical episode of the campaign against the Four Olds with outside Red Guards as the principal actors but a complex process involving multiple players, intraparty strife, Red Guard factionalism, bureaucratic plight, peasant opportunism, social ecology, and everevolving state-society relations. This study also maintains that Qufu locals’ initial protection of the Three Kong Sites and resistance to the Red Guards were driven more by their bureaucratic obligations and self-interest rather than by their pride in their cultural heritage. Finally, this study introduces the concept of “Qufu exceptionalism,” namely, the unassailability and invulnerability of Confucius’s birthplace throughout Chinese history, and provides the reasons why Qufu exceptionalism ultimately succumbed to the Cultural Revolution.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of Maryland,History,History,"History, Asian Studies, China, Confucianism, Confucius, Cultural Revolution, Four Olds, Red Guards, Violence",5,College Park,Maryland,38.996,-76.9337,United States
304908655,"Zhang, Yi",Lineage and the religious -ritual order in Huizhou in Ming times: A case study of the Cheng's lineage,Contemporary,"This dissertation studies the construction process of the conglomerate lineage of the Chengs in Huizhou prefecture in mid-Ming China. This organization used the rule of decent-line to unite the families bearing the surname of Cheng and maintained the unity by means of genealogies and ancestral halls. The emergence of the conglomerated Cheng lineage bespeaks the emergence of a Neo-Confucian order jointly built by literati-officials and rising merchants in mid-Ming Huizhou. The study analyzes the various elements that made the Cheng lineage and defines these elements in the historical context of Huizhou from the Southern Song to the mid-Ming. Crucial elements include the rise of Cheng Lingxi, a famous warlord in sixth century. Cheng Lingxi was rewarded an official title by the Southern Song dynasty for which he became an authoritative god in early Ming times. Huizhou prefecture assumed increasing importance in Southern Song times because of its proximity to the capital at Lin'an. It became a communication hub for metropolitan Lin'an and the inland areas. Local government in Huizhou was strengthened and elites there entered the political center through civil examinations. Zhu Xi and his version of Neo-Confucianism were also well received there in late Southern Song times when both became orthodox. The Mongolian conquest of China saw new social mobility in Huizhou. A group of new power holders arose because of the new regime's recruitment policy, which emphasized the appointee's class background and ability to collect taxes. The suspension of civil examinations in early Yuan times drove a large number of Confucian office-aspirants to become teachers in rural schools. These literati, however, helped spread Neo-Confucianism more widely than before. By late Yuan times, the new power holders in Huizhou also absorbed Neo-Confucianism and put it into practice in the construction of lineage halls and in the compilation of genealogies. Neo-Confucianism became socialized. The founding of the Ming dynasty influenced Huizhou in two ways. First, powerful families rising from Yuan times were weakened during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns. Consequently, Neo-Confucian social practices local elites supported such as lineage construction became inactive. Second, the Ming pursued a state policy of regulating local cults. Of the many local gods in Huizhou, only Wang Hua and Cheng Lingxi became legitimate gods recognized by the state. As a result, the Shi Zhong ( everlasting loyalty ) Temple worshiping Cheng Lingxi became an official temple in Huizhou. In time, branch Shi Zhong temples appeared in many areas in Huizhou and nearby regions. Mid-Ming times witnessed the rise of Neo-Confucianized merchants in Huizhou. The combined effort of Cheng surnamed merchants and the prestigious scholar-official Cheng Minzheng revived the trend of lineage construction in a recognizable pattern. First, the branch Shi Zhong temples were made to be used as ancestral halls of the Chengs. Then, multi-volume genealogies of enlarged kinships were compiled to form conglomerated lineages. The climax of this lineage-building process was the publication of the Conglomerated Lineage of the Chengs of Huizhou (Xin'an Chengshi tongzong shipu) compiled by Cheng Minzheng in 1482. This work created a constructed lineage but also realized a long cherished social ideal of the Confucian scholar. The local merchants were enthusiastic about such lineage-building activities, because the lineage itself facilitated their commercial enterprises and the building of it lessened the social tension brought about by their pursuit of profit.",2006,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Maryland,NA,NA,"History, China, Deutschsprachigen, Gegenwart, German text, Reception",5,College Park,Maryland,38.996,-76.9337,United States
304206260,"Li, Xiaolin",Women in the Chinese military,Contemporary,"This dissertation provides a sociological analysis of patterns of women's military participation in ancient China (5000 years ago-1840), during the post-Opium War period (1840-1949), and in modern times. It addresses three sociological issues: (1) under what conditions have Chinese women taken part in military operations? (2) Do Chinese women participate in direct combat? (3) Does the military institution facilitate women's social mobility to education, jobs and higher social status? The following questions are also addressed: does Chinese women's military participation go through cycles of expansion and contraction? What are the People's Liberation Army (PLA) women's evaluations of their military lives? The study scrutinized 717 Chinese military women from the secondary sources and 230 PLA women through a survey conducted in Beijing in 1992. Women participate in Chinese conventional and unconventional warfare across time. From the first female general, Fu Hao, who lived about 3200 years ago, to the 12 women generals who serve in the PLA today, women's frequent presence has been observed in both regular and irregular military formations. Chinese women participated in direct combat--50% in this study with a 12% combat casualty. Female guerrilla fighters suffered the heaviest, but no casualty of women has been recorded since 1949. Sixteen percent of these women commanded battles. Seventeen percent ranked major and above, 3.5% of them became national leaders. Most women warriors are of the Han nationality. Nearly half of the ancient and the PLA women were from official and officers' families. Cultural and ideological support for women's military participation has also been frequent. Military service is one of the social mobility channels which allow women to achieve or hope for social recognition or higher status. The scope of women's military participation goes in cycles of expansion and contraction, particularly affected by group security situation and shortage of manpower. Women's representation in regular military formations has been increased. Modern military women in mainland China and Taiwan are career makers. Most PLA women did not expect combat participation nor becoming a woman general.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Maryland,NA,NA,"Social structure, History, Womens studies, China, Taiwan",5,College Park,Maryland,38.996,-76.9337,United States
303973291,"Chang, Chun Chig Jim",The Nine-Year Compulsory Education Policy and the development of human resources in Taiwan (1950-1990),Contemporary,"Taiwan's postwar economic progress has clearly been exceptional. The evidence is overwhelming that rapid educational development played an important role in the rapid economic growth achieved, and that the Nine-Year Compulsory Education Policy (NYCEP) enacted in 1968 was the most important policy in creating and promoting the rapid educational development of Taiwan's labor force. The NYCEP changed the period of compulsory education from six to nine years, and vastly increased the resources available to Taiwan's education sector. This dissertation studies the impacts of Taiwan's educational reform by focussing on a variety of questions: (1) What is the impact of the NYCEP on workers' earnings? (2) Have the impacts been different for females than for males? (3) What are the social rates of return to various levels of education? (4) What is the effect of the NYCEP on mean years of schooling over time? (5) Is NYCEP associated with an improvement in the equality of educational attainments? and (6) Is there any measurable impact of the educational reforms on students' health? The questions are addressed by descriptive and econometric analyses of various data sources, mostly labor force surveys over the period 1978 to 1989. Some representative results include: (1) Workers with higher education have higher salaries than workers with less education. Since NYCEP raised the average educational attainments of younger workers, it enabled these workers to acquire more highly paid jobs. (2) The effects of NYCEP, while strong for males, was even stronger for females. (3) The social rate of return to education in Taiwan is higher than for other developing countries. (4) By 1988, NYCEP is estimated to have increased the average educational attainment of workers by 2.86 years for males and 4.27 years for females, relative to projected trends. (5) NYCEP led to a more equal distribution of educational attainments in Taiwan. (6) While NYCEP appears to have had a positive effect on students' health, these results are not statistically significant.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,University of Maryland Baltimore,NA,NA,"Labor economics, History, Social structure, School administration, China, compulsory education, education policy",2,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States
304486428,"Huang, Yi-Ping",The parting of the way: Three generations of ch'in performance practice,Ancient,"For thousands of years and a myriad of generations, the cultivation of the ch'in (a seven-stringed zither) entailed the mastery of not only the physical and physiological aspects of music, but also its ideology, its Tao or Way. Today, many continue to consider that the way of the ch'in epitomizes the reality of the Chinese elite tradition. and the music of the ch'in encapsulates the sound of true antiquity. However, the unprecedented socio-cultural transformations that occurred during the course of the twentieth century have substantially affected the ecology of ch'in practitioners, their attitudes and approaches to music, and their performances. Drawing upon literary documents, interviews, surveys, recordings, analysis with aid of modern technology, and my own observations and experiences as a native ch'in practitioner, this dissertation documents ideological, contextual and stylistic transformations of ch'in performance practice over a span of three generations. Part One seeks to identify primary models of thought through the abstraction of principles advocated in the Ch'in Tao and expressed in observable phenomena and behavior. Part Two diachronically accounts for the unique postwar Taiwan experience with the ch'in tradition, and discusses major cultural processes and the mutual influences between music development and social, political and economic conditions of the time. I have also include a discussion of the development of the ch'in in the Chinese Mainland during the same time period to provide a comparative view. Part Three further explores continuities and changes in attitudes and approaches toward the way of the ch'in and documents synchronies and discrepancies in performance practice among the three generations. Chapter VI focus on schools and repertoire that are most relevant to current practice. while Chapter VII analyzes and compares temporal, dynamic, and ornamental expressions. This analysis demonstrates that contextual and ideological transformations are mirrored by substantial stylistic changes over the course of three generations. The observed dramatic tendencies and increasingly romanticized style of the later generations can be seen as both a reaction and response to the extensive socio-cultural changes, and are embodiments of a complex and continual transformation from a more holistic to a more formal musicological approach toward the way of the ch'in.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Maryland Baltimore,NA,NA,"Music, History, China, Tao, music, zither",2,Baltimore,Maryland,39.3051,-76.6144,United States

Gamble (1890-1968) was a social scientist, religious reformer, photographer and Christian humanist who devoted his life to the study of Chinese urban and rural society. Gamble made four sojourns to China between 1908 and 1932. He served as research secretary for the Beijing YMCA and the Mass Education Movement at Dingxian. As a volunteer member of Princeton-in-Peking, he conducted major social-economic surveys of urban and rural north China, helped establish community service programs in Beijing, and pioneered in the teaching of sociology and social work in China. During his tenure, Gamble also used his camera to build up a visual archive of 5,000 black-and-white photographs which successfully captured the images of China during those critical years in its history. Through Gamble's life and work, the dissertation looks into the institutional history of the Princeton University center in China from 1906 to 1949, during which time its chief work was first to organize and operate the YMCA and then to run the Princeton School of Public Affairs at Yenching University. This study also seeks to analyze how Princeton-in-Peking, under the influence of both the Social Gospelers and institutional economists at home and the forces of reform and revolution in late Qing and early Republican China, shifted the focus of its efforts first to community service and social work and later to higher education in the social sciences. For the first time in the history of Christianity in China, Association work in Beijing demonstrated to the officialdom and the upper classes of the new Republic, that Christianity and the Chinese culture might not be incompatible. The motto of the May Fourth Movement, To save China through science and democracy, and the missionary ideal of Saving China through Christianity for a time seemed to be united under the common goal of social uplift and reconstruction for the new Republic.

304993657,"Hu, Wanli",Mao's American strategy and the Korean War,Contemporary,"Even though the Korean War has been labeled by some as a forgotten war, scholars continue to seek the root of the Sino-U.S. confrontation and Mao's decision to enter the war in Korea. Among the five interpretations I examined, Steven Goldstein compares Mao's intervention to a Greek tragedy. In my opinion, this comes closest to explaining this historical puzzle. However, this interpretation has been largely overlooked by scholarship in the field. My dissertation relies on an understanding of “Mao's American strategy” to comprehend Mao's motivation to enter the war. Mao developed his American strategy in late 1944 and by mid-1945 it was established as the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) approach to the United States. The CCP's concept of the United States was based on its analysis of Washington's long-term strategic interests in China after World War II. Washington's strategic objective was to insure its influence on China through a pro-America government. The best means to reach this objective was to establish a coalition government, which would follow America's multi-party democratic system. Considering its obvious weakness at that time, the CCP leadership welcomed a coalition government in which the CCP and the Guomindang (GMD), could enjoy equal power. However, after analysis of GMD-CCP relations, Mao reached the conclusion that Jiang would not abandon autocracy no matter how hard Washington pressed him. Therefore, a GMD-CCP clash was inevitable. The United States took the position that it had no choice but to stand on the side of the GMD and to interfere with the Chinese revolution sooner or later. Truman's blockade of the Taiwan Straits, and the United Nations troops' crossing the 38 th parallel and marching toward the Yalu in 1950 triggered Mao's intervention. To meet an unavoidable clash, Mao decided to dispatch his army to Korea. In addition to explaining Mao's American strategy, I introduce an international factor: the clash between the National Independence Movement and the constraints of the Cold War. With Mao's American strategy as a chronological line and the international factor as a horizontal circumstance, this dissertation asserts that Mao's involvement in the Korean War can be seen as inevitable—a Greek tragedy.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of Massachusetts Amherst,NA,NA,"History, History, International law, International relations, American strategy, China, Korean War, Mao Zedong, United States-China",2,Amherst,Massachusetts,42.36723,-72.51852,United States
288460385,"Cheng, Wen-chien","Images of happy farmers in Song China (960–1279): Drunks, politics, and social identity",Medieval,"This dissertation investigates a genre of paintings depicting farmers' celebrations and entertainments. Much of the study focuses on how these paintings were “read” by two major groups, the imperial household and non-aristocratic scholar-elites, who comprised their primary patrons and audiences. I argue that these viewers were engaged in a process of deploying a variety of social and political discourses in viewing the images of happy farmers. The discourses include political debates concerning farmers' and the state's welfare, discursive issues on the legitimacy of cultural and political authority, and ideas on the conflation of social and political identities belonging to rural figures and scholar-elites. Chapter One begins with an exploration of the close relationships among the idea of fengsu (local customs), its political connotations, and paintings of village themes. A study of the patronage for these paintings is also attempted in order to provide a basic explanation of the production and consumption of the paintings. Chapter Two examines the village festival theme's close association with literature. I demonstrate that Song scholars' active engagement in making public commentaries on the paintings led to a sympathetic reinterpretation of these rural images. Negative or propagandist readings of happy farmer paintings, which were imposed by the imperial household, were challenged and altered. Chapter Three looks into the specific social and political conditions related to farmers during the Song period. I examine how conflicting political parties could use the subject of farmers differently, as a symbol of state prosperity or a peaceful regime, in order to argue for their own legitimacy or to advocate different policies. The last two chapters look at the rural festival paintings from a new angle—that of scholars' writings about their social identity. I interpret that the conflation of a drunken villager with a scholar-recluse image as is associated with concepts of spontaneity, liberation, and anti-social mannerism. Finally, I investigate the political reasons behind the literati's choice to represent themselves in this manner.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"American history, History, China, Drunks, Farmers, Genre painting, Social identity, Song dynasty",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States

Focus has been placed on the historical commentaries and the narratives to which they pertain, as well as on Ssu-ma Kuang's essays on history and philosophy in order to understand the multi-level intricacies of his historical meaning. The event which begins the history, the division of the state of Chin in 403 B.C., signifies for Ssu-ma Kuang the loss of the tao, the ideal system of ritual and hierarchy as practiced in the Chou. Throughout the long history Ssu-ma Kuang carefully records and analyzes the occasional reappearance of the tao as embodied in various historical characters who are meant to serve as models for future readers. For Ssu-ma Kuang the tao is both a continuous, single standard as well as a flexible entity with potential for change through various concrete performances. This flexibility in his concept of the tao reflects Ssu-ma Kuang's optimistic encouragement for readers at all levels of the hierarchy to perfect their moral inner self and express it in concrete historical actions.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Ancient civilizations, Philosophy, Asian literature, History, China",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304201152,"Burnett, Katharine Persis",The landscapes of Wu Bin (c. 1543-c. 1626) and a seventeenth-century discourse of originality,Modern,"Through reassessment of biographical information, this study finds that Wu Bin (c. 1543-c. 1626) served as a low-level scholar-official whose talents as a calligrapher, painter, and poet brought him to the attention of the emperor and the most influential intellectuals of his period. These intellectuals shared a critical vocabulary with the Gong'an theorists, a group whose ideas in turn drew upon the thought of Neo-Confucianists Wang Yangming and Li Zhi, particularly as regards issues of authenticity and originality. These issues emerge as primary concerns of seventeenth-century literary and art critics, for whom the key term in the discourse of originality was qi. Qi, a term of wide semantic range including strange, extraordinary, and unusual, is used in late Ming literary and art criticism to indicate issues of originality. This thesis provides a history of the term in critical literature. The usage of the term is examined in art criticism as well, and compared with other art critical terms to further distinguish its meaning, application, and nuances. As a participating and respected member of this group of intellectuals, Wu Bin addressed this shared concern in his paintings and inscriptions, giving visual form to a highly-charged critical concept. Examination of Wu's stylistic development provides a case study of late Ming shifts in artistic values as his paintings evolve from embracing the normative tradition in his formative years, to a radical expression of personal uniqueness at the end.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Art History, Asian literature, History, Biographies, China, seventeenth century",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
276324378,"Hammers, Roslyn Lee",The production of good government: Images of agrarian labor in Southern Song (1127–1279) and Yuan (1272/79–1368) China,Medieval,"This dissertation examines the changing face of labor during the Song and Yuan dynasties in relation to the development of a new theme in painting known as Gengzhi tu “Pictures of Tilling and Weaving”. Lou Shu (1090–1162), a court official during the reign of Emperor Gaozong (1127–1162), designed the Pictures of Tilling and Weaving , in which male citizens grow grain in a step-by-step sequence in one scroll, and female citizens produce silk and weave silk fabric in the other. Current scholarship tends to see Pictures of Tilling and Weaving as highly informative works, motivated by a didactic need to teach others how to grow rice and to produce silk fabric. I argue that the development of the theme was related to significant changes in the structure of government bureaucracy and ensuing political debates. By showing the introduction of technological advances and by positioning the farmers within self-sufficient communities, Lou Shu made an innovative shift in the iconography of labor. To accompany each step in both scrolls, he wrote an accompanying poem that in effect challenged the government's right to taxes. The Pictures of Tilling and Weaving are part of a larger category of painting called “ fengsu hua ,” a phrase typically translated as “genre painting.” This conveys the general idea of the Chinese phrase, but it fails to capture all its nuances. Lou Shu's poems and later Southern Song documents on the Pictures of Tilling and Weaving attest to the political component of labor painting, specifically evoking associations of the common people and their role in validating government policy. In order to comment on the changing political circumstances of the Southern Song and Yuan dynasties, the content and format of the Pictures of Tilling and Weaving were ideologically altered. They were reformulated as academic court paintings, as carvings on public stelae, and as woodblock prints in an agricultural treatise disseminated to the reading public.

304607232,"Bentley, Tamara Heimarck","Authenticity in a new key: Chen Hongshou's figurative oeuvre, “authentic emotion,” and the late Ming market",Modern,"This dissertation focuses on the eremitic garden portraits, the romance drama illustrations, and the printed playing cards of Chen Hongshou (1598–1652). It examines his art in relation to two interacting themes: (1)&#xa0.the commodification of late Ming society, and (2)&#xa0.the importance of authenticity ( zhen ) and emotion ( qing ) in late Ming literary theory. In Li Zhi's essay on the “childlike mind” he rails against those who fake their authentic personal feelings. Li sees feeling and political frustration as essential sources of good writing. He also regards companionate male-female relationships as the source of feeling ( qing ) and hence as a basis for other values. Linked to these ideas, both Li Zhi and Yuan Hongdao also invest vernacular literature with a new importance. Chen Hongshou's interest in facial expressions, his individualized characterizations of the bandit-heroes of the Water Margin, his decision to illustrate romance novels and the visual correlation he creates with the lush ci poetry therein, his pictorial adaptation of poses and props from the theater, Chen's prefaces drawing on the wording of Li Zhi, and even his persistent choice of literary models for figurative paintings (Su Shi, Bo Juyi, Tao Yuanming) all reinforce the stress on authenticity, emotion, and direct, vernacularized writing in the essays of Li Zhi and Yuan Hongdao. Chen's Water Margin cards became a forum for expressing political criticism aimed at reforming the late Ming court. After the fall of the Ming, Chen's Venerating Antiquity cards built upon the social critique set up by Wang Daokun's Wanli-era text. In order to barter for his daily needs, Chen Hongshou flattered patrons by painting them as materially disinterested hermits, or by painting for them depictions of renowned scholars like Su Shi. Chen also portrayed himself as a hermit, simultaneously confessing to this own routinized artistic production. The gradual late Ming shift away from personalized barter to less personalized public exchange meant that it was advantageous for an artist to develop an identifiable, idiosyncratic style. Chen Hongshou found himself providing patrons with their desired self-image at the same time that he marketed his own “authentic” persona to an increasingly broad collecting public.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Authenticity, Chen Hongshou, China, Ming, Painting",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304025356,"Lai, Chuhui Judy",The Han representation of exemplary women: Context and interpretation,Ancient,"This dissertation investigates the function of visual images of exemplary and counter-exemplary women depicted in Latter Han stone shrines in the Jiaxiang area. In the early Chinese tradition, women were associated, among other things, with leisure, luxury and illicit intrigue because of their role in court life. But the concept of women and womanly virtue acquired a new rhetorical meaning in the political discourse of local Han scholars. It was a common custom for Han scholars to criticize government policy in their writings by alluding to figures from the classics, both men and women. The designers of the shrines discussed used classical allusions to evoke contemporary political problems, but utilized images instead of words. Images of exemplary and counter-exemplary women could function rhetorically in three areas of political discourse, namely, with respect to issues of personal integrity, issues of political legitimacy, and issues of public service under a corrupt regime. Exemplary women were cited not only in reference to feminine morality, but also in reference to issues of integrity pertinent to men engaged in public service. The examples of both good and evil royal consorts were used to criticize illegitimate court power and nepotism. The depiction of evil royal consorts and the use of images of women as symbols of sexual and political contamination evidently continued the traditional association of women with illicit intrigue. now, however, women also appeared in the discourse of political legitimacy and public service.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Womens studies, China, women",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
305308967,"Elstein, David",Friend or father? Competing visions of master -student relations in early China,Ancient,"My dissertation re-examines long-held assumptions about the nature of the master-student relationship in early China, focusing on one exemplary master, Kongzi (Confucius) and his students. The standard picture holds that the master-student relationship was always hierarchical and demanded strict obedience from the student. In the first part, I examine representations of Kongzi and his disciples in several early texts: the Analects, sections of the Record of Rites ( Liji ), and the Garden of Sayings ( Shuoyuan ). The Analects depicts Kongzi accepting and encouraging student questioning and disagreement. In other texts he is a sage and has perfect understanding. His students seldom disagree with him and never have the knowledge to correct him. However, it is likely that the Record of Rites and Garden of Sayings depict Kongzi this way because they want to show that he is infallible, not because he is a model for masters in general. Having his students correct him would show that he was not a perfect sage, so for hagiographic reasons the relationship became more deferential. In the second part, I look at the chapters on masters and students in the Spring and Autumn of Mr. Lü ( Lüshi chunqiu ) and the biographies of teachers and students in the Han shu. These sources also show that complete obedience was not demanded or expected. Masters had to treat their students properly and students had the option of changing teachers, showing more freedom in the relationship than previously thought. In short, there were several competing paradigms in the early period, and hierarchy was not always a point of emphasis. On the contrary, students often disagreed with their masters and offer their own opinions. My dissertation demonstrates that the proper master-student relationship was a matter of debate.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Education history, History, Religious history, China, Confucius, Disciples, Master-student relations",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304853317,"Park, Jong Phil",Ensnaring the public eye: Painting manuals of late Ming China (1550–1644) and the negotiation of taste,Modern,"Sometime before 1579, Zhou Lüjing (1542–1633), a professional writer living in a bustling commercial town in southeastern China, published a series of lavishly illustrated books entitled Huilin and Huasou , which constituted the first multi-genre painting manuals in Chinese history. Their popularity was immediate and their contents and format were widely reprinted and disseminated in a number of contemporary painting manuals. As a special commodity of early modern China, when people's cultural standing was measured by their command of literati taste and lore, Huilin and other painting manuals provided a growing reading public with a device (or simply the illusion of such) for enhancing social capital. Focusing on Zhou's painting manuals, this dissertation will describe how such publications accommodated the cultural taste and demands of the general public. in other words, I will point to how painting manuals functioned as a form in which everything from icons of popular culture to graphic or literary cliché was presented to both gratify and shape the sensibilities of a growing reading public. The manuals accomplish this in three ways: through the selection of visual motifs, the manipulation of pictorial styles, and through written guides to artistic choice. As a result, many features of Huilin and other painting manuals do not correspond to late Ming artistic practice and knowledge as described by contemporary critics and accounts of the lives of major artists. Staking out the cultural high ground, leading critics and master painters of the time criticized these manuals as suitable only to philistine tastes. They even claimed that the program registered in these manuals was harmful to true artists who aspired to innovation and authenticity in their painting. They promoted instead a new cultural paradigm emphasizing originality in art and literature, which, I argue, was triggered by the very popularity of painting manuals among late Ming public. Such disjunctures in artistic taste underscore how the production and consumption of painting manuals intertwined with the taste-making mechanisms that affected both low- and high-brow consumers in early modern China.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Art history, China, Ming dynasty, Negotiation, Painting manuals, Taste",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
849306935,"Liu, Gang",The poetics of miscellaneousness: The literary design of Liu Yiqing's “Qiantang Yishi” and the historiography of the Southern Song,Medieval,"In spite of its importance in the study of Song (960-1279) literature and historiography, the value of biji (notebooks) has not yet been fully explored. Much existing scholarship on Song history and literature has made use of biji as a source of information. But little has been done to examine how the special literariness of the genre of biji may enhance or even alter our conception of the past. Focusing on the literary design of a 13 th -14 th century Chinese biji titled Qiantang yishi (Anecdotes of Qiantang), this dissertation explores how the perpetual dialectic between the text's miscellaneous surface and internal coherence enriches our understanding of Song history and historiography. Believed to have been written/compiled by a Southern Song (1127-1279) loyalist Liu Yiqing (fl. late 13 th - early 14 th century), Qiantang yishi chronicles the political, military, and cultural reasons behind the fall of the dynasty. While the text's miscellaneous appearance may make it look like nothing more than a simple collection of historical material, what this miscellaneousness actually embodies is a special type of poetics, used by Liu Yiqing to articulate his literary conception, historical vision, and loyalist concerns of the past. It is in its miscellaneousness that the text reveals its very structure and order. But at the same time, this miscellaneousness also destabilizes the text's meaning, and opens the text to different possibilities of reading. This dissertation starts with a brief introduction of the literary features, historical development, and scholarly studies of the genre of biji. It then proceeds to Chapter One to examine the historical, cultural, and literary contexts, in which and through which the making and reading of Qiantang yishi become possible. Chapter Two provides a formal analysis of one of the most distinct literary features of the text, namely, its formless form. Chapter Three contains a comprehensive thematic study of the text, and compares the text to a symphony of discordance that invites different interpretations. The last chapter focuses on the poems in the text, which serve as the poetic eyes that enable us to both look into as well as to look beyond the text.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Biji, China, Liu, Yiqing, Notebooks, Qiantang Yishi, Southern Song dynasty",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
250197580,"Fryslie, Matthew Ernest",The historian's castrated slave: The textual eunuch and the creation of historical identity in the “Ming history”,Modern,"This dissertation looks at the figure of the eunuch in the Mingshi , the official history of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), to see how it was explained and used in that historical text. Through the analysis of the biographies of infamous eunuchs such as Wei Zhongxian (1568–1627) and Liu Jin (d. 1510), as well as those of lesser eunuchs and collaborators, it is shown that the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) historians understood the eunuch's castration to result in his divorce from familial and cultural forms of affiliation and identity. The eunuch's resulting exile from the affiliative order manifests itself not just in the violation of Confucian norms of filial piety and loyalty, but also in a specific form of corporality characterized, and perhaps produced, by the eunuch's freedom from the structuring containment of affiliative identity. This unbridled corporality and release from the restrictions of patriarchal affiliation is confined and manipulated by the historian. Confinement is enacted in the casting of the eunuch as a sterile usurper bringing chaos to the state, yet unable to escape the detached, judgmental gaze of the historian. The historian uses him to police the boundaries of legitimate membership in the class of shi, or literati-officials, by discovering, through contact with him, a similar disaffiliation among his non-eunuch allies. The inflexibility of the judgment against the eunuch and his faction facilitates the Confucian historian in drafting of judgments On such incidents as the Yongle usurpation (1402), the Tumu incident (1449), the Great Rites Controversy of the Jiajing reign (1522–66), and the factional disputes of the Wanli period (1573–1620). However, the eunuch also exceeds his allotted role and questions the constructions and legitimacy of shi affiliation both by parodying those structures of identity and by acting out the unspeakable pleasures of disaffiliation. In doing so, the eunuch deconstructs the notion of legitimate affiliation while revealing the role of desire in the historian's own retrospective/reconstructive gaze over the history he records and identity he wishes to manufacture.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Comparative literature, Castration, China, Eunuch, Historical identity, Ming dynasty",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304520939,"Notar, Beth Ellen","Wild histories: Popular culture, place and the past in southwest China",Contemporary,"Media representations increasingly dominate our world by shaping identities and interests. This dissertation analyzes the ongoing relationship between transnational, national and local representations of the people and past of Dali, Yunnan, a Bai and Muslim minority region of southwest China. Although Dali is a small, borderland place in the Himalayan foothills, it has figured prominently in Chinese popular culture. Employing both media analysis and participant observation, this study suggests that we can achieve a more complete understanding of the relationship between power, inequality and identity by examining representations in practice. Groups and individuals formulate, appropriate and negotiate representations of people, place, and the past as they seek to claim identities and control resources. An examination of five types of representation—(1)&#xa0.historical texts. (2)&#xa0.a film. (3)&#xa0.a novel. (4)&#xa0.a museum. and (5)&#xa0.a pilgrimage festival—reveal marked differences in portrayals of Dali's people and past. Textual emphasis on similarity to or difference from a generalized “Chinese culture” reflects overarching political agendas, which Bai intellectuals and villagers must negotiate. A 1959 film illustrates that during the revolutionary era Bai minority villagers served as role models of socialist modernity and women's liberation. In the current reform era developers use the film, along with a Hong Kong martial arts novel, to market Dali as an exotic tourist destination to over half a million national and transnational tourists each year. While tourism provides short-term employment, it threatens long-term displacement as homes and land disappear under hotels, highways and airports. Dali villagers use their own popular culture, in particular a pilgrimage festival, to illustrate that their history is integrally tied to the land itself. Displacement from the land means a displacement from their history. While Dali fits a growing global pattern of tourism development and displacement, it demonstrates that minority peoples also subvert external models of “rational” development. Finally the study examines why Chinese popular culture has focused on Dali's Bai minority to the exclusion of Muslim history and culture.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, Motion Pictures, Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, China, Cinema, Dali, Historiography, Jin yong, Popular culture, Tourism",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States

Theorizing the processes involved as ones of “musical translation,” this dissertation analyzes how the Chinese “musical hosts” asserted their cultural values and political agendas in their understanding and adoption of Western musical theories and practices. Chapter 1 introduces Shanghai, and the sources and methodology of the dissertation. Chapter 2 explains the concepts of musical translation and modernity. Chapter 3 re-constructs the musical world of Shanghai, tracing how Chinese musical translations emerged from the modernizing city where Chinese had unprecedented contacts with Westerners in semi-colonial conditions. The complex musical network of Shanghai cut across colonial boundaries, shaping participants' translated and modern practices. Chapter 4 traces how the intellectual and musical lives of major participants were tied to the socio-political network of Shanghai. Chapter 5 examines the ways in which Chinese intellectuals and musicians negotiated translated musical knowledge, including the discourses of technology, Chinese history, morality, and national essence. Through these discourses, Chinese projected their national needs and values on the Western music theories and practices they “hosted.” Chapter 6 examines five modern Chinese musical compositions as cases of translational creativity, demonstrating their different translational levels and aspects. The five cases include a Chinese art song composed by Yuen Ren Chao, an erhu solo work composed by Liu Tianhua, a Chinese piano piece composed by He Luting, a sizhu ensemble piece arranged by Liu Raozhang, and a new Peking Opera play performed by Mei Lanfang.

304928641,"Chao, Hui-Hsuan",Musical Taiwan under Japanese colonial rule: A historical and ethnomusicological interpretation,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines Taiwanese musical experience and musical life in the early Japanese colonial period, beginning in 1895, to understand how the Japanese and the Taiwanese negotiated their historically imposed roles through music. When Japan colonized Taiwan, Japanese colonizers faced the problem of how to establish governance on the newly acquired territory, while the Taiwanese confronted the uncertain future of becoming the colonized. The decade following the colonial annexation, 1895-1905, was a transitional period when both Taiwanese and Japanese negotiated new historical experiences and cultural agendas. Music was an essential part of their encounter. This dissertation applies the theoretical concept of musiking—the manipulation of sonic and non-sonic objects of music in musically particularized sites and with musically strategic and driven processes to negotiate specific agendas with targeted partners—to analyze Taiwan musical experiences in the early Japanese colonial period. The Japanese colonizers and the Taiwanese colonized subjects presented and manipulated musical works and performances (objects) in several major venues and occasions (sites) in order to negotiate their concerns and agendas (processes). Such a portrait of colonial Taiwan thus addresses the dynamic interactions between the foreign colonizing power and the local colonized population through musical activities. By analyzing how Japanese and Taiwanese musiked together for their own agendas in the early colonial period, this dissertation argues that the emerging new and hybridized soundscape of colonial Taiwan, comprised of a diversity of musics and cultures, set the foundation for the development of the modern and complex musical Taiwan in the twentieth century.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, Music, China, Colonial, Colonialism and music, Ethnomusicological, Japanese, Japanese colonialism, Music and modernity, Music and politics, Musicking, Taiwan, Taiwan--Colonial period",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States

For the era of Reform and Opening, I describe how activists were able to challenge the authoritarian rule of the state while many urban Chinese tended to acquiesce, in particular after 1989. I also show how activists have successfully resisted the trends toward an apolitical life mired in commercialization and consumption by finding collective meaning in religious faith.

This dissertation redresses these problems by defining a zone termed “Northern Mainland Southeast Asia” encompassing southern Yunnan, northeast India, and northern parts of mainland Southeast Asia and by focusing on Ming-Southeast Asian overland interactions. Utilizing a large number of primary sources in Chinese, Vietnamese, Tai, and Burmese, it examines the transfer of military technology from Ming China to Southeast Asia, Ming China's political expansion, overland trade, and the migration of Han Chinese into Northern Mainland Southeast Asia. It argues that the overland stimuli, especially military technology and trade, from Ming China contributed to the emergence of Northern Mainland Southeast Asia between the 1430s and 1530s, which was epitomized in the rise of the Maw Shans, the decisive defeat of Champa by Dai Viet, Dai Viet's long march as far as the Irrawaddy River, the prosperity and military strength of Lan Na, the rise of Mongmit and Mohnyin and the sack of Ava by Mohnyin, and the expansion of the Ahoms. However, after the arrival of European military technology via the maritime route after the early sixteenth century, the tables were turned. Southern Mainland Southeast Asia, as represented by Burma (Myanmar), started its northward and eastward expansion at the expense of Northern Mainland Southeast Asia. Without denying internal dynamics, this dissertation demonstrates that the shift of external stimuli, in particular military technology, changed the orientation of mainland Southeast Asian history and Sino-Southeast Asian overland interactions.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Economic history, History, China, India, Military, Ming, Myanmar, Trade",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
251087294,"Swope, Kenneth Michael, Jr.","The three Great Campaigns of the Wanli Emperor, 1592–1600: Court, military, and society in late sixteenth-century China",Modern,"This dissertation looks at the political environment of late Ming China as viewed through the prism of a series of military campaigns conducted in the 1590s against both foreign and domestic foes. The long reign of the Wanli Emperor (r.1573–1620) was a critical period in Ming (1368–1644) history as the dynasty enjoyed a brief revival of fiscal solvency and military strength before descending into the final stages of decline. While the latter half of Wanli's reign has received a good deal of attention in the scholarly literature, the earlier period of achievements under Wanli, especially with regards to military affairs, has been glossed over by modern scholars. I correct this shortcoming by examining a large number of little used primary sources to paint a new picture of the late Ming military and the social and institutional contexts in which it operated. My project focuses on the Three Great Punitive Campaigns of the Wanli Emperor ( Wanli san da zheng ) which took place in rapid succession in three vastly different frontier regions. While these campaigns are well known to scholars, scant attention has been paid to the rich primary sources which discuss them. These source materials include eyewitness accounts, diaries, memorials to the throne, letters between officials, dispatches from the battlefield, and imperial decrees. In my dissertation I challenge conventional wisdom about the late Ming military as well as describe it in enough detail to be of use to comparative and world historians. Furthermore, the dissertation attempts to stimulate discussion on such important topics as ethnic relations, the role of tributary states in the Chinese world order, and the status of military elites in late imperial Chinese society.

305301986,"Harter, Seth M.","Time is moving forward, but we are moving faster: Racing towards modernity in Hong Kong and Guangdong, 1945–1962",Contemporary,"The retrocession of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997 posed the question of convergence: how would Hong Kong integrate with the neighboring province of Guangdong? Conventional wisdom held that the two were radically different from one another in 1997, and that the origins of that difference lay in their mutual isolation between 1950 and 1976. In this dissertation, by examining the connections between the two regions at the supposed onset of this isolation, I advance three arguments: first, that while Hong Kong and Guangdong may have been very different, that difference was founded on an enduring relationship of material interdependence. second, that the nature of this material interdependence was obscured on both sides by discursive claims of independence. and third, that these discursive claims were themselves a form of interdependence. After using migration and trade statistics to demonstrate the material interdependence of the two protagonists, I then consider the political utility that each side saw in denying this interdependence. Using the radically dichotomizing discourse theorized by Ernesto Laclau, each territory started with a master trope, and then constructed a stack of labels which it applied to the other. In the 1950s, then, Guangdong saw Hong Kong as colonial=exploitative=class stratified=dehumanizing. Hong Kong, meanwhile, saw Guangdong as socialist=planned=unfree=poor. Each side thus intended to legitimate its own government and impugn its rival. However different the labels they employed, their capacity to share in this discursive rivalry revealed a common subscription to the principles of modernism, expressed in the language of time and progress. Thus, in the 1950s, Hong Kong viewed Guangdong as its economic past: an underdeveloped hinterland of cottage industries and agriculture. Guangdong, meanwhile, looked on Hong Kong as its political past: a territory oppressed by colonialism. The body of the dissertation examines the evolution of this rivalry through a series of problems the two regions faced as they tried to develop isomorphism: the alignment of the populations resident in, citizens of, and loyal to, a state. Using case studies of migration, border control, resettlement and remittances, the dissertation charts the influence that each region had on its neighbor.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, China, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Housing, Immigration, Modernity",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304466877,"Skaff, Jonathan Karam",Straddling steppe and sown: Tang China's relations with the nomads of Inner Asia (640-756),Medieval,"From the founding of imperial China in 221 B.C.E. until the eighteenth century the nomadic peoples of Inner Asia posed the strongest challenge to regimes in China. The Tang dynasty (618-907) developed effective policies to handle these competitors during the first half of its rule. Some scholars have proposed that by adopting strategies of appeasement Chinese dynasties normally encouraged the growth of parasitic nomadic confederations. This was not the case in the first half of the Tang. Using a mixture of accommodational, coercive, and defensive strategies, the Tang kept nomads relatively divided and weak. The Tang's policies were effective because they broke the cultural boundaries conventionally assumed to exist between Inner Asia and China. This was possible because a multi-ethnic society and hybrid political culture had developed in North China after nomadic conquests in the preceding centuries. Politically, the dynasty created a new ideology of the Heavenly Qaghan that Tang emperors used to compete with Inner Asian chiefs for the loyalty of nomads. By offering rewards, protection, marriages, and trade, the Tang rulers won over nomadic groups and strengthened the dynasty at the expense of competing chiefs on the steppe. When nomads could not be controlled through peaceful means, the Tang relied upon coercive and defensive measures. Diplomacy and subterfuge were utilized to exploit conflicts within hostile tribes or to create alliances to fight against them. In warfare the Tang gained parity with the militarily adept steppe nomads by adopting the light cavalry common in Inner Asia and recruiting skilled Chinese and non-Chinese mounted archers to serve in their forces. The Tang's cavalry was the key to their ability to counterattack against invaders and launch campaigns on the steppe. Although the Tang's hybrid cultural background played a large part in implementing these effective Inner Asian policies, two other factors were important. One was the availability of strong emperors and talented civil and military personnel. The other was centralized control over the entire Chinese heartland, which gave the dynasty the human and material resources necessary to carry out its policies.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, China, Inner Asia, Nomads, Tang Dynasty",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
303943945,"Enatsu, Yoshiki",The rise of the Fengtian local elite at the end of the Qing dynasty,Contemporary,"It is noteworthy that some important figures among the Fengtian local elite at the close of the Qing period were Chinese bannermen. This dissertation investigates the historical background of these Chinese bannermen elite and their rise in the world of Fengtian local politics at the end of the Qing period. In particular, I examine the case of Yuan Jin-kai who was a powerful leader of the Fengtian local elite from the close of the Qing through the Manzhouguo periods. In the early part of the seventeenth century many Ming soldiers, landlords, and peasants who surrendered to the Manchu dynasty for their safety in Liaodong area were organized as Chinese bannermen by the Qing dynasty. Large areas of lands surrendered by the Han landlords to the Manchus were classified as public lands, e.g., manor lands of the Qing court and of its nobles. The former landlords, now Chinese bannermen, were usually allowed to manage these public lands and functioned there as pseudo-landlords. At the beginning of the twentieth century those pseudo-landlords were able to acquire full ownership of the lands they had managed. They obtained ownership by buying land disposed of by the Qing dynasty for financial purposes. After the Russo-Japanese War the Qing dynasty also tried to re-establish its effective control over Manchuria by integrating local power into the provincial administrative system. Leaders of the local elite, including the new landlords of the former public lands, began to participate in provincial politics as members of the Provincial Assembly and of the county assemblies. During the confusion of the 1911 Revolution, the local elite controlled provincial politics in tandem with Qing provincial officials. This was the first step toward realizing the principle that Fengtian natives should govern Fengtian Province. Yuan Jin-kai, a former powerful Chinese bannerman landlord in Liaoyang and Vice Chairman of the Provincial Assembly, was a leader of the Fengtian local elite and, together with Zhao Erxun, the Governor-General of Dongsansheng, played a central role in crushing the anti-Qing movements in Fengtian at the time of the 1911 Revolution.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, China",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304247472,"Lee, Sophia",Education in wartime Beijing: 1937-1945,Contemporary,"This study focuses on a group of public and private schools, from elementary to post-secondary level, in the city of Beijing under Japanese occupation during the second Sino-Japanese war (1937-1945). The schools under discussion define a place where an array of the needs and aspirations of Beijing's wartime society and authorities fused with, collided against, or ignored each other. The occupation generated necessary adjustment to and serious questioning of some prewar notions about education, society, and nation. The occupation also fostered renewed interest in and heightened appreciation of other prewar notions about education, society, and nation. Moreover, the war and occupation did not halt Republican China's ongoing attempt to clarify the purpose and the place of education in a society and nation, both in the throes of redefinition. Findings in this study also illustrate some of the complexities and contradictions long hidden behind a series of familiar but shopworn poses depicting the occupation as a time when omnipotent Japanese, with their Chinese collaborators, viciously oppressed the Chinese masses. Wartime Beijing and Beijing National universities offered bona fide professional training for some and opportunity for others who would not have been academically qualified to attend these institutions in the prewar years. The Japanese imprint on these two wartime campuses was not conspicuous. The war and occupation accentuated the distinctive features of Beijing's two missionary universities, Yanjing and Furen. Each enjoyed increased enrollment, but neither was exactly the island of autonomy portrayed in many postwar accounts. The city's public primary and secondary schools were given the responsibility of teaching youngsters basic skills and proper ethics. Despite repeated government pronouncements about textbook revisions in order to disseminate to young students the new official ideology, analysis shows that the revisions were anything but thoroughgoing. Ending more often in failure than success, the attempts by Beijing's wartime authorities to transform education are not particularly notable, but the rationale and means used to implement these attempts contributed to the more dramatic transformation of Chinese education, society, and nation after 1945.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, Education history, China, World War II",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
762424456,"Zhang, Ying",Politics and morality during the Ming-Qing dynastic transition (1570-1670),Modern,"This study explores the significance of moral issues in shaping literati-officials' political struggles and behaviors during the Ming-Qing dynastic transition (roughly from 1570 to 1670). Focusing on four literati-officials (Li Zhi, Zheng Man, Huang Daozhou, and Gong Dingzi) and women in their lives, it highlights how the Confucian ideal of the literati official was strained during a time of intense factionalism and loyalism, and the ways in which moral discourse about personal behavior was deployed for political purposes. The roles and responsibilities laid out by the Five Cardinal Relations ( wulun ) were utilized by literati-officials during this dynastic transition to define the political virtue of loyalty ( zhong ) in moral attacks as well for self-protection. This work argues that political struggles, by activating intangible connections among literati's multiple moral virtues, made these virtues—in particular gender norms and sexual morality—relevant to politics and officials' career. Through an investigation of the lived reality of particular literati-officials, this study not only demonstrates how moral issues affected political developments but also exposes and challenges the legacy of what it identifies as the grand narrative of the Ming-Qing transition—a moral, political, and historical interpretative framework based on the presumed association between loyalty and morality. This framework shaped the moralistic nature of seventeenth-century literati's historical documentation as well as modern historians' readings of the archive. The methodologies of literary studies, art history, and gender studies are brought to bear in an intertextual examination of a variety of primary sources, including official and non-official histories, court memorials, literati scholarly works, biographies and autobiographies, letters, collections of poetry, artworks, and popular literature. With this range of sources, it is possible to tease out how sensational elements in literary and political rhetoric affected negotiations in court, the symbolism in political language, and the intertwining of the political and emotional dimensions of literati-officials' experience during this time of crisis and transformation.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, Ethics, Political science, Gender studies, China, Confucianism, Five Cardinal Relations, Gender, Literati, Loyalty, Ming-Qing transition, Morality, Politics",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States

Specifically, it focuses attention on the political dimensions of Yongzheng's reforms by grounding his rule in a historically specific narrative that demonstrates the contingent manner in which imperial authority was constituted. One objective of this study is to explore how flexibility is engineered into seemingly rigid political institutions and governing techniques by the selective adaptation of moral standards and pragmatic approaches. Another aim is to create a finely-textured study of the late imperial Chinese bureaucracy in action and to detail the administrative reality that the Yongzheng emperor faced early in his reign. Chapter 1 provides an overview as well as a review of the relevant secondary literature. Chapter 2 describes the daily activities of officials to establish a baseline for bureaucratic functioning that captures the complex relationships between officials, monarch and bureaucrat, and conflicting notions of governance. Chapter 3 traces the eruption of official discord and its escalation into a major crisis that pitted established bureaucratic procedures against imperial prerogative. Chapter 4 examines the implications of the transformation of an instance of discord among colleagues into a broader crisis and scrutinizes the principles behind Yongzheng's approach to handling such administrative quandaries. Chapter 5 charts the reorganization of the provincial bureaucracy under imperial supervision and reconsiders the notion that institutional solutions formed the foundation of many of Yongzheng's reforms.

304084783,"Jacobson, Carl Whitney","Brotherhood and society: The Shaanxi Gelaohui, 1867-1912",Contemporary,"The Gelaohui (The Society of Brothers and Elders) was a Chinese blood brotherhood association descended from the Guolu, early Qing mutual aid bands which emerged among vagrant males in the Sichuan frontier area. While it did not derive from the Tiandihui as has been supposed, it was generated from the same blood brotherhood metaphor. Lacking economic viability, vagrant males were not a part of community, but outside of it. The metaphor arose because of the need for alternative community. By building networks and providing services for gentry and villagers, the blood brotherhood form provided a livelihood. Its ideology reinforced traditional notions of family relations and mutual obligations between older and younger brothers. Thus it was reactive and opportunistic. With the increasing pace of change in the nineteenth century and the resulting dislocations, this form became relevant to an increasing number of people in central China. The Gelaohui, itself, first emerged in full form in the armies assembled to fight the Taiping Rebellion. It was seen as a boost to fighting spirit. Racketeering and the expression of discontent among soldiers were others of its features. With the demobilization of soldiers it spread through the Yangzi Valley. Its 1911 anti-Qing stance emerged only after it had spread. This stance was driven by the development of anti-Qing sentiment among the gentry. The Gelaohui entered Shaanxi Province with the armies assembled by Zuo Zongtang to put down the Muslim Rebellion. After the departure of these armies from Shaanxi in the aftermath of the Rebellion, the Gelaohui engaged in rapacious activities in peripheral regions of the province. In 1900, however, it began to engage in protests such as the destruction of new schools, churches and tax offices. These activities were carried out in core areas. The Gelaohui played a uniquely important role in the 1911 Revolution, including in the massacres of Manchus and Westerners in Xi'an. These and other aspects of the 1911 Revolution analyzed in the thesis reveal that the Gelaohui could not transcend its basically reactive and opportunistic character.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, History, Criminology, China, Revolution of 1911, secret societies",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304518220,"Murdock, Michael Glen","The politics of exclusion: Revolutionary centralization, national identity and Christianity in China during the Nationalist Revolution, 1923–1927",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the competitive relationship between the Chinese Nationalist Party (Guomindang or GMD) and rival systems of social and cultural influence operating in south China between 1924 and 1927, particularly Christian enterprises such as schools, hospitals, and other institutions. Through these establishments, many foreign Christians hoped to direct Chinese development toward a future committed to liberal as well as Christian political and social values. By 1924, this Christian vision, as well as those of non-revolutionary provincialist and localist interests, contended sharply with that of China's Nationalist revolutionaries who sought a strong, centralist version of modern China. Against resistance by rival organizations to its centralization efforts, the GMD employed an effective strategy that involved heavy use of popular activism and simultaneous regime accommodation. By employing mass agitation (which constantly disrupted rival programs) as well as government intervention (which offered assistance to these same rivals if they would accept GMD oversight) competitors such as the Guangzhou Merchants' Corps, British interventionists, various anti-government citizens corps ( mintuan ), and Christian institutions, gradually gave up their opposition and accepted GMD dominance in return for government support against popular agitators. Against Christian institutions, the “dual-pronged” strategy proved remarkably effective at pressuring missionary educators to comply with government regulatory oversight in return for “protection” from anti-Christian agitation. Thus, rather than simply targeting non-revolutionary groups for destruction, the Nationalist movement successfully processed them for “inclusion” in the GMD version of the modern Chinese nation. Although effective as a means of dealing with non-revolutionary rivals, the “dual-pronged” strategy also empowered popular agitating groups which sometimes viewed destructive and confrontational agitative objectives as the desired end of their efforts. Taking propaganda to its logical conclusion and pursuing their own interests, agitating organizations often acquired new agendas for agitating that extended beyond the centralizing objectives of party authorities. During the course of the Northern Expedition in particular, anti-Christian mass-agitation became acutely disruptive, precipitating concern among revolutionary leaders (both left and right wing) about escalating violence and prompting GMD efforts to diffuse and suppress agitation in order to avoid destructive conflict with Christian and foreign institutions.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, Religion, Political science, Centralization, China, Christianity, National identity, Nationalist Revolution",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
305303652,"Snyder-Reinke, Jeffrey P.","Dry spells: Rainmaking, power, and the state in Late Imperial China",Modern,"This dissertation is an investigation of rainmaking activities that were organized or conducted by local officials in late imperial China. This dissertation has two main objectives. First, it seeks to provide a wealth of new data about rainmaking activities that were carried out by Chinese officials. Second, it suggests that this data modifies our understanding of several key issues in the study of Chinese history and religion, such as the content of state orthodoxy, the nature of official religion, and the character of state-society relations. Chapter 1 opens the investigation by providing a brief review of the relevant literature and describing the organization of the study. Chapter 2 gives an overview of official rainmaking by presenting various newspaper accounts of rainmaking activities that took place during three droughts in the Lower Yangzi region in the late nineteenth century. Chapter 3 traces the origins of official rainmaking practices to several rainmaking exemplars in early Chinese history and describes how these exemplars provided the inspiration for an eclectic rainmaking tradition that persisted into the late imperial period. Chapter 4 examines how official rainmaking was treated in the Qing ritual order. It argues that efforts by various actors to systematize rainmaking during this time failed, which led to a general incoherence in the state rainmaking regime. Chapter 5 contends that this incoherence allowed for a wide range of official rainmaking practices to be carried out, practices that this chapter describes in detail. Chapter 6 provides depth to this discussion by describing a rainmaking method that was developed by a Qing magistrate named Ji Dakui and enjoyed immense popularity among officials in the nineteenth century. Chapter 7 explores how official rainmaking was received by local communities. It argues that elites and commoners could shape official rainmaking by persuading or pressuring officials to pray in a way that the community desired. Chapter 8 concludes by exploring the implications of this dissertation for the study of Chinese history and religion more broadly.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, Religious history, Folklore, China, Imperial, Power, Rainmaking, Religion, Ritual",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
305179970,"Nakajima, Chieko","Health, medicine and nation in Shanghai, ca. 1900–1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores various connotations and transformations of the idea of “health” in late 19th and early 20th century Shanghai. By examining the relations between “health,” Shanghai society, and municipal politics, this dissertation discusses how political power expressed through an ideology of health developed in Shanghai, and the hegemony exercised by those who defined it. The study begins with a discussion of Shanghai's health care providers: hospitals and drugstores. In the late 19th century, hospitals were introduced into the city by missionaries. In the 20th century, not only medical missionaries but also the local elite as well as Chinese-style doctors engaged in management of hospitals. Hospitals served multiple purposes, including charity, research, education and business. At the same time, Shanghai's entrepreneurs opened new-style drugstores to sell Chinese-made Western medicine. These entrepreneurs not only introduced Western medicine to Shanghai residents but also incorporated “health” into commercial strategies. The dissertation next examines the public health administration in Shanghai in the early 20th century. While the Nationalist state created nationwide health care systems, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau took charge of health-related work in the city. The Shanghai Health Bureau had its origin in local organizations. As health care became a part of municipal administration, the connotations of “health” also expanded. In early 20th century Shanghai, “health” meant not only personal well-being but also civic order and national strength. This connection of “health,” civic order and the nation is manifested in health campaigns, in which “health” became a political slogan and a subject of mass mobilization activities. A wide range of measures, which evolved from Shanghai's urban culture, was adopted to disseminate the idea of “health.” The dissertation also discusses the coercive dimensions of health-related work. It points out the political power of “health” and science by focusing on wartime cholera control work in the 1940s. The Japanese occupation during the war was accompanied by the desire of the Japanese forces and the puppet government to enforce policies and to control Shanghai society. As “health” based on modern science became a part of wartime politics, health administrators used “health” to enforce regulations and to supervise people's lives.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, Science history, China, Health, Medicine, Nation, Shanghai",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304933623,"Chen, Shuang","Where urban migrants met rural settlers: State categories, social boundaries, and wealth stratification in northeast China, 1815–1913",Contemporary,"In this dissertation, I study the implications for patterns of equality and inequality of a common state practice in Chinese history, the creation of population categories with differentiated entitlement rights, using a well-documented example. In 1815, in response to the fiscal challenge of supporting bannermen, an elite population who depended on state stipends for their livelihoods, the court established a state farm in Shuangcheng in Northeast China, planning to relocate metropolitan bannermen from Beijing there to become farmers. The court also relocated rural bannermen from other parts of Northeast China to Shuangcheng to help the metropolitan bannermen adapt to the rural environment. Eventually, 3,000 rural and 698 metropolitan banner households resettled in the 120 banner villages in Shuangcheng, living off the land allocated by the state. The state divided these official immigrants and other unofficial immigrants to this area into four population categories with differentiated entitlements to land: metropolitan and rural bannermen as the haves and floating bannermen and civilian commoners as the have-nots. I demonstrate the implications for inequality of the interplay of state land allocation policies based on population category and local land acquisition practices by analyzing longitudinal individual-level population data, household-level landholding data, and qualitative documents from central and local archives. The state's land allocation policies maintained inequality between categories and promoted equality within them: metropolitan bannermen had twice as much land as rural bannermen, while floating bannermen and civilian commoners were excluded from land allocation altogether. Despite the persistence of various local practices of land accumulation, transaction, and inheritance, the data demonstrate enduring between-category inequalities and within-category equalities among the majority of the population in Shuangcheng from 1870 to 1912. Moreover, tensions built into the unequal distribution of land transformed administrative categories into distinct social groups that transcended individual and polity. By documenting this instance of the state's creation of population categories through the allocation of land and contextualizing it in Chinese history more broadly, this study shows the salience of within-category equalities and between-category inequalities created by state policy in stratification processes in Chinese society.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, Social structure, China, History, Land distribution, Migrants, Resettlement, Social stratification, State-society relations, Wealth",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304025037,"Buoye, Thomas Michael",Violent disputes over property rights in Guangdong during the Qianlong reign (1736-1795),Modern,"During the eighteenth century, an unprecedented level of population growth in China caused a shift in the relative value of two key factors of production, land and labor, and provided incentives to define and enforce property right in land more strictly. These conditions exacerbated disputes over long-standing property right issues such as boundary and water rights and heightened tensions over issues which were more prevalent in the eighteenth century such as rent defaults, redemptions, and evictions. Efforts to forcefully assert or redefine rights created the potential for disputes, which sometimes became violent. This dissertation examines change over time in the major issues, participants, official disposition, and geographic and temporal distribution of 385 homicides related to disputes over property rights in Guangdong province during the Qianlong reign (1736-1795). The thesis includes an examination of Guangdong's economy during the eighteenth century and the long term trends in the development of property rights in order to establish the broader significance of the disputes. The primary resource materials for the study of disputes are reports of homicides that were forward to the central government in routine memorials to the Ministry of Justice. To illustrate the change over time I rely on a qualitative analysis of the major issues, claims made, and dispute types. initiators of claims, initiators of violence. county locations, date and duration of disputes, names, number, kinship, social and legal status of participants in disputes. evidence of prior efforts at mediation, reporters of disputes, investigating officials, laws invoked, sentencing, and dispositions of claims for 385 disputes. To delineate the broader social and economic environment of eighteenth century Guangdong I rely on contemporary descriptions of eighteenth century Guangdong's economy and society drawn from local histories, Ministry of Revenue documents, and secondary literature in addition to evidence obtained from the homicide reports. The thesis finds that over time homicides related to property right disputes declined. Violence abated as innovations in property rights were incorporated into customary law and, in some cases, belatedly recognized in imperial edicts. The decline in deadly violence also coincided with a shift in economic power in favor of landlords which facilitated a refinement of property rights that benefited land owners and insulated them from disputes. As property rights were defined more clearly and violent disputes declined, the focus of the disputes also changed. Peasants were increasingly forced to compete amongst themselves for a limited supply of land and disputes between competing tenants accounted for a greater share of all violent disputes. Most, but not all of the temporal and geographic variation in the pattern of violent disputes was due to the uneven effects of commercialization and population growth.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"History, Social structure, Economic history, China",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
3580000057,"Respess, Amanda",The Abode of Water: Shipwreck Evidence and the Maritime Circulation of Medicine Between Iran and China in the 9th Through 14th Centuries,Medieval,"This dissertation traces the role of Persian travelers and physicians in the maritime exchange of medical goods and knowledge between Iran and China between the ninth through the fourteenth centuries, and the afterlife of that exchange in modern museums. The Maritime Silk Road was a cosmopolitan network of premodern trade arteries linking the Far East and Southeast Asia to the Middle East by sea. The long-standing cultural and economic exchange across these thoroughfares dramatically expanded the pharmaceutical ingredients and medicinal recipes available to physicians practicing across the littorals of the Indian Ocean and South China Sea and facilitated the intellectual engagement of scholars with medical theories from afar. Drawing from an archive of shipwreck artifacts that includes medical goods, herbs, trade wares, and the personal effects of seafarers interpreted alongside written accounts of sea travel, medical and philosophical texts, tomb inscriptions, and architecture in port cities, this dissertation explores how the maritime journey of Persian travelers to China influenced the epistemology and practice of Persian medicine. The first chapter addresses the current state of Southeast Asian shipwreck archaeology and traces the trajectories of medical, scientific, and related shipwreck and navigational artifacts within Western museum collections. Chapter two introduces the historical context in which Persian merchants moved in Middle Period China and initiates a discussion of hybridity and resilience. The burning and reconstruction of the Hangzhou Phoenix mosque provides the narrative frame in which repeated outbreaks of violence in Tang and Song port cities are discussed as an analog to theories of the body and disease. Migration, hybridization, and medical collecting are examined as social and medical practices of resilience. The chapter uses archaeological evidence from port cities and the Belitung shipwreck with a narrative account of the massacre of foreign merchants in Guangzhou to situate the early maritime migration of Persian merchants to China within the changing tides of the Tang and Song periods. The third chapter analyzes the maritime trade routes as sites of spiritual and physical risk, humoral vulnerability, and initiation by examining Zoroastrian, Buddhist, and Islamic cosmologies of water and migration evident in religious rituals, medical instructions for seafarers, and the personal effects and crew supplies recovered from the Belitung, Intan, Java Sea, and Pulau Buaya wrecks. These materials are interpreted in light of reflections on the maritime life by travelers who survived the journey to China, leaving behind a ninth-century artistic depiction of a shipwreck, a narrative account, and inscriptions on the tombstones of merchants. Chapter four analyzes the medicines and medical material culture recovered from the Beliting, Java Sea, Intan, Pulau Buaya, and Quanzhou wreck sites within the framework of Persian humoral medicine. The final chapter examines the Tansūqnāma, a fourteenth-century Persian translation of Chinese medical texts, in light of the longue durée of medical exchange between China and Iran and changes to social hierarchies throughout the Mongol Empire that drastically changed the position of Persian merchants in China.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,Anthropology and History,Anthropology and History,"Indian Ocean World, Persianate World, Maritime Silk Road, Islam in China and Southeast Asia, Shipwreck archaeology, Persian travelers, Medical history,",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
305180732,"Hayashi, Natsuko","The linkage between domestic and international conflict: The case of Japanese foreign policy, 1890–1941",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the linkage between domestic and international conflict. It considers how domestic political unrest influences the foreign policy decisions of government leaders to begin negotiations and to withhold concessions, as well as decisions to initiate, and subsequently escalate military conflicts. I argue that when domestic political conflicts arise between incumbent leaders and their own political allies, the resulting unrest has a significant impact on leaders' foreign policy decisions. I test my argument by exploring Japanese domestic politics and foreign relations with four rival countries (China, Russia, Great Britain and the United States) for the period between 1890 and 1941. The first significant finding is that there is a “conditional” link between leaders' diversionary behavior abroad and the political conflict they confront at home. Japanese leaders are inclined to pursue confrontational foreign policy choices for domestic political considerations only when they are faced with an erosion of coalition support at home. In other words, only a certain type of domestic political unrest is expected to provide leaders with an incentive to choose aggressive foreign policies for the purpose of offsetting domestic political crises. A second important finding is that aggressive foreign policies that Japanese leaders consider using as diversionary tactics include not only initiatives to threaten or use force against foreign rival states, but also decisions to take a harder line in negotiations as well as to escalate military confrontations. My results show that Japanese leaders who are faced with a loss of coalition support are more likely to take initiatives to threaten or actually use force rather than simply taking diplomatic initiatives for a diversionary effect. In addition, these politically insecure leaders are more likely to withhold concessions in negotiations and more likely to escalate ongoing military conflicts as a way of rallying domestic support for the leadership. These findings are drawn from the estimation of multivariate statistical models that explains variation in Japanese diplomatic and military policies during the pre-WWII period. Case studies are also conducted to illustrate the impact of domestic political unrest on foreign policy actions of Japanese government as suggested by statistical tests.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"International law, International relations, History, China, Domestic conflict, Foreign policy, Great Britain, International conflict, Japanese, Russia, United States",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304607870,"Nakai, Yoshifumi","Politics of state building and economic development in Manchuria, 1931–1936",Contemporary,"In 1931, Japan occupied Manchuria or Northeast China. This major development resulted largely from a conspiracy of Japan's local forces in the region, the Guandong Army. Unwittingly, Japan acquired the responsibility for a territory that was mostly agricultural, with little economic or political infrastructure. What to do with this suddenly acquired territory and its inhabitants became a major issue for the Japanese organizations in Northeast China and ultimately, for the central government in Tokyo as well. From 1931 to 1936, enormous bureaucratic struggles and individual rivalries affected the course of the region's political and economic development. Different visions were articulated concerning the role Northeast China should play in Japan's national security and economic strategy. The three struggling organizations were the South Manchuria Railway Company, the Guandong Army, and the newly installed government of Manchuria, Ishiwara Kanji, Miyazaki Masayoshi, and Hoshino Naoki were the strong willed leaders who fought over the region's future. The alternative visions were to develop Manchuria in its own right, to integrate it into a comprehensive plan for Japan's development, and to turn it into a military-industrial base for use against the USSR. Drawing upon the theoretical literature on organizational behavior, the thesis illuminates the complex political process through which a development plan—the Five Year Plan for the Industrialization of Manchuria—was finally enacted in 1,936, five years after the occupation began. It never was fully implemented, due to the 1937 Japanese invasion of the rest of China.

305311344,"Gardner, Alexander Patten","The twenty-five great sites of Khams: Religious geography, revelation, and nonsectarianism in ninetheenth-century eastern Tibet",Contemporary,"This dissertation is an exploration of a narrative map known as The Twenty-five Great Sites of Khams. The map is a descriptive list of forty-two religious sites in the southwestern Sino-Tibetan borderlands. It was set forth in two separate versions in the second half of the nineteenth century. As an articulation of regional identity, the map projected religious and social values onto the mountainous terrain and established a geographic representation of Khams that included neither political borders nor administrative structure. Chapter One uses the initial version of the narrative map, produced in 1857 by the treasure revealer ( gter ston ) Mchog gyur gling pa (1829-1870), to investigate three interrelated issues: (1)&#xa0.the category of sacred geography, (2)&#xa0.Tibetan strategies of representing space, and (3)&#xa0.the means by which its author used landscape to legitimate himself and his revelations, or treasures ( gter ma , texts or objects said to have been concealed in the soil of Tibet to be discovered when the time was right). Chapter Two examines the normative tropes of treasure revelation narrative and finds that many elements of a given treasure's history are determined by certain narrative requirements that the tradition continues to maintain. I also argue that in some cases the rituals of revelation were performed not to produce treasure but to consecrate religious sites. Chapter Three examines the second version of the narrative map, composed by 'Jam mgon Kong sprul (1813-1899) in 1867. He composed it at a time when Khams's territorial integrity was threatened by an invading Tibetan army. The author is widely credited in the west with founding the so-called the Rimay movement which was supposedly a response to centuries of Tibetan sectarian prejudice and violence. This chapter reads the narrative map in a way that undermines that notion. It argues that while the map was in some ways a model of nonsectarianism, as it included sites associated with nearly all denominations of Tibetan Buddhism, it pointedly excluded from the religious geography of Khams the Dge lugs pa sect which at that time controlled the Tibetan government and army. In this way it established a geographic representation of Khams that symbolically preserved Khams's independence from Lhasa.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Religion, Religious history, History, Geography, China, Khams, Nineteenth century, Nonsectarianism, Religious geography, Revelation, Tibet",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304927709,"Li, Ji","Becoming faithful: Christianity, literacy, and female consciousness in northeast China, 1830–1930",Contemporary,"This dissertation presents a study about dialogue between contradictions: Christians and pagans, missionaries and converts, foreign and native, male and female, and above all the sacred and the profane. I explore how specific actors such as French Catholic missionaries of the Missions Etrangères de Paris (MEP) translated and disseminated the universality of the Christian message into the particular context of northeast China from the 1830s to the 1930s, and how Chinese Catholic converts, especially, female converts, interpreted and transformed the Catholic faith as a language to articulate an awareness of self. Focusing on the M.E.P Manchuria Mission, I analyze the Catechism and Regulations of the mission, as well as missionary statistical parish reports and private letters by both missionaries and Chinese converts. Understanding how Christianity took root in an Asian context requires that we not only study the universality of the Christian message and the inclusiveness of the missionary effort, but also the mechanisms, institutions, actors, and processes that interpreted the Christian faith through specific language, behavior, and belief. I discuss how the MEP translated the catechism to introduce the concepts and rituals of Christian faith to the rural Chinese. how they designed the Regulation of the Mission to teach the Catechism and to enforce Church discipline on missionaries, catechumens, and converts. and how they required systematic parish reports to measure and assess the success of local religious experience. The dissemination of Christian faith included translations of literal languages of French and Chinese as well as numerical language that observed and measured the “faith” of local converts. it also included the widespread establishment of religious educational system in rural society, which provided much of the educational opportunities for rural men and women and established the first extensive educational system for women in rural China. The Church's religious education produced a new female literacy , which created a new space for rural Christian women, regardless of their family background, to articulate awareness of self and to form/transform a new subjectivity.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Modern history, Catholicism, Catholicism in northeast China, China, Christianity, French missionary in China, Literacy, Missionaries, Women and religious education",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
2080000000,"Kim, Jaymin","Asymmetry and Elastic Sovereignty in the Qing Tributary World: Criminals and Refugees in Three Borderlands, 1630s-1840s",Modern,"This dissertation analyzes how Qing China (1636-1912) and three of its tributary states (Chos?n Korea, Vietnam, Kokand) handled interstate refugees and criminals from the 1630s to the 1840s. I use Classical Chinese and Manchu memorials and diplomatic documents from Qing archives in Beijing and Taipei as well as Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese published sources to construct a bilateral view of these interstate relations and compare them. My research reveals multiple, flexible, and shifting conceptions of boundaries, jurisdiction, and sovereignty. Boundaries between Qing and its tributaries were not absolute to a Qing court that claimed universal rule, and the court often erased them by adopting tributary refugees as Qing subjects or encroaching on tributary domains. Further, the Qing court often asserted jurisdiction over tributary subjects committing crimes on its soil or against its subjects. In contrast, no tributary court openly asserted jurisdiction over Qing subjects. Together, these cases reveal two defining characteristics of the Qing tributary order: asymmetry and elastic sovereignty. They show how the political norms of early modern Asia defy post-Westphalian norms of inter-state equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of fellow sovereign states. This work breaks new ground in Chinese history by highlighting Qing imperial projects outside today’s Chinese borders and by comparing borderlands in Northeast, Southeast, and Central Asia. It is also a work of world history that combines the connective method and the comparative method in a novel way, focusing on interactions across interstate boundaries in Asia while comparing these Asian borderlands with those in other early modern empires such as Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Lastly, my work engages with the field of international relations by reconstructing the contours of interstate affairs in early modern Asia before the introduction of public international law to the region, thus answering the recent call by scholars for a more inclusive, pluralistic view of international relations.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,History,History,"Social sciences, Borderlands, Law, Qing, Sovereignty, Tributary system,",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304248665,"Lo, Ming-cheng Miriam",From national physicians to medical modernists: Taiwanese doctors under Japanese rule,Contemporary,"In order to explore the contingent relationship between professionalism and colonialism, this dissertation investigates the radical transformations of Taiwanese doctors' public activity during Japanese occupation. I focus on how these doctors' actions and discourses evolved over three periods. My analysis suggests a set of mechanisms that propelled the changes. In the first period (1920-1931), strong professional autonomy, a liberal, humanist professional culture, and critical discourses in civil society mobilized doctors in anti-colonial activities. In the second period (1932-1936), the decrease in professional autonomy and the increase in civil regulation demobilized these doctors. Beginning in the second and continuing into the third period (1937-1945), doctors' modernist professional culture and promising career opportunities further co-opted them. While these mechanisms generated the conditions for doctors to become anti-colonial, demobilized, or co-opted, these conditions did not dictate the specificity of doctors' public identities. Doctors drew upon their experiences in particular historical junctures to imagine and articulate their identities. They developed a public identity as national physicians in their anti-colonial activities, lost this legacy later, and constructed a new identity as medical modernists as they became co-opted. While focusing on a specific historical period, the dissertation addresses two broader theoretical problems. Focusing on how profession/ethnicity relations are contextualized in state/society relations, I argue that the mobilization of professionals is often embedded in multiple sets of collective action. Thus, colonial professionals tend to de-naturalize their political goals and develop fluid collective identities. This proposition reinstates professions into the heart of civil society. Furthermore, my study of colonial professionals also documents the incompleteness of both colonial domination and resistance, and, accordingly, proposes a hybridization perspective for colonial studies. The hybridization perspective compels us to recognize how the assimilating and destabilizing forces blend to create the colonial hybrid, and how it generates the potential for new types of imagination, political energy, and social identities.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Michigan,NA,NA,"Social structure, History, Political science, Health, China",35,Ann Arbor,Michigan,42.2759,-83.731,United States
304524222,"Luo, Xiaopeng",Market integration and grain policy reform: A case study of the rice market in South China,Contemporary,"After the success of China's de-collectivization in the early 1980s, the cost for the government to maintain its control over surplus grain became prohibitive. But reforms for grain distribution repeatedly failed, forming two similar policy cycles between 1985 and 1997. Liberalizing grain trade seemed to be causing prices to increase after the subsidized government stocks were depleted. And policy makers mistakenly reacted to the price increases by resuming control of grain surpluses, actually fueling food inflation. Driven by the vicissitudes of the government inventories, the trade-off made by the policy makers between the costs and the perceived need to control grain surpluses shifted policy preference between free trade and provincial self-sufficiency. Two complementary econometric approaches for spatial price analysis, the Engle-Granger Cointegration Test and the Parity Bounds Model have been applied to the time series of rice retail prices, collected from nine provinces in South China between 1987–1997. Test results indicated that spatial integration of the rice market in South China has been fragile or unstable for individual market pairs. The overall market tended to be more spatially integrated when price levels (nominal) were rising, but it tended to be more segmented when price levels were falling. Grain market integration was primarily improved by the rise of peasant marketing but it was usually harmed when government trade flows expanded, because government grain stocks were valued in artificial pricing mechanism rather than by market prices. The results of the spatial integration tests are consistent with the fluctuations of government trade flows caused by the two policy reform cycles between 1985 and 1997. As the government lost its cost advantage in grain marketing to the peasants in the 1990s, it became more difficult for the government to control the grain surpluses. Keeping the government prices below the market value was politically troublesome for policy makers, but raising prices closer to market value meant intolerable costs for the government. As a result, policy makers again banned the peasants on grain marketing in 1998, however, this decision only trapped China's grain policy even deeper in a deadlock.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"Agricultural economics, Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, History, China, Economic transition, Grain marketing, Market integration, Policy reform, Rice market",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
304358518,"Qi, Xiaoxin","A matter of cultural discourse: Religion, nation, gender",Contemporary,"From 1890 to 1950 more than two hundred women from the Midwest went to China as missionaries. This study examines how these evangelical women engaged in diversified intercultural dialogues about gender identity and women's places in family and society. This study argues that the intercultural discourse was not in isolation from, but in the context of the Chinese local history in Henan province where the women missionaries resided. This intercultural discourse was also embedded in the context of the global impact of modernization which became a shared driving force for making social changes in China. The study is composed of two parts. Part One examines the importance of both evangelical women and Chinese women's conceptualization of family and work in their respective evangelical and nationalist contexts. The evangelical women found a common ground in China's modernization that absorbed many Western ideas and values. They looked at their social reform in China's modern education and medicine as a means to reach the goal of Christian conversion. Chinese women embraced the ideas of modern education and professionalization of women in work places. But in theory and practice they related these efforts of social reform to what was considered a unique Chinese family revolution within China's modern, nationalist revolution. Part Two focuses on four specific areas of the gender dialogues: the family, education, medicine, and individual politics. While the more conservative evangelical women did not find much meaning outside the issue of conversion, most other women acknowledged values of cultural differences, and experienced challenges about the separate spheres and women's gender identity. A few evangelical women became sympathizers for the Chinese revolution. Meanwhile, as cultural agents for social changes the women missionaries had a direct impact in Henan province by providing different or new ideas, values, and social services to the local Chinese in Henan province. The thesis concludes that modern, international politics interplayed with positive gender and cultural exchanges between the Midwest women missionaries and the Chinese in rural Henan.

304071208,"Xing, Jun",Baptized in the Fire of Revolution: The American Social Gospel and the YMCA in China: 1919–1937,Contemporary,"This study, based mainly on archival sources, examines how the social gospel, an indigenous American reform ideology, trademarked by its American religious, social and cultural characteristics, was exported to the turbulent Chinese situation in the early twentieth century by the Young Men's Christian Association. Employing Antonio Gramsci's rediscovered theory of cultural hegemony, it argues that the process of implanting the American social gospel onto the Chinese setting involved a constant struggle of resistance, negotiations, and synthesis among multiple ideologies and cultural forces, including the old Protestant evangelicalism, the indigenous Neo-Confucianism, Chinese nationalism and international communism. The social gospel experience in China formed a perplexing but significant chapter in the history of Sino-US cultural relations. The present study is organized around three major themes of the social gospel as reflected in the Chinese YMCA's work. (1) In contrast to the evangelists, the YMCA secretaries, as the Y officers were called, sought to interpret the Christian message in terms of China's cultural heritage. In the process, they challenged the missionary enterprise itself. Their efforts represented a pioneering, if limited, pluralistic vision in cross-cultural communications. (2) With a new sense of cosmopolitanism, the Association intellectuals developed a social reform ideology embodied in the concept of Kingdom of God. Through an analogy with the Confucian idea of Ta Tung Shih chieh, the Y men literally removed the religious overtones of this Kingdom concept, while emphasizing its social and ethical meanings. To broaden the appeals of the social gospel, they even identified a limited philosophical synthesis between communism and Christianity. (3) Christian pacifist ideals formed another important part of the social gospel. As a voluntary agency, the YMCA cultivated a spirit of internationalism in a time of war and violence by sponsoring the ill-fated Institute of Pacific Relations.

The author used an historical methodology to review the evolution of HRD strategies and policies adopted by the government, private and public enterprises, civic organizations, and research institutions in Taiwan. The purposes of this study were to trace the history of HRD in Taiwan since the 1950s, identify HRD patterns from the history of HRD in Taiwan since the 1950s, and posit an HRD definition that is derived from the history of HRD in Taiwan. This overview of the government-initiated and government-encouraged emergence of developing human resources to boost Taiwan's economy and enhance Taiwanese welfare is analogous at the macro level to the concept of HRD in business management at the micro level. Since the 1960s, Taiwan's HRD strategy has been integrated with national economic objectives for the nation, and there exists a national structure of government agencies and organizations responsible for planning and implementing these strategies. Since the 1980s, the series of measures designed to liberalize and to restructure the economy have played a vital role in establishing a foundation for employee training and, in particular, enterprise training, in Taiwan. The upgrading of industries and the advancement of competitive ability in the international market since the 1990s certainly has been important in strengthening the role of HRD in Taiwan. Three factors have been fundamental in shaping Taiwan's development of HRD: (1)&#xa0.Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's teachings. (2)&#xa0.the government's commitment to develop its economy and to fulfill social expectations through the development of human resources. and (3)&#xa0.the pragmatic and pluralistic approaches adopted in policy formulation. Finally, the author provided nine patterns derived from the history of HRD, and she also posited three functions for Taiwan's HRD system. In addition, the author provided a definition of HRD derived from the history of HRD in Taiwan—HRD is an intentional, innovative, long-term, and committed process of developing an individual's work-related learning capabilities through vocational education and training, organization development, and career development with an aim to contribute to individual, organizational, and national growth.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"Business education, Vocational education, Education history, History, Public administration, Management, China, Economic restructuring, Human resource development, Taiwan",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States

The British East India Company surgeons initiated this movement in 1807 and medical missionaries extended it from the 1830s into the 1930s. This account is based on data found in archival repositories in China, manuscript libraries in the United States, and reports in missionary and medical missionary publications. This study adds to the historiography on China’s medical missionary study by demonstrating the medical and religious integrative trajectory from its beginning to its ending in China. The results challenge assumptions about the nature and extent of a presumed modernity in this activity. Rather than asking what medical missionary efforts contributed to the broader missionary activity, this study investigated how medical practitioners were able to take advantage of the religious incursions. Careful analysis of local records indicates that the early foreign medical practitioners were typically in a nearly pre-professional state in terms of the skills they brought to China. Instead of bringing to China a firmly established and fully coherent Western medicine, these medical missionaries echoed medical trends in the West. Over time, they brought Western clinical institutions, the professional organizations, and increasingly advanced medical education. By the early twentieth century, the medical professionals gradually parted ways with their missionary sponsors. Relying primarily on Western sources, this study identifies three groups of Chinese who studied Western medical practice. Up to the 1880s, Chinese received apprentice training in order to become assistants to medical missionaries and their influence largely remained local. From 1880 on, Western physicians introduced advanced medical education. Elite Chinese physicians with Western training officially organized themselves in the 1910s. In 1932, these well-positioned physicians took over the leadership of the Western medical profession when the foreign and Chinese medical associations merged. Significantly, in the 1910s, the first generation of modern medical historians emerged. They struggled to make senses of their native medicine, which had been overshadowed by rhetoric that privileged Western culture. Nonetheless, they brought Chinese medical history to the world stage. The epilogue describes the abrupt interruption caused by the Japanese invasion in 1937. The medical missionaries’ movement in China ended when the majority of them left China, leaving a complex legacy.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,History of Science and Technology,History of Science,"China, Knowledge transfer, Medical missionary, Native medicine,",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
1037994256,"Field, Jesse L.",Writing Lives in China: the Case of Yang Jiang,Contemporary,"This dissertation is about the writer Yang Jiang (b. 1911). It opens up new intellectual territory by bringing together many forms of Chinese writing to describe the common influence of xie renwu or 'writing the person.' Though best-known for Gan xiao liu ji (Six records of a cadre school), Yang Jiang's memoir of experiences in a labor camp for intellectuals during China's Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), Yang Jiang's career as a whole testifies to the living value of story and portraiture manifested in plays, personal essays, literary criticism, translation, short stories, novels and biographical literature. Moreover, Yang Jiang's readership runs the gamut from enthusiastic welcome, in 1940s Shanghai, to rejection and silencing in the 1950s and 60s, and rising sharply upward again to iconic status in the 1990s and 2000s. Applying the terms and propositions of the interdisciplinary study of life writing, I identify the unity of Yang Jiang's writing in its focus on the person, and in particular the constant return to discourses of self, identity, subjectivity and social value entwined around traditional Confucian terms of personhood – especially qing, the sublime connection between persons based on feeling. Critics inside China call Yang Jiang one of the best prose stylists of her time. general readers call her life story inspirational. in 2011, newspaper reports identify in Yang Jiang the moral and aesthetic qualities most recommended for China today. And yet, her work has received scant attention from scholars outside of China. My dissertation begins the project of filling in this lacuna through historical contextualization and close readings centered on her post-Cultural Revolution writing. The aesthetic qualities of Chinese rhetoric, the classical and romantic qualities of Yang Jiang's prose, and the deeper political and social implications of her writing since the late 1970s are major topics of the chapters. Throughout, I focus on gender and class, arguing that Yang Jiang deploys traditional exemplary life writing (the image of the good wife and model mother, for example) to build up a discourse of personhood that contains a renewed version of traditional Chinese cultural values.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,"Asian Literature, Culture & Media","Asian Literature, Culture & Media","Comparative literature, History, Asian Studies, Biography, China, Chinese essay, Chinese fiction, Women writers, Yang, Jiang",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States

In chapter one, key theoretical approaches in human geography and the social sciences in general are invoked to better understand how social and biophysical factors condition forms of land use and lead to distinctive land cover patterns in remote sensing imagery and digital maps. Chapter two examines the intensity of use of cultivated land in Central Tibet based on an official Tibetan land decree from 1830. Employing a newly devised GIS methodology, the approximate amount of cultivated land in each Central Tibetan district is reconstructed and compared with the corresponding patterns as of the 1990s. The third chapter presents findings from recent field research derived from interviewing a diversity of households, most notably elderly farmers who, prior to 1959, worked for a noble estate that controlled large amounts of farmland and pasture in a Central Tibetan locale. These interviews and observations were designed to illustrate the role of micro-scale human organizational and decision-making processes in relation to land use patterns that have shaped aspects of the steppe habitat and interrelate with the historical development of Central Tibetan society and culture. Chapter four examines demographic and land use/cover patterns in the field research locale as a microcosm of macro-regional patterns throughout Central Tibet based on unpublished socioeconomic data obtained from a 1990s township archive, multi-temporal coarse-resolution satellite imagery, and a recent high-resolution land cover map. These local patterns are studied to better understand how millennia of co-evolution between the environment and human activities led to the creation of distinctive Tibetan cultural landscapes.

304065300,"Davison, Gary Marvin","Agricultural development and the fate of farmers in Taiwan, 1945-1990",Contemporary,"Among the convictions which fuel this dissertation is the tenet that successful agricultural development does not result in the death of farming as a profession. Others are as follows. Especially in a society whose history and culture have been laid on an agrarian foundation, any vision of a developed society will include economically and culturally vital agrarian communities. Strong agrarian communities are important for cultural and ecological reasons. They should be sustained on the basis of an economy that allows that portion of rural society which chooses agriculture as a profession to generate the great majority of its income through agricultural activities. Farmers and the agricultural economy have interests distinct from those of rural residents and the rural economy. there are obvious and even numerous points of intersection, but these are categorically distinct entities. Proceeding on the analytical and terminological foundation given above, I examine in the three parts of this dissertation the history of the Taiwanese farmer, the state of the contemporary agricultural economy in Taiwan, and the current body of farmer and other relevant opinion among the populace in Taiwan as to the fate of farmers during the 1945-1990 period of rapid economic development. Based on personal interviews and observations, personally administered surveys, varied writings on Taiwanese farmers and agriculture in the Chinese language, and government statistical data, my research leads me to the conclusion that while the rural economy and rural residents have fared very well in Taiwan, farmers and the agricultural economy have not. I find that agricultural development in Taiwan has been a success in most of its technical aspects but a failure in providing an economically viable future for the professional farmer. Given these findings, I conclude that a significant portion of the Taiwanese economy has been neglected even as its general economy grew robustly, and I suggest that scholars and economic development specialists should consider more carefully the fate of professional farmers in assessing the level of success of particular cases of economic development.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"History, Agricultural economics, Agriculture, China",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
304954267,"Liu, Lisong","Mobility, community and identity: Chinese student/professional migration to the United States since 1978 and transnational citizenship",Contemporary,"Between 1978 and 2002, China sent 580,000 students and scholars to study abroad. About two thirds of these students and scholars adjusted their immigrant status and became permanent residents of their residing societies, especially the United States that has received around forty to fifty percent of Chinese students abroad. This dissertation focuses on Chinese student migrants as a case of contemporary international professional migration and studies their mobility, identities, and community formation from historical and transnational perspectives. It begins with 1978 when China began its open-door and reform policies and U.S.-China relations were normalized. It examines the changing Chinese policies on migration and the increasing attention China paid to student migrants, revealing how student migrants’ transnational mobility was tied to China’s political and economic reforms. It then discusses how the preference for skilled and professional migrants in U.S. immigration laws developed over time and what Chinese and Asian student and professional migration revealed about post-1965 U.S. national identity and international relations. It also examines how professional migrants, with better social mobility than past generations of migrants, faced both opportunities and challenges in forming their local communities in post-1965 U.S. society. This dissertation in the end looks at the return and circular migration of Chinese student and professional migrants. It revises the conventional framework of studying immigration as a linear process and argues that for a large number of returning Chinese student migrants, citizenship is not a signifier of assimilation or of permanent settlement but a status used for transnational mobility transcending the national boundaries which define and justify citizenship. This dissertation draws from sociological, anthropological, and political science studies of recent migrants while providing historical perspective on the recent past. Its analysis is based on a wide variety of written documents in both Chinese and English, including censuses, surveys, immigration policies and laws, congressional records, government publications, media reports, immigrant organization records, as well as migrants’ online discussions.

304523375,"Barclay, Paul David",Japanese and American colonial projects: Anthropological typification in Taiwan and the Philippines,Contemporary,"This dissertation analyzes a transition which occurred as industrialized nation-states displaced early-modern empires as hegemons in the South China Sea during the “age of high imperialism.” As loosely integrated world-empires with weak state capacities, the Chinese and Spanish states in Taiwan and the Philippines did not extend their reach beyond the coastal plains. When Japan and the U.S. tore these archipelagos from the orbits of the fading empires at century's turn, the upland populations remained politically independent and unassimilated to metropolitan norms of religion, dress, architecture and language. Through the 1930s, the Japanese and American colonial bureaucracies worked to impose intellectual and administrative order upon the polyglot populations of Taiwan's and Luzon's central mountain ranges with land surveys, ethnological investigations, and the use of military force. Strikingly similar ethnological maps and taxonomies emerged from these parallel investigations and conquests. However, they fit into the overall upland policies of each colonial regime in very different ways. Each of these taxonomies served to stereotype, rank, and map the men and women they categorized, purportedly rendering these once little known peoples more accessible to the colonial state, but the claims colonial ethnologists made about the utility of such taxonomies and maps for extending control over these populations were exaggerated. Rather, the ultimate utility of “anthropological typification” to the colonial state was inversely proportional to the economic rewards and urgency of militarily occupying the highlands of each colony. The reason for this disjunction between anthropological typification and the severity of colonial rule in the highlands can be traced to the conflicting paradigms of the emerging discipline of academic anthropology and modern conceptions of citizenship, land tenure, and nationality. Anthropologists portrayed the highland village societies as constituents of culture areas, or as nations writ small. The rival colonial vision argued that stateless peoples had no rights in land or property. In Luzon, where the economic and security stakes were low, such a vision informed and guided U.S. administration. In Taiwan, where the uplands were rich in lucrative camphor, a colonial policy of occupation, dispossession, and forced relocation rendered anthropological categories and policy advice useless.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"History, American history, International law, International relations, Anthropological typification, China, Colonial projects, Japanese, Philippines, Taiwan",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
305156541,"Dennis, Joseph Raymond","Writing, publishing, and reading local histories in Ming China",Modern,"This dissertation is a case study in the history of the book in Ming China. I look at why people compiled gazetteers, how much they cost to produce, and how they were financed, printed, distributed, and read both inside and outside the communities that produced them. Although books are the entry point for this study, examining their production provides insights into various questions in Chinese social, cultural, and administrative history. Chapter one explores the purposes and politics behind the compilation of one sixteenth century gazetteer. I read the gazetteer as a whole and in conjunction with thirty lineage genealogies to show that the compilers were members of an extended family who wrote the gazetteer as a public genealogy of their family. Chapter two brings to light new evidence of the per-page cost of producing a book in Ming China, labor and materials costs, and financing methods. I show that funds for publication of gazetteers came from non-governmental as well as governmental sources and that there was a range in the degree of official involvement in their production. Chapter three examines the editing, printing, and distribution of local gazetteers. I use notes written by a gazetteer editor and publisher to examine technical and social issues related to the production process. I reconstruct movements of Ming printing craftsmen and the geographic distribution of the printing industry by taking advantage of the fact that gazetteers were produced in identifiable locales. I also review possible distribution methods and argue that many gazetteers were printed “on demand” from blocks that were stored in private homes, schools, and yamens. In chapters four and five I use individual readings of gazetteers to reconstruct local and translocal readership. Communities of local readers included people constructing lineage organizations who used local gazetteers to establish ancient family connections. people interested in relative family status in local society. and people involved in property disputes who used gazetteers to advance their claims.

304131447,"Hsu, Pi-ching",Celebrating the emotional self: Feng Meng-lung and late Ming ethics and aesthetics,Modern,"The broad goal of this dissertation is to look for clues about both changes in ideas and intellectual continuity in late Ming (1368-1644) China, and to study their possible associations with other contemporary phenomena. The narrower goal is to investigate the historical meaning of the discourse on self and ch'ing (human emotional responses to particular circumstances) at the juncture of late Ming popular and elite cultures. At the centerpiece of my study are the discussions of the relationships between men and women, self and society, ch'ing and li (reason. pattern. principle), and meanings and expressions in Feng Meng-lung's (1574-1646) popular literature. The study explores two worlds: the world in which Feng Meng-lung lived, and the world Feng Meng-lung created. In the first three chapters I discuss the political, economic, social, and cultural aspects of Chiang-nan (the lower Yangtze valley). the individualistic and romantic search of philosophers, writers, and artists for an authentic self. and the dichotomy of ch'ing and li in social and intellectual dimensions. In the last two chapters I analyze how Feng employed wit and humor to satirize human folly and social ailments--violation of ch'ing--in his anthologies Hsiao-fu (Treasury of Jokes), T'an-kai (Survey of Talk), and Chih-nang (Sack of Wisdom). and how he advocated genuine feelings and chivalrous action--embodiment of ch'ing--in his collections of folk and popular songs Kua-chih erh (Hanging Twigs) and Shan-ko (Hill Songs), collection of vernacular short stories San-yen (Three Words), and anthology of Chinese love stories Ch'ing-shih (History of Love). Late Ming China was a favorable milieu for the rise of popular vernacular literature and unorthodox thinking, perhaps due to urbanization and commercialization, loss of central control over cultural values and social regulations, gloomy prospect of political careers for the elite, and a high literacy rate. The result was more multifarious culture and society.

304436547,"Ness, John Philip",The southwestern frontier during the Ming dynasty,Modern,"This work examines efforts of the imperial Han Chinese state to integrate southwestern China politically, economically, and culturally during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). In theory the Ming state styled itself a universal empire to which all peoples owed allegiance. In practice this claim was often little more than a legitimating fiction. Even within what is now considered China proper large areas were resistant to the effective control of the state. The southwest was one such area. Much of the southwest is mountainous, infertile and unsuitable for Han-style agriculture. In Ming times Han settlement was largely confined to military outposts. The majority of the inhabitants were various groups of non-state people. Without taxpaying Han settlers, the Ming state found it difficult to administer the area directly. Consequently, the state relied upon local strongmen as agents of control. These cultural middlemen were given bureaucratic titles of office. Attempts were made to educate them to conform to Han Chinese cultural norms, but as long as they preserved the peace the Ming state stayed out of their internal affairs. During the late fifteenth century a central official, He Qiaoxin, was sent to the area to arbitrate a succession dispute in the office of one of these cultural middlemen that threatened to disrupt the peace in the area. His unofficial history, The Report on the Investigation of Bozhou Matters, is analyzed and compared with official records to discern the degree of economic and cultural integration of the area with the dominant Han Chinese culture. This investigation is based on the written records of the Han imperial state in which it is difficult to detect an authentic voice of the non-state peoples. To balance this deficiency this study incorporates a discussion of interaction between state and non-state where sources for the non-state perspective are better known. The Chinese experience is contrasted with the experience of Euroamericans in their interactions with Amerindian peoples in North America. In both cases, it is apparent that despite superior military power there are limits to the state's ability to assimilate non-state peoples.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"History, China, Frontier, Han Chinese, Ming",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
275653784,"Fang, Qin",Creating local landscape: Tidal bores and seawalls at Haining (1720s–1830s),Modern,"My dissertation explores landscape as a social and cultural instrument in the high Qing (1760s-1820s), a multi-ethnic empire with the largest territory and the most diverse ethnic groups in the history of China. In particular, I ask how a multi-ethnic empire rules and how the small county of Haining in east central China fit into the ruling house’s vision of its empire as a “great union.” Instead of answering these questions by examining the center of state politics (administration and state policies), I look at local politics. In this case I examine how seawalls, tidal phenomena, and scenes of daily life represented as Haining landscapes were collected and organized in local histories and imperially commissioned works. This dissertation thus seeks both to elucidate the historical relations between the imperial center and the locale and to address issues of wider concern to scholars of empire formation in the early modern world. Haining in the late imperial period was a small city located where the Qiantang River flows into China East Sea in Zhejiang province. Before the second half of the eighteenth century, Haining most commonly appeared in reports of local coastal floods caused by tidal bores and requests for famine relief. Following the construction of protective seawalls and the Qianlong emperor’s inspection tours to Haining in 1762, the image of tidal bores shifted. Once depicted as wild and uncontrolled natural disasters they now appeared as tamed and even aesthetically pleasing phenomena. Haining itself thereafter was celebrated in poems as a place holding a unique position as the destination for sightseeing related to the tidal bores and a booming cultural center noted for poets, bibliophiles, and scholars. The central thematic concern of my dissertation is the local response of Haining’s literati to the Qianlong emperor’s representations of Haning’s local landscapes. I analyze this response in terms of discursive representations functioning as political technology in service of power. While Qianlong used local landscapes to imagine Haining as a jigsaw puzzle piece in his multiethnic empire, local literati appropriated that imagination and manipulated the meaning of local landscapes in an effort to reinforce their own status. Despite their differences in terms of political agendas and interests, however, both the imperial and local representations of local landscapes facilitated to map out previously little known Haining as a highly cultivated place with beautiful sceneries on the imperial cultural map. My dissertation works on three types of textual representations of local landscape, natural sights (tidal bores), man-made structures (seawalls), and human performance (scenes of local daily life). Most were landscape poems anthologized and re-anthologized into Haining local histories since the sixteenth century. The rate of their incorporation into the histories rapidly increased in the late eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century, especially after textually constructed landscapes of Haining had been included in imperially sponsored works after the Qianlong emperor’s inspection tours to Haining. These poems constitute a unique kind of historical source material, one that invites an interdisciplinary approach. First, this body of material allows for a detailed study of the development of the largely unexamined local histories in the form of poems. Second, the landscape poems incorporated in imperially sponsored works can serve as a vehicle for examining one aspect of the Qing rule. As an example, the Qianlong emperor’s poems on his tours to seawalls and tidal bores function more as edicts to local officials than simply praises to local scenery beauty. Third, an exploration of the milieu from which they sprang poses questions about the relationship between the imperial center and its locale. Finally, this abundance of documentation also sheds light on the related matters of how recording and documenting of landscape poetry can forge a national identify for a multi-ethnic empire.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,History,History,"History, China, Haining, Landscape, Locality, Qianlong, Qing empire, Seawalls",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States

However, when examining the development of tea production and consumption within this period, we can find so many changes. This study examines tea consumption in China’s domestic market from the 1550s to the 1700s. During this period, some commodities rose to the top in the market, such as Longjing tea and Yixing teapot, while some of them declined and even disappeared from the market, such as Luojie tea. Some of them survived. however, consumers’ attitudes toward them became different, such as Songluo tea. Late-Ming scholar-official tea connoisseurs, for their part, played active roles in these transformations. They dominated the fashion of tea drinking through establishing a new set of aesthetic principles. These aesthetic principles and a new discourse of tea tasting emphasized the “true flavor” of tea.

305566586,"Yuan, Zujie","Dressing the state, dressing the society: Ritual, morality, and conspicuous consumption in Ming dynasty China",Modern,"By examining the changes in the clothing system and consumption patterns in late Ming China, my thesis explores how state-society relations were influenced by commercialization. The Chinese clothing system in the imperial age has been considered by some scholars of the Annales school to be a symbol of a stable society where fashion did not exist. While acknowledging the efforts of the Ming imperial government in regulating people's clothing, I challenge this argument by illustrating how changes of people's clothing and clothing consumption were driven by fashion since the Middle Ming (around 1500). On the one hand, the Ming state did use sumptuary laws to regulate people's dress in order to strengthen its control over society, on the other hand, commercialization in the late Ming, particularly in the Jiangnan area, contributed to the deregulation of the clothing system, and so undermined state power. While the early modern history of certain European countries witnessed the rise of state power that guaranteed incipient capitalism a relatively secure environment, the so-called “sprouts of capitalism” in China weakened state power by subverting its moral pillars and ritual discipline, worsening the conditions for further economic development. While tracing the changes of the Ming clothing system, with a focus on state-society relations, I also discuss Ming clothing production, gender patterns, class identity, and the influence of Chinese culture on economic development. If consumption and the rise of consumerism can be considered the principal forces facilitating capitalism and modernity in early modern Europe, evidence of equivalent phenomena in Ming society should point in the same direction. The leading role of the Yangzi delta in terms of economic development as well as cultural achievement indicates a close linkage between the two fields. The divergent modern paths of China and Europe, however, were rooted in their different cultural preferences, which can be observed through their clothing history.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, China, Clothing, Conspicuous consumption, Ming dynasty, Morality, Ritual, Society",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
304533350,"Yao, Yusheng",National salvation through education: Tao Xingzhi's educational radicalism,Contemporary,"Tao Xingzhi's (1891–1946) educational radicalism was an outstanding achievement of the Chinese intellectuals in their search for ways to modernize China. Characterized by pragmatism, populism, and utopianism, Tao's educational radicalism was in constant tension with promoters of new education, Chinese intellectuals and the Nationalist government. Tao's radical social vision of a classless society, rooted in Confucian utopianism, and cross fertilized with John Dewey's philosophy and the Chinese revolutionary discourse enabled him to conceptualize a theory of life education. Through radical educational and social reforms Tao sought to integrate intellectual and manual labor, school and society, education and life in order to create new men and women, a new society and a new world. The major American scholarship on Tao Xingzhi has mainly focused on Tao's relationship with Dewey. This narrow focus has blocked from our vision other sources and forces of equal or greater importance. Although a recent study has shifted its focus to pre-and-post Deweyan influences on Tao, its denial of Dewey's central importance in shaping Tao's theory of life education is rather a leap of faith than a factual conclusion. My study concurs with the mainstream scholarship on the central importance of Dewey in helping Tao to formulate his theory of life education. But I believe that there were more important intellectual and social forces at work, which facilitated his theoretical maturity in revolutionizing Dewey's philosophy of education. In my study of his theory of life education, I find a discrepancy between Tao's radical social vision of a classless society and Dewey's gradualist philosophy of education. To overcome this contradiction between revolutionary social vision and gradualist means, Tao had to create a more powerful revolutionary educational theory and social strategy. I argue that to understand why and how Tao revolutionized Dewey's philosophy of education it is necessary to examine how his radical vision interacted with the various intellectual and social forces in the 1920s and 1930s. And I conclude that Tao should be understood as an educational and social revolutionary rather than a Deweyan reformer in the formation of his theory of life education.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"History, Educational theory, China, Dewey, John, Educational radicalism, John Dewey, Life education, National salvation, Tao Xingzhi",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States

The three towns, Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, located at the confluence of the Yangzi River and its largest tributary, the Han River, were divided by water and the imperial administration. In less than fifty years, the three towns disappeared, and in their place emerged Wuhan, the largest Chinese city in terms of its urban area. The urban integration was so successful that their separate pasts have been left out of current public memory. The goal of my study is to understand why and how Wuhan was made, and what the obsession with the city's big size can tell us about Chinese imagination and experience of modernity in the twentieth century. In answering these questions, the project is designed to cover three periods from late Qing, the republic, to the early PRC, and to trace modernizing efforts made by successive regimes to create “Great Wuhan.” It focuses on five key historical periods—the late Qing reform, the urban self recovery after the 1911 revolution, the modernist planning from 1927–1936, Wuhan as a wartime capital in the Anti-Japanese War (1937–1945), and the socialist urban reconstruction from 1949 to 1957. The study shows the 1911 revolution as a turning moment when a modern city was designed to depart from its imperial antecedent. It was Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of Republican China, who first proposed the idea of “Great Wuhan.” Such a gigantic urban project shows that Sun was thinking “big.” I argued that his way of thinking prevailed with the emergence of a strong scientific faith, which primarily placed upon young technologically trained officials and engineers later. Like Sun Yat-sen, they envisioned a total transformation of modern China through re-engineering urban society and infrastructure construction. This “big” vision of modernity—gigantic and centralized—was promoted by both Chinese Nationalists and Communists and ran across time and ideology in shaping contemporary urban landscape. I also argue that the creation of Wuhan had been closely tied to the nation-state building in the early twentieth century. Sun's idea of “Great Wuhan” didn't gain currency until the late 1920s when the Nationalist party that inherited Sun's mantle came to power. From then on, efforts to make “Great Wuhan” always intensified at moments of national crisis and political change, through which the state consolidated its power and gained control over local society. The rise of nationalism along the time also contributed the obsession with bigness that fueled the ambitious project of “Great Wuhan.” It is under the CCP regime that the city of Wuhan was finally made. The socialist system and its strong nationalist movements established in the early years of PRC proved to be more effective in carrying out the mega city project.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,History,History,"History, Geography, Modern history, China, Chinese urban history, City planning, Mega-city, Twentieth century, Wuhan",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
305304830,"He, Qiliang","News about killing, news that killed: Media culture and identities in the 1920s China",Contemporary,"My dissertation explores the question about how urban media shaped an urban identity and personal identities in the twentieth century China. My research centers on two sensational cases in Shanghai. One of them is a comprador's murder of a famous prostitute in 1920. the other one is a wealthy young woman's elopement with her male servant in 1928. Newspapermen, novelists, dramatists, filmmakers and street artists---such as storytellers and folklore singers---all pursued these two cases. The media's fascination over these two cases was because the human dramas touched upon a set of issues that were specific to Shanghai, such as international business as embodied in comprador, sex-entertainment (the celebrity prostitute), and the fluidity of class and gender (elopement). Urban media represented the murder as a modern case that resembled Hollywood detective films, and displayed every detail of modern life styles in Shanghai. Producers thereby solicited audiences to participate in modern experience via consuming such representations. The elopement subverted family values and class distinctions. The young woman, who had received a new style education, was painted as a modern girl challenging the feudal family, the marital system and traditional morality in China. Media's interpretation of the elopement enabled the couple to justify their love affair and performed their personal identities as pursuers of free love and marriage in the media. Urban media's coverage of these two cases enables me to explore how individual cultural forms, such as newspapers, novels, drama and film, closely connected with each other by sharing personnel and texts. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, writers, dramatists, newspapermen and filmmakers in Shanghai simultaneously embarked on multiple careers and tended to capitalize on the same texts such as these two cases. This dissertation examines how this unique cultural operation created maximal audiences. Namely, while individual cultural forms were intended to cater to specific social groups, media culture as a whole could exert impact on much wider audiences of heterogeneous social and cultural backgrounds. Media culture's capability of linking urban residents enabled the audiences to participate in a new public media realm.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"History, Journalism, Asian literature, Motion pictures, China, Identities, Killing, Media culture, News, Nineteen 20s",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
873812795,"Hu, Xiangyu",The Juridical System of the Qing Dynasty in Beijing (1644–1900),Modern,"This dissertation examines how the Qing ruling house balanced relations between Manchu and Han and between crown and bureaucracy from the perspective of Qing legal history. I purposely chose to study these questions in Beijing. It was not only the capital but also home to the largest single body of bannermen (Manchus and other ethnic groups under the banner system). Interactions between crown and bureaucracy, on the one hand, and Manchu and Han, on the other, are clearly in focus here. The research delineates the processes by which the Qing court adopted and revised the Ming juridical system while abandoning its earlier Manchu legal tradition. The early Qing ruler Dorgon tried to impose the Manchu judicial system on the Han people, but he quickly realized the impossibility of the imposition and the necessity of adopting the Ming judicial system. The Qing court gradually recognized the authority of the Qing code (a code based on the Ming code) and even adopted Ming juridical principles on the fundamental issue of Manchu society: the fugitive law that prohibited bannermen, especially slaves, from escaping. Manchus and Han were adjudicated by the Qing code at the same courts in Beijing by the middle Qianlong reign (1736-95). Bannermen’s legal privileges were a site of compromise needed to admit the authority of the Han judicial system, and these privileges were actually a sign of Qing sinicization. By analyzing the “normalization” of the law before 1900, or the processes by which the Qing court diminished bannermen’s juridical privileges and treated bannermen and civilians more and more “equally,” I argue that bannermen’s legal privileges were always secondary to sinicization. My study argues against the view that Manchus and Han were judicially segregated and also strongly supports the Sinocentric historiography with new approaches. The study considers the relationship between the crown and bureaucrats through the lens of the Qing judicial system. It reveals that in Beijing, the judicial system was composed of various institutions that shared responsibilities and power. This research thus demonstrates that at least in Beijing, the Qing judicial structure was not hierarchically and vertically arranged. I argue instead that power was deliberately divided between branches so that no single institution or person ever became too powerful. The structure was so solid that the late Qing monarchy was unwilling to make major reforms even when the system was working poorly.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,History,History,"History, Law, Bannerman, Beijing, Beijing Jingshi, China, Fugitive, Juridical system, Manchu, Qing code, Qing dynasty, Shunzhi",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
303919987,"Andrew, Anita Marie",Zhu Yuanzhang and the Great Warnings (Yuzhi Da Gao): Autocracy and rural reform in the early Ming,Modern,"The Great Warnings (Yuzhi Da Gao) is a pivotal text in early Ming social legislation. It reveals the personal style, views, and activism of Zhu Yuanzhang, the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty, whose reign (1368-1398) left a legacy of institutional change and autocracy that would endure for the rest of the imperial age. Zhu issued the Great Warnings in three compilations between 1385 and 1387. As a whole, these texts are reflective of the founder's hostility toward officialdom during the 1380s and his subsequent identification with rural commoners as his personal agents. This study focuses on the social transformation which Zhu Yuanzhang sought to implement through the Great Warnings, first at the village level of society as the ideal environment for reform. He attempted both to insulate the village from the corruption and manipulation he associated with local officialdom and their functionaries and to open up a direct channel of communication and social control between the throne and the good people of the villages. An important indication of the founder's commitment to social transformation was his empowerment of worthy commoners, especially the village elders. In the Great Warnings he empowered them by loosening regular travel restrictions to the capital for those presenting information about their locale, by encouraging commoners to rise up against oppressive local officials, functionaries, and other local bullies and report them to the capital for prosecution, and by providing rewards for students and their teachers who dedicated themselves to memorizing the text. The goal of Zhu's reforms would be to extend the control of the state over rural society more effectively than ever before. It was not an issue of creating an autonomous village community. Zhu's own evaluation of his rural reform efforts as well as his agents among the village commoners in the third compilation of the Great Warnings includes cases of resistance to his directives and even cases of corruption involving the elders. Despite this recognition of problems, Zhu Yuanzhang continued to stress the importance of the Great Warnings and its theme of rural reform until the end of his reign.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"History, Law, China",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States
304400343,"Jiang, Yonglin",The Great Ming Code: A cosmological instrument for transforming all under heaven,Modern,"The Great Ming Code (Da Ming lu) is one of the most important law codes in all of Chinese history. It not only set forth the value system and social norms for the Ming empire for several centuries, but also had a deep impact on the legal cultures of the Chinese Qing dynasty and China's neighboring countries of Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. This study focuses on the nature of the Great Ming Code as an embodiment of the envisioned cosmic order and its intended role in the imperial effort to educate the people and to transform society. The early Ming ruling elite, headed by the founding emperor Zhu Yuanzhang (1328-1398), based the Great Ming Code on what they understood as tianli (Heavenly principle) and renqing (human sentiments) with the function to educate the people and to transform society in line with the cosmic order. This goal is illustrated by three groups of regulations: rituals for communicating with the world of spirits, the cosmic parents of human beings. norms for structuring and purifying the human realm. and rules for rectifying the ruling elite's behavior in mediating between the world of spirits and the realm of human beings. On the basis of their legal cosmology, the early Ming ruling elite endowed the Great Ming Code with religious meaning. They envisioned the cosmos as an organic unit where the superhuman world possessed the power to intervene in human affairs. What the emperor ought to do was to follow Heavenly principle and preserve harmony both within society and between human beings and superhuman spirits. One way to achieve this was to establish law by following Heavenly principle. Law, in other words, served as a cosmological instrument to transform human beings. My study challenges the conventional viewpoints that perceive law in imperial China as an oppressive tool which was only concerned with political control and as a secular culture which had little to do with superhuman forces. I suggest that the early Ming ruling elite held a holistic view regarding the cosmos and the human realm. and law, religion, and political authority were not differentiated.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"History, Law, China, Ming dynasty",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States

The advertisements in the Shenbao newspaper between 1912 and 1937 were selected to examine the construction of Chinese modern women and Chinese modernity in advertising. The Chinese advertising industry promoted a material modernity based on the endless consumption of industrial goods. Consumption became the fundamental way of defining Chinese women's identities and their relationship to society. There were three major gender discourses of Chinese women constructed under the overarching discourses of Chinese people as a consuming population: Chinese women as female citizen-consumers, Chinese women as educated wives and mothers, and Chinese women as modern-girl consumers.

840544618,"Jiang, Yu","State Building, Capitalism, and Development: State-Run Industrial Enterprises in Fengtian, 1920–1931",Contemporary,"During the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), Western powers and Japan forced China to open its market and flooded the country with goods produced by large-scale industrial enterprises. The Chinese found that with military defeat, they lost not only political sovereignty but also economic interests. The situation was even worse in Northeast China (often called Manchuria in English), where the Russians and the Japanese built railroads and seaports and gained extraterritoriality over large stretches of land. With such advantage, the two imperialist powers, especially the Japanese, dominated the Northeastern economy. For the Chinese, the only way out was to establish native industrial enterprises. The Chinese regional state in the Northeast (known as the Fengtian Clique, 1916-1931) most urgently wanted to develop a modern economy, because it was the only viable way to generate wealth and strengthen the state in the long run. Due to the lack of a full-fledged bourgeoisie, the regional state had to be very hands-on in economic modernization – it established and managed large-scale industrial enterprises. In the process, the state became the largest business owner and the forerunner in capitalist enterprises. In this study, I investigate two industrial enterprises established under the leadership of Fengtian Civil Governor Wang Yongjiang – the Fenghai Railway Company and the Fengtian Textile Mill. These state-run enterprises were joint-stock companies strictly formulated according to the Company Law, which were based on Western laws. The provincial government, as the largest shareholder and the manager, ran the companies rigorously in a rational and profit-oriented way and competed in the open market. This phenomenon requires us to re-think capitalism – its existing paradigms and generalizations should be re-examined and new theoretical possibilities explored. I tentatively propose the concept of capitalism embedded in state bureaucracy, as I see in the two state-run companies. To wit, it was capitalism not led by the bourgeois class. The state became a capitalist in its endeavors to develop regional economy and to strengthen itself. For Karl Marx, capitalism was essentially defined by a new mode of production, in which the bourgeoisie own the means of production while the workers are deprived of it. He therefore often referred to the form of society created by capitalist mode of production “bourgeois society.” For Max Weber, the fundamental nature of capitalism is rationality, mainly embodied in “rational capital accounting.” Weber better grasped the essence of capitalism, because his conceptualization stripped it of the unnecessary class-based elements. Through empirical examination of two provincial enterprises in Fengtian, I demonstrate that rationality was indeed the driving force of capitalism. Under certain circumstances, rationality can bring about capitalism, without the sociopolitical and economic preconditions such as private ownership of means of production, highlighted by Marx and even Weber. The capitalism in Northeast China during 1920s is quite different from the conventional, Marxian understandings of Chinese capitalism, which have centered on the bourgeois class. To better understand capitalism, I believe, we have to make a clear distinction between its origins in Western Europe and its replication in other parts of the world – the trajectories are bound to be vastly different. If the gestation of the world’s first capitalism as an economic force was a prolonged process, necessarily concomitant with profound social or cultural transitions, as elaborated by Marx and Weber, its replication around the world often takes place more quickly and easily, with only small changes in the sociopolitical context. Through this empirical study, I hope to show that capitalist development can unfold in highly distinctive and localized manners.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,History,History,"History, Modern history, Capitalism, China, Fenghai Railway, Northeast China Manchuria, State building, State-run enterprises, Wang, Yongjiang, Zhang, Zuolin",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States

This study examines the modernization process from the perspective of the inhabitants of Pingxiang County and argues that the strategies mine managers employed to modernize the mines as well as the local reactions to them were influenced by the social and political features of the county as they were evolving prior to the early years of mechanization. In particular the government policies which placed near total control over Pingxiang County coal mining in the hands of government officials and their assistants led to conflicts with Pingxiang County elites and non-elites alike. The gentry elites came to view the modernization of their county with disgust. Young scholars wrote posters denouncing the foreign penetration into their county. The older gentry, especially those who owned mines prior to mechanization, blamed Zhang Zhidong for taking their lands unfairly and sought to slow down or halt the modernization process. Using their status as gentry, these men wrote letters to Zhang Zhidong's assistants and to the Jiangxi Provincial government criticizing the mechanization process. Unlike the gentry elites, the miners viewed the exploitation they experienced in the mines as similar to other forms of exploitation they experienced as laborers and peasants. Rather than struggling to close the mines as the gentry elite did, the miners sought to reform their working conditions and wages. To this end miners and their families, who could wield little power through the official channels, joined local secret society lodges and participated in a series of rebellions in opposition to their treatment at the hands of the mine managers.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Minnesota,NA,NA,"History, Political science, China, nineteenth century, twentieth century",34,Minneapolis,Minnesota,44.9635,-93.2678,United States

I will especially emphasize two aspects of their experiences in cities: the ways in which women emerged as a public presence in the urban landscape, and the ways in which women's issues became a social phenomenon under the public observation and discussion. To be specific, I focus on three most-debated issues in Tianjin: women’s physical body (footbinding), women's education, and women’s performance. The three themes had for a long time been rooted in Chinese society and culture and symbolized the normative womanhood or its opposite side. When it came to the modern era, the themes of publicizing women’s deformed feet, the transition from private inner chambers to public women's schools, and the extreme publicity of actresses on and off the stage became social issues in Tianjin, with which the city had never dealt before, or at least not to this extent. All the discussions, debates, arguments, and reforms of these issues affected groups of women such as missionary women, educated women, and actresses and dramatically changed their life styles and their identities in the city. New definitions of social and gender norms were forming to discipline women’s behaviors and spheres. It is the negotiation between women and the forming norms that a space was created between layers for these women to actually lived with flexibility and agency.

The adoption of modern transportation technologies enabled Tianjin to occupy a crucial position in the emerging national and global transport and trade networks, Tianjin thus became one of a few cities that made the transition from a traditional commercial city on the Grand Canal to a modern seaport and railroad hub. Instead of taking a city’s modernity for granted, this dissertation examines how the physical forms of modernity came into being in Tianjin by connecting these processes to the adoption of new technologies and the building of national and international networks of transportation. Studying Tianjin from this angle, this dissertation sheds light on why, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a select few cities thrived even as China as a whole was struggling economically and politically. While fundamentally transforming Tianjin’s status, these new transport technologies also led to unintended consequences, which revealed the contingencies in modernization and the complexity of the Chinese modernity. In order to make the port of Tianjin a high-capacity, reliable harbor for large steamships, the river connecting Tianjin with the sea was drastically reshaped during the first two decades of the twentieth century. These efforts, however, created environmental problems that eventually harmed the sustainability of the port. In the construction of the railroads connecting Tianjin with critical resources, the Qing officials demonstrated their ability in employing western capital and professionals while curtailing western intervention in the railroad planning. Officials and local elites dominated the urban planning of Tianjin, trying to divert the benefit of the railroads toward the Chinese administered parts of the city. At the turn of the twentieth century, a system of electric tramways was forced upon Tianjin mainly to display the superiority of western civilization and technology. Bearing the mark of imperialism and being far ahead of the actual demand for mass transportation, the tramway system met with enormous resistance. The protests to the tramway often utilized the modern media and the discourses of nationalism and sovereignty.

She addressed both Houses of Congress, conferred with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House, and spoke to U.S. audiences in New York City. Wellesley, Massachusetts. Chicago. San Francisco. and Los Angeles. By the end of her tour, she had rallied the U.S. public to support China in the war against Japan, both monetarily and emotionally. Her attempts to persuade President Franklin Roosevelt to change the Allied war plan, send more war supplies, and include China in all war and peace negotiations, however, were not as successful. This dissertation explains why Madame Chiang experienced different reactions from the U.S. public and the U.S. Government through an analysis of her personae. Personae are social frameworks through which audience members attribute specific characteristics to a rhetor. If the personae are positive and either archetypal or directly linked to the audience members' culture, identification between the audience members and the rhetor is enhanced. Identification increases persuasion. Conversely, if the personae are negative and/or not linked to the culture of the audience members, the rhetor may be less persuasive. Personae are not static. they may change as new information is presented to the audience members. During Madame Chiang's tour, the American public attributed the personae of First Lady, Charlie Chan, and Joan of Arc to her. In private, however, the Dragonlady persona emerged in the minds of those with whom she worked. This dichotomy between her personae in public and in private allowed for overwhelming public support but less than sterling results in her private negotiations.

Yet by the end of 1941 American policy in Asia was bound to Chiang Kai-shek and his regime. Although the Nationalists hadn't changed, opinions and circumstances had. How this transformation evolved is the thesis of this study. While this work is primarily a study of the Sino-American alliance that developed between 1936 and 1941, it also discusses the foundations of that alliance both in China and the United States. It begins with the rise of Chiang Kai-shek and how he came to consolidate power in revolutionary China in 1927. It also discusses Nationalist policies in early years of the Nanking Decade, and the impact of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. American foreign policy objectives in the Far East prior to 1936 are examined in detail in order to establish a basis for subsequent policies. Japanese actions in Manchuria and later North China challenged not only the limits of American policy, but also the multilateral peace agreements of the 1920s. Various interest groups such as missionaries, businessmen, philanthropists and the press were always influential with Americans and American policy regarding China. By the late 1930s, these groups would have a significant impact in bringing about major policy changes in the Far East. The year 1936 was pivotal to Chiang Kai-shek in terms of internal unification and international recognition as the de facto ruler of China. Following Chiang's kidnapping and release in Sian, Americans were optimistic over his commitment to form a united front with the Communists to defeat the Japanese. However that optimism did not translate to material assistance following the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Despite the collapse of the international peace system in Brussels in November 1937, the American public remained largely indifferent to China's appeals for assistance. Within that context, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau worked quietly to grant economic aid to China. Public indifference also led to the rise and influence of private Americans in forming non-governmental organizations to lobby Congress and the Roosevelt Administration on behalf of assistance to China. In addition to publicizing China's plight in the American media, it was these former missionaries, philanthropists, writers and publishers who were most influential in transforming Chiang Kai-shek from dictator to democrat in the hearts and minds of the American people. Ultimately Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy in 1940 compelled the Roosevelt Administration to take action in the Far East. Because Japan threatened American interests in the Pacific, it became necessary for the United States to have a stable ally in the region. That ally could be none other than Chiang Kai-shek.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of New Mexico,NA,NA,"American history, History, International law, International relations, Ally, Chiang Kai-shek, China, Foreign policy, Taiwan",2,Albuquerque,New Mexico,35.1054,-106.6465,United States
304616718,"Ye, Lin","In China's shadow: United States foreign policy toward Hong Kong, 1945–1972",Contemporary,"In the course of its century as a British colony, Americans quickly established themselves in the economic, social, and religious life of Hong Kong but never developed major direct national interests in the territory. During the first half of the twentieth, American policymakers began to consider Hong Kong within the larger framework of its policies towards and objectives in China. Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt championed China's right to recover the territories it had lost to European colonialism, both out of practical considerations as well as the advancement of its idealistic blueprint for a new international order. But faced with a very delicate situation when the time had come to end the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the United States bent to realistic interests and considerations and the Great Britain restore its rule over Hong Kong. The spread of the Cold War to East Asia revived the question of Hong Kong's fate. The victory of the Chinese Communists on the Mainland China threatened the survival of British control of Hong Kong. That posed a major dilemma and challenge to Washington. The United States understood that Hong Kong was indefensible, but it was unwilling to concede the territory and its people to the Communists. The problem was soon compounded by the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950. The United States was therefore caught between its anticommunist crusade and desire to deny Hong Kong to the PRC, on the one hand, and its fear of another direct military confrontation with Beijing. Fortunately for the United States and Great Britain, the Chinese Communist leadership excluded Hong Kong from the struggle against colonialism. The present study is the first attempt to provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of United States involvement in Hong Kong from the middle of the nineteenth century to the 1970s. It demonstrates that Hong Kong served as a polyhedron in Sino-American relations in the twentieth century. It is hoped that this effort will stimulate further research that will enlarge our understanding of the American presence in East Asia and China's reciprocal response.

At the end of 1948, military forces of the CCP won a civil war in Manchuria, after which the Party leaders began to build socialism in the region following the Soviet model and use it as a logistic base in their war against the United States in Korea from 1950 to 1953. Stalin and other Soviet leaders initially viewed the CCP victory with uncertainty but, in the process of the following several years, adapted Soviet security considerations to the CCP ambitions and needs. As a result, the Soviet Union had made valuable friends with the Chinese by 1953. In part because of U.S. legacies in China in the immediate aftermath of World War II, Truman administration officials had difficulties adjusting U.S. foreign policy to a dramatically changed situation in Manchuria as caused by the CCP victory.

304367201,"Li, Li","Mission in Suzhou: Sophie Lanneau and Wei Ling Girl's Academy, 1907-1950",Contemporary,"My dissertation is about the history of the Baptist women's mission in Suzhou, China. Sophie Lanneau, a Southern Baptist missionary from North Carolina, brought gospel for the Chinese women in northern Suzhou. She created Wei Ling Girl's Academy as a base for her mission. Between 1907 and 1950, both Lanneau and Wei Ling experienced such major historical events as the Chinese Republican Revolution, the Nationalist Revolution, the Sino-Japanese War, the civil war, and the Communist takeover. Gradually, Lanneau accepted Suzhou as her home while Wei Ling incorporated itself into the Chinese educational system. Despite this transformation the mission ended with Lanneau returning to America and Wei Ling being confiscated by the Chinese government. The history of Wei Ling proves the Baptist mission to be a two way street in which Lanneau as well as the Chinese families and Christians contributed to both its success and failure. On one hand, Lanneau adjusted local society and accommodated to Chinese educational demands. Her tions enabled her to lead the school's growth sometimes hostile environment under Chinese nationalism. Yet underneath her pragmatic concessions was her firm commitment to the Christianization of China, a commitment that caused her continued disputes with Wei Ling's students and their parents. On the other hand, all of Wei Ling's students came to the academy hoping to use its Christian education to raise their social status and help them find better jobs. They thus favored Wei Ling with their tuition payments and enthusiasm. They nevertheless refused to convert to Christianity and often resisted Lanneau's evangelism. The two sides always had a hard time in reconciling their goals. As a result, Wei Ling's focus shifted back and forth between evangelism and education.

304481287,"Fischer, Benjamin Louis",Opium pushing and Bible smuggling: Religion and the cultural politics of British imperialist ambition in China,Contemporary,"In the early decades of the nineteenth century, British missionaries disrupted the century-old tea-trade triangle by their insistence on penetrating the closed Chinese empire. Their cultural knowledge made these missionaries attractive potential allies for merchants while also giving accounts of their mission a literary appeal. Although missionary writing was intended for specifically Evangelical audiences, the influence of these works extended to popular culture and into the crafting of foreign policy for the Opium War as the political situation in China intensified due to opium trafficking. The first chapter traces the scholarly traditions on mission and imperialism, and the missionary movement in China. It also shows that two differing perspectives on mission and empire derive from competing subcultures in early-nineteenth-century Britain: middle-class popular culture and the growing Evangelical subculture. The second chapter adapts the notions of “imagined communities” and an “imperial archive” for considering ways in which Evangelicals created literature—an “Evangelical Archive”—that formulated and maintained their conceptual unity both at home and with their missionaries and converts abroad. Aimed Benjamin Fischer at recruiting missionaries, encouraging believers, providing ethnology, and garnering support, mission narratives first emerged from the difficult mission context of China. The third chapter contrasts Evangelical representations of China with those by Thomas DeQuincey, Jesuit missionaries, and travel writers. Encoding spiritual terms for both spiritual and material subjects of attention, mission narratives assisted in coloring China as dark and depraved in opposition to Christianity's enlightening brightness. The fourth chapter examines the work of Charles Gutzlaff, Journal of Three Voyages , and demonstrates a shift in the Evangelical approach to both British culture and foreign peoples, and thus a refiguring of the relationship between mission and empire. The chapter also shows how the distribution of the Gospel in China and the circulation of Gutzlaff's writing in Britain provided justifications for the Opium War, while at the same time they revealed a growing division of opinion among Evangelicals regarding cooperation with commerce and government. The dissertation argues that the mission in China represents a shift in British thinking about mission and empire, which reflects the achievement of Evangelical hegemony in British culture.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Notre Dame,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, British and Irish literature, British, British trade, China, Cultural politics, Evangelical, Imperialist, Missionaries, Missions, Opium War, Religion",1,Notre Dame,Indiana,41.7014,-86.2378,United States
305305043,"Wetherell, Ann Elizabeth",Reading birds: Confucian imagery in the bird paintings of Shen Zhou (1427–1509),Modern,"Although the Ming Dynasty scholar-painter Shen Zhou (1427-1509) is best known for landscapes, flowers and birds account for one-quarter of his extant attributed paintings, yet have been largely overlooked in scholarship except for their stylistic qualities. This dissertation explores Shen Zhou's treatment of the subgenre of birds. He is the earliest and most prominent Ming literati painter to paint birds and the first to regularly inscribe them with a self-composed poem. Shen's paintings and poems draw upon a highly multivalent symbolic system, emerging in antiquity and accruing layers of meaning over time, that analogized the realm of birds to Confucian social class and symbolized Confucian moral and ethical values. This study focuses on four recurring bird themes in paintings by Shen Zhou. Images of chickens, waterfowl, rain-calling doves, and jackdaws first appeared in art between the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) and the Six Dynasties (220-589), though their function as poetic metaphors began in the Classic of Poetry from the 8-6 th centuries BCE. From their inception, these motifs indexed an array of metaphors that projected human experience and emotion onto birds. The history of the received tradition is provided in two chapters that trace vital artistic and thematic developments in bird imagery to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Though Shen's paintings reflect several models, the sense of close observation and expression of psychological awareness in the birds reflects the anthropomorphism of Song academic painting (960-1279). Two chapters discuss twelve bird paintings and poems by Shen Zhou. Shen's chickens, waterfowl, and rain-calling doves engage in literary allusions to Confucian official and poets continuing since the Han. The filial crow, however, reflects the artist's reintroduction of an earlier association that disappeared in art after the Han, yet continued in poetry through the Tang Dynasty (618-906). The author concludes that these paintings are self-referential images of Shen as the filial son, as the social and economic pressures of the fifteenth century necessitated a life spent caring for his aging parents. The self-sacrifice inherent in the theme of the filial crow conveyed both the burden of filial devotion and the artist's deep commitment to it.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Oregon,NA,NA,"Art history, Asian literature, History, Bird paintings, China, Confucian, Imagery, Shen, Zhou, Symbolism",9,Eugene,Oregon,44.0564,-123.1174,United States
1727457116,"Zhao, Mi",From singing girls to revolutionary artists: Reconstructing China's socialist past in the post-socialist era (1945 to the present),Contemporary,"My dissertation examines local practices and individual experiences in socialist China. I focus on two social categories, singing girls-turned-revolutionary artists and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cultural cadres who took charge of the socialist transformation of singing girls. Through conducting both oral history and archival research, I further investigate the politics of memory—the current reconfiguration of “Chinese socialism.” I ask two questions: (1) How were individuals transformed by and how did they actively respond to political and economic transformations? (2) How have individuals’ memories been affected by but also challenged the national narrative? Before the socialist transformation in the 1950s, singing girls sang stories to mostly male customers. Their identities were extremely ambiguous as popular entertainers and women of ill-repute. During the socialist transformation, these women were transformed into revolutionary artists, becoming both targets and agents of the state. Singing girls, however, were not simply stepping-stones in the state-building project. They had strong cultural and commercial influence because of their popular and often erotic images. In the early socialist era, their commercial power enabled these singing girls to negotiate with CCP leaders who had to navigate among Party political tasks and local economic difficulties. Today, these individuals who had been acculturated to see themselves as the narrator of “history” continuously craft a remembered self and a remembered socialist past shaped by their current concerns. Treating oral history as a process of identity and historical construction, I apply a critical analysis of competing narratives of state archives and individual oral accounts to investigate how individual narratives become public memories. To trace the process of memory construction, I have conducted follow-up interviews with former singing girls and CCP cadres. My dissertation contributes to the current studies of modern Chinese history on two understudied topics: (1) the market economy not only co-existed with the state planning system but also laid the financial foundation for local collectivization, and (2) both the Party and individuals deployed sexual politics in socialist transformation. Furthermore, it highlights the fluidity of memories in the making of national history and the need to subject oral history to critical analysis.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,University of Oregon,History,History,"Asian History, Theater History, Gender studies, Ccp cadre, Oral history, Politics of memory, Prc history, Qingdao tianjin, Singing girls",9,Eugene,Oregon,44.0564,-123.1174,United States
1841283953,"Yang, Shu",Grafted identities: Shrews and the new woman narrative in China (1910s-1960s),Contemporary,"My dissertation examines the unacknowledged role of negative female models from traditional literature in constructing the modern woman in China. It draws upon literary and historical sources to examine how modern cultural figures resuscitated and even redeemed qualities associated with traditional shrews in their perceptions and constructions of the new woman across the first half of the twentieth century. By linking the literary trope of the shrew, associated with imperial China, with the twentieth-century figure of the new woman, my work bridges the transition from the late-imperial to the modern era and foregrounds the late-imperial roots of Chinese modernization. The scope of my dissertation includes depictions of shrews/new women in literary texts, the press, theater, and public discourses from the Republican to the Socialist period. Although there exists a rich body of work on both traditional shrew literature and the new woman narrative, no one has addressed the confluence of the two in Chinese modernity. Scholars of late imperial Chinese literature have claimed that shrew literature disappeared when China entered the modern age. Studies on the new woman focus on specific social and cultural contexts during the different periods of modernizing China. few scholars have traced the effects that previous female types had on the new woman. My research reveals the importance of the traditional shrew in contributing to the construction and reception of the new woman, despite the radically changing ideologies of the twentieth century. As I argue, the feisty, rebellious modern women in her many guises as suffragette, sexual independent, and gender radical are female types grafted onto the violent, sexualized, and transgressive typologies of the traditional shrew. My research contributes to the studies of Chinese modernity and the representations of Chinese women. First, it bridges the artificial divide between modern and traditional studies of China and expands the debates about the nature of Chinese modernity. Second, it brings to light the underexamined constructions of the new woman as an empowered social actor through her genealogical connections to the traditional shrew. Third, it provides a methodology for rethinking the contested depiction of women in Chinese modernity.",2016,2016,Ph.D.,United States,University of Oregon,Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures,East Asian Languages,"Asian literature, Asian History, Literature, Womens studies, History, Female empowerment, New woman, Republican China, Shrew",9,Eugene,Oregon,44.0564,-123.1174,United States
305441159,"Clark, Anthony Eugene",Historian of the Orchid Terrace: Partisan polemics in Ban Gu's “Hanshu”,Ancient,"This study of Ban Gu's (A.D. 32–92) Hanshu has been inspired somewhat by Aristotle's assertion in his essay on poesy that history reveals details, whereas literature reveals the universal. Whether this assumption has held over the millennia is irrelevant. what is germane to the topic of this study is that in the West, history and literature have in large part been distinguished from each other. This dissertation begins with the assumption that Aristotle's distinctions between history and literature cannot be applied to ancient Chinese historiography, for early Chinese historical records qualify equally as both. Ban Gu states that, “The historian of the left [of the emperor] records speech, and the historian of the right records actions.” Thus, by the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220), the recording of history was mostly court-centered. Yet, the recorded speech and actions of the emperors do not accord well with Western expectations. they are occupied less with causality than with Confucian morality, less with truth than judgment and polemic. Furthermore, Chinese historiography is profoundly literary, often interspersed with essays and rhapsodies. Whereas many scholars of Ban Gu's work consider only the structure of his Hanshu or the history it records, this dissertation is a study of how Gu's work functioned within the court as a venue for political self-preservation and intellectual disputation. That is, Ban Gu used his writing to promulgate a novel political philosophy that would function to please the imperial family in order to protect his own professional interests. China's early philosophy of Heaven's Mandate was perhaps created as a philosophy of political legitimization. The early Zhou rulers claimed that Heaven gave its blessing to the most worthy (moral) man in the kingdom, who was thus sanctioned as ruler. This dissertation argues that Ban Gu's history contends that morality had little to do with Heaven's sanction. The Hanshu suggests that the Han dynasty was irrevocably blessed with Heaven's Mandate, regardless of moral behavior. That is, while previous dynastic rulers lost their kingdoms by “immorality,” Ban Gu presents a theory that allows the Liu ruling clan to remain enthroned despite its actions.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of Oregon,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Ban Gu, China, Hanshu, Historian, Partisan, Polemics",9,Eugene,Oregon,44.0564,-123.1174,United States

304395340,"McAllister, Susan Fleming",Between Romantic revolution and Victorian propriety: The cultural work of British missionary narratives,Contemporary,"My dissertation explores the intersection between popular literature and the narratives of British missionaries to China written between 1807 and 1907. In my Introduction, I show how these narratives have been generally excluded from the most prominent, recent postcolonial theory and have often been misrepresented by cultural critics. Addressing this exclusion and misrepresentation, I offer an alternative theoretical approach which resituates these narratives in their historical and literary contexts. I argue that the missionary narratives give valuable insight into the cultural anxieties produced by Evangelical foreign missions and British imperialism. I explore the cultural work these narratives performed, demonstrating how culture is reshaped when different discourses, in this case the religious and the secular, borrow subject matter, themes and literary devices from each other. Chapter Two explores the conflict between public vocation and private ministry as it is treated in George Eliot's Adam Bede, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Elizabeth Gaskell's Ruth through the literary figure of the missionary. These novelists borrowed the form of their novels from the missionaries. Their novels, I argue, are a secularized, domesticated version of the missionary narrative which the novelists to attract Evangelical readers and, at the same time, to protest the missionary movement. Chapters Three and Four examine the influence of Romanticism on missionaries to China. I explore how the missionary narratives reinvest the Romantic impulses of revolutionizing and journeying with a deep Evangelical fervor. The missionaries use Romantic images and literary motifs such as the revolutionary hero and the picturesque landscape to mobilize and gain support for the missionary movement in China. Chapter Five explores how missionary narratives register important points of cultural ambivalence in major and minor literary works of the period. I examine, more specifically, conflicting views about dress and its meaning in Victorian books of etiquette, Victorian novels and missionary narratives. The traditional Victorian view of dress was challenged both in theory and practice by missionaries who adopted Chinese dress. This debate points to an ambivalence within Victorian society about cultural and national identity in an environment of fervent British imperialism.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,University of Oregon,NA,NA,"British and Irish literature, Religious congregations, History, China",9,Eugene,Oregon,44.0564,-123.1174,United States
816426749,"Xia, Yun",Traitors to the Chinese race (hanjian): Political and cultural campaigns against collaborators during the Sino-Japanese War of 1937–1945,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines formal and popular campaigns against collaborators during the second Sino-Japanese war of 1937-1945, considering the role of these campaigns in the political struggles of the Nationalist (Guomindang) government, the interplay between discourses of law and morality, and the interactions of legal professionals, intellectuals, and commoners in the development of Chinese nationalism and anti-imperialism. During the Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese army occupied vast areas in China and sponsored puppet regimes at central and local levels in areas under its occupation. These regimes variously attracted, persuaded, or forced a large number of Chinese officials, intellectuals, and local elites to work in their administrations. The Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek, which was the central Chinese government since 1928, retreated to the inland city of Chongqing to organize resistance against Japan. The Nationalist government labeled collaborators as hanjian , traitors to the Han. The word became widely used in legal regulations, popular literature, and newspapers and became the most derogatory and politically disastrous title possible for a Chinese citizen. Individuals designated hanjian were exposed to public humiliation, confiscation of land and property, and the threat of assassination. Chiang Kai-shek's government also called for the common people to expose hanjian . Most such accusations were then transformed into legal procedures. These accusations resulted in varying and often unfair sentences. Designed by the Nationalist government to harness the force of popular nationalism and to restore justice, the anti- hanjian campaigns instead inadvertently exposed the corruption and incompetence of the Nationalist government and damaged the post-war construction effort.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Oregon,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, Law, Anti-hanjian campaigns, China, Chinese nationalism, Collaborator, Guomindang, Hanjian, Legal reform, Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945",9,Eugene,Oregon,44.0564,-123.1174,United States

The Chinese state wrestled with frontier problems simultaneously at almost every section of its land frontiers. In this context, Chinese (mostly Han) intellectuals voiced the slogan Go to the Frontier ( dao bianjiang qu ) and embarked on an avid examination of the frontier regions. They both traced China's historical geography as recorded in Chinese classics and traveled to frontier regions to investigate local conditions. A plethora of diverse frontier study societies and investigation teams sprang up, many of which established frontier-related journals. These journals proposed ways of developing the frontiers and better integrating them into the Chinese nation. Focusing on the Go to the Frontier movement, this study examines several salient features — politico-ideological, cultural, technological, and finally, scientific and disciplinary of Nationalist China's stretching of its skin to contain the vast frontier regions. Educated Han elites, facing the frontier crisis, reimagined China's position in Asian and global space, in accordance with both territorial nationalism and transnational ideologies, national and imperial practices. This study analyzes the language in which Chinese intellectuals and officials represented the frontiers, as well as the specific engineering projects that they developed to intervene in frontier regions. It ends by identifying the most important historical legacies of this movement. Because of substantial political and economic constraints, the Go to the Frontier movement could not fully accomplish the task of bringing all of the frontier regions under state control. To a certain extent, the slogan Go to the Frontier proved to be more illusory than practical. Nonetheless, the movement produced enduring rhetoric and a repertoire of approaches with regard to China's peripheral regions that would be influential and would connect the eras of the Republic of China (ROC, 1911-1949) and the People's Republic of China (PRC, 1949-present).

Han Chinese who migrated from western Fujian to Guangdong province in search of new economic opportunities over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these guest people challenged the economic control of earlier settlers in these provinces and thereby sparked some of the most violent struggles of late Qing China. I examine, in particular, how the participation of the guest people in a series of struggles, the Red Turban Rebellions (1854-1856) and the Hakka-Punti War (1856-1867) in the Pearl River Delta areas of South China, helped create among these people a distinct sense of identity, a sharp sense of their own, different, Hakka, ethnicity. My study is designed to provide a detailed historical analysis of the construction of Hakka identity. I focus on the whole network of different interests and relationships that led to the Red Turban Rebellions and the Hakka-Punti War of the mid-nineteenth century: the long-standing economic conflicts over land use. the part played by local gentry and lineage organizations in Hakka-Punti feuds. the role that the state, and most particularly local governments, played in intensifying existing tensions and thus drawing ethnic lines.

1728324352,"Anderson, Matthew McCutchen",Change and standardization in Anyang: Writing and culture in bronze age China,Ancient,"This dissertation is particularly concerned with various changes that occurred over roughly the last two centuries of the Shang period, that is, during the Anyang period, which stretches from approximately 1250 BCE to approximately 1050 BCE. This period, which begins just before the earliest evidence for writing in what is now China and stretches until the fall of the last Shang king, contains the entirety of the recorded history of the Shang dynasty. After discussing the dating of Shang oracle-bone inscriptions, I first address changes in Shang writing, demonstrating that it becomes increasingly regularized over the period. The earliest examples of Shang writing, especially those dating from the reign of king Wu Ding, show high levels of graphic and linguistic variation—that is, graphs/words are written differently from one inscription to the next, syntax is sometimes inconsistent, and aspects like text direction vary wildly. additionally, the semantic content of these inscriptions is far more diverse than is the case toward the end of the period. Using this apparent regularization as a backdrop, I address the Shang’s changing relationships with certain non-Shang peoples, especially those known as the fang -countries. Palaeographical materials are primarily drawn from the Shang, but later periods also provide useful examples of the kinds of processes at work, and I pay special attention to early examples of Chinese writing found outside Anyang. I focus on the newest collection of scientifically excavated Shang inscriptions, Yinxu Xiaotun cun zhong cun nan jiagu (Oracle bones from the center and south of Xiaotun village in the Wastes of Yin), published in 2012. Compared to other collections, relatively little work has been done on this one, and it happens to contain many inscriptions especially relevant to some of the questions under discussion, from issues of dating to the Shang’s relationships with other peoples. While other corpora of Shang oracle-bone inscriptions are also essential to this project, this newest collection is its foundation. The second part of this dissertation presents a transcription of the entire collection, together with a full English translation, its first ever into another language.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Ancient languages, Asian History, Asian Studies, Early china, Jiaguwen, Oracle-bone inscriptions, Palaeography, Shang, Writing",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
304821113,"Leung, Andrew K. Y.",The architecture of central -pillar cave in China and Central Asia: A typological study,Modern,"In this dissertation, I examine a specific cave type commonly known as the central-pillar cave, one of the most prominent types in the early development of Buddhist rock-cut architecture in China and Central Asia. In a comprehensive examination of this cave typology, my work concentrates on the regional differences in architectural style, conception, and function of the cave type, because the identification of regional architectural styles, their characteristics and their relationships, are essential first steps toward understanding the complex religious, social, and cultural environment of medieval Buddhist China and Central Asia. These inter-regional differences and similarities in architectural style are clearly related to religious practices. Local variations in theology can be identified through studies of iconography and Buddhist texts, yet a richer understanding of these variations and their significance greatly profits from a more nuanced understanding of the cave-temple typology. I argue that the existing typology of the central-pillar cave is in fact a problematic amalgamation of at least two distinct cave types---the true central-pillar cave type and what I refer to as the Kuchean-style shrine. While true central-pillar caves are found in China, the Kuchean-shrine is found exclusively in Chinese Central Asia. The misidentification of the Kuchean-style shrine is the result of a misreading of the architectural plan. In addition, most recently, a third group of previously unstudied cave temples from western Central Asia has also been conflated with the central-pillar cave type. This group of monuments is also discussed in this dissertation where it is seen as a separate type. My architectural analysis shows that all these so-called related cave temples are different architecturally and should not be considered a single cave typology. While there is little question that the tradition of Buddhist cave temple has its beginning in India, it is apparent that local adaptation of this architectural tradition has favored using an indigenous architectural vocabulary to create these cave temples to suit the religious needs of each geographical region.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Art history, Architecture, Architecture, Buddhism, Cave temples, Central Asia, Central-pillar cave, China",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
304975545,"Bradford, Rosalind E.",The Guyuan Sarcophagus: Motifs and explication,Ancient,"The fragments of painted lacquer which had covered a coffin and also bronze pushou were discovered in a tomb in Leizumiao Village, Guyuan (originally Gaoping, later Yuaanzhou), Ningxia, in 1981. Due to the close resemblance to the lacquer remains in a number of recently excavated fifth century Northern Wei tombs in Datong (Pingcheng), Shanxi, and the undeveloped nature of Gaoping before the sixth century, it is proposed that the Guyuan Sarcophagus was made in Pingcheng and transported to be used in Gaoping. The sarcophagus is covered with an intricate array of motifs. Compared to the remains of the Zhou Dynasty (ca. 1045-221 BCE), a great, and sudden, change can be seen in the artifacts of the Han Dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE). Han sources and some earlier ones explain much of the decoration on the Guyuan Sarcophagus. If no sign of the development of a motif had previously appeared, it is presumed that it may have entered China via the Silk Route which was coming into use in the Han and continued to grow thenceforth. Thus, a number of the motifs on the Guyuan Sarcophagus are traced to various regions of Eurasia. Included in these are vine scrolls from the Mediterranean, merlons from Iran, flaming shoulders and pearl roundels from Gandhāra, human-headed birds from Egypt, and the Sogdian ceremony of Nowruz. Other motifs were very much in the Chinese tradition including filial piety scenes, Xiwangmu and Dongwangfu, and the Heavenly River. These were combined on the same coffin with undeniably Buddhist figures and elements of the Sogdian Nowruz. All the above leads to speculation about the beliefs of the occupant and the possibility that the artist adhered more to traditional Han beliefs than did he. The occupant' s ultimate posthumous fate remains unknown.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Art history, Buddhist art, China, Gandhara, Guyuan Sarcophagus, Iran, Native Chinese religion, Northern Wei, Pingcheng period",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States

The tombs’ structures and the main theme of their pictorial programs, the Four Spirits (the Green Dragon, the Red Bird, the White Tiger, the Dark Warrior, and, sometimes, the Yellow Dragon), identify them as belonging to the late Goguryeo Kingdom (37 BCE-668 CE), one of the Korean Three Kingdoms. However, the interior decoration displays a multitude of regional variations making them unique among Goguryeo tombs with murals. Stylistically, the tomb paintings clearly belong to the sixth or early-seventh century. However, the main images and ideology the Ji'an murals represent can be traced to developments that occurred in Han China (202 BCE-220 CE) and demonstrate an affinity for and deep understanding of ancient Chinese mythology and cosmology. This study attempts to identify and analyze the myriad images within the three Ji'an Four Spirits tombs. This dissertation utilizes a variety of textual and visual sources. A combination of primary and secondary historical texts, both Korean and Chinese, are used to understand the period in which these tombs were created. Mythological and religious texts from the Zhou and Han periods of China are also important resources. concepts and creatures referred to in these texts permeated the funerary cultures of the later time periods, even on the Korean peninsula. In addition, funerary contracts and epitaphs as well as mirror inscriptions offer insight into the images found in the three Ji'an tombs. Mirrors are particularly important artifacts because, as portable objects, they demonstrate how images and concepts traveled to distant lands. Objects found in China, Korea, and Japan are evidence of the cultural interaction that the texts describe. Through these sources, many of the images within the three tombs can be identified. The imagery within the tombs can be interpreted as a symbolic recreation of the universe as well as aids for the deceased's ascension to the immortal realm.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Asian Studies, Art history, China, Five phases, Four Spirits, Funerary arts, Goguryeo, Goguryeo tombs, Ji'an, Korea, Tombs, Yin and yang",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
2350000000,"Yu, Leqi",Xia Yong and the Jiehua Traditions in Yuan China (1279–1368),Medieval,"This dissertation studies a unique painting genre and its traditions in fourteenth-century China. This genre, called jiehua, relies on tools such as rulers to accurately represent architectural details and structures. Such technical consideration and mechanical perfection link this painting category with the builder’s art and led to Chinese elites’ belittlement. Jiehua has held a highly significant yet barely studied position in the history of Chinese art. The limited scholarship that does exist concentrates on the Song and Qing dynasties, while the significance of the Yuan dynasty, the period of Mongolian rule, has been downplayed. However, Yuan artists left us numerous jiehua and carried the genre to extremes of technical virtuosity. This dissertation is based primarily on visual materials, particularly those of the professional painter Xia Yong (14th c.), to investigate the Mongol Yuan’s unique role in China’s jiehua history. The first chapter clarifies four historical interpretations of the evolving concept jiehua. Then, through a literary review of the famous scroll Going up the River on the Qingming Festival, this chapter analyzes existing problems in the study of jiehua, namely the complex relations between artistic realism and reality, between the painter and society, and between jiehua and landscape painting. The following chapters both focus on a case study of Xia Yong’s paintings to deal with these problems. The second chapter looks in detail at Xia’s Yellow Pavilion paintings (often mistakenly treated as Yellow Crane Tower paintings) to determine whether his two-dimensional jiehua images represent contemporary three-dimensional buildings. It aims to show that the apparent realism of Xia’s jiehua derives from a modular system related to the transmission of models, rather than the mimesis of real architecture. The third chapter compares Xia’s Prince Teng Pavilion paintings with two other works of the same theme, which were separately attributed to Wang Zhenpeng (ca. 1275–1330) and Tang Di (1287–1355). It examines the technical innovation in Yuan jiehua (particularly its plain-drawing style), as well as its relationship to the Northern Song Li-Guo landscape tradition. Meanwhile, this chapter combines detailed visual analyses with a social-historical approach and explores whether the Mongol artistic patronage helped shape the mainstream of jiehua at the Yuan court.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Architectural painting, Jiehua, Yong, Xia, Yuan dynasty,",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
305144169,"Hsu, Hsin-Mei Agnes",Pictorial eulogies in three Eastern Han tombs,Ancient,"In light of the more recently excavated evidence and advancements in archaeological research, it is necessary to look again at the three Eastern Han tombs at Wangdu and Anping that were discovered more than thirty years ago in central Hebei province. While these tombs are geographically close and share some similarities, there are significant differences in pictorial program, grave goods, and tomb structures. Reexamination of previous scholarship on the excavated material offers new information that challenges preexisting views of aspects of Eastern Han society, such as art, literature, religion, and material culture of the elite in first- and second-century C.E. China. This project also seeks to interpret funerary wall paintings from an emic perspective and to study the development and innovations of this art form in Eastern Han using the three tombs as primary case studies. The biographical nature of the subjects of the wall paintings indicates that they are intended as pictorial eulogies and expressions of individualism in an age of conformity. As pictorial eulogies, they give us a rare view into the private life of the Eastern Han elite. Similarly, the selection of grave goods shows an emphasis on representations of personal achievements and predilections. Identification of the incumbents of the three tombs becomes possible at the conclusion of a closer examination of the material, pictorial, and historical evidence.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"Art History, Archaeology, History, China, Eastern Han, Funerary wall paintings, Pictorial eulogies, Tombs",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
304613481,"Miller, Tracy Gay",Constructing religion: Song dynasty architecture and the Jinci temple complex,Medieval,"This dissertation addresses the buildings within the Jinci temple complex both as a case study in early building style and as evidence for local religious practice. In Part I, I assess the date of the primary temple building at Jinci, the Sage Mother Hall. I do this first by comparing the building to the Northern Song building manual the Yingzao fashi in order to review the current methodology of dating traditional buildings. Then I compare the bracketing style and structural features of the Sage Mother Hall to buildings of similar date in southern Shanxi province. By establishing a stylistic chronology within the southern Shanxi region, I show that the Sage Mother Hall is not a tenth century building, rather it is stylistically from the end of the eleventh century and should be given a date range of 1038–1102. In Part II, I examine the architecture of the temple complex in relation to local religion. The distribution of temple buildings at Jinci reveals both how local people conceived of their divinities, and how over time the temple buildings themselves affected later generations' interpretation of the site. The architectural language of traditional Chinese ritual sites used by elite and common patrons alike reveals aspects of local religious belief systems which were obfuscated by the elite authors of textual sources.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"Art History, Architecture, Religious history, History, Architecture, China, Jinci, Religion, Song dynasty, Temple complex",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
304714093,"Kim, Haewon",Unnatural mountains: Meaning of Buddhist landscape in the Precious Rain bianxiang in Mogao Cave 321,Pre-modern,"This dissertation explores a new way of looking at landscape depiction in Buddhist painting during the Tang dynasty (618–907). The materials are landscape features that appear as the background of the sutra illustrations called “ bianxiang (transformation tableau)” in the Dunhuang Mogao Caves in northwestern China. They have long been subjected to the formalistic approach and linear historical perspective, and little attention has been paid to their symbolic meaning and function. This study attempts to show their iconological aspect as a means to make a substantial criticism on the monolithic presence of the modern view of landscape painting and its anachronistic imposition on pre-modern examples. This investigation is formulated as a case study on a painting dated as late seventh century, the Precious Rain bianxiang in Cave 321. The painting has the most elaborate landscape depiction among contemporary bianxiang and is associated with the dynamic historical events around the political empowerment of Wu Zetian (r. 684–705), the only female emperor in China's history. The study includes careful observation on the formal and stylistic aspects of the painting and its landscape background, and relates them with the main themes and landscape references in the sūtra, along with the historical circumstances of the period, to draw religious and political meanings of landscape. My conclusion is that the landscape background in this painting played a most significant and effective role in conveying the religious and political messages of the painting. The title of the dissertation “Unnatural Mountains” refers to the two major points that this study is trying to make: (1)&#xa0.mountain landscape in the painting is not a direct transcription of the world but rather a sign embedded with meanings created within its religious and political contexts (2)&#xa0.illusory mountains in the painting is an imperial symbol of Wu Zetian that accords with her unique and unconventional political position as the only female emperor in China's history.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Buddhist, China, Dunhuang Mogao Caves, Iconography, Landscape, Painting, Tang dynasty",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
3480000055,"Figueroa, William A.","China and the Iranian Left: Transnational Networks of Social, Cultural, and Ideological Exchange, 1905–1979",Contemporary,"This study surveys the history of Sino-Iranian relations from the early 20th century to the Islamic Republic, focused on the impact of Chinese politics on the Iranian left. At the beginning of the 20th century, traditional ties were replaced by new colonial networks of transportation and communication throughout Asia. News of the Iranian constitutional revolution quickly reached China and was debated by constitutionalists and colonialists in the pages of Shanghai-based newspapers. Competition and cooperation between Iran and the Republic of China emerged at the League of Nations in the 1920s and 1930s. Parallel to these ties, a robust, informal network emerged between the Tudeh Party, Iran’s pre-eminent Communist organization, and the Chinese Communist Party after 1949. The success of the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1949 helped inspire a more radical, internationalist approach to politics in Iran. Iranian youth increasingly saw themselves as part of a global community of oppressed nations. Many on the left, both secular and Islamic, studied Chinese texts and drew on Maoist theories to analyze Iran and international politics. China directly participated in and encouraged these developments, first by public support for the Tudeh Party, and later with clandestine support for an explicitly Maoist splinter group, the Revolutionary Organization of the Tudeh Party. This approach fills a gap in the existing scholarship of Sino-Iranian relations, which concentrates on elite interactions post-1979, by pushing back the timeline and foregrounding a set of unofficial connections typically relegated to margins of the historiography. It also emphasizes the global origins of the Iranian revolution and the international context in which it developed. The tangled relationship between the Chinese state, the Iranian state, and the Iranian opposition reveals a complex and sometimes controversial historical reality that is often glossed over by modern narratives of perpetual friendship and mutual co-operation. It rests on an analysis of primary sources in Mandarin and Persian, including Chinese media outlets, published interviews and travelogues from Iranians who went to China, Persian periodicals, and oral interviews.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,History,History,"China, Cold War, Iran, Maoism, Sino-Iranian relations, Tudeh Party,",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
2050000008,"Zhou, Yi",Yipu: History and Perception of a Suzhou Garden and Its Modernist Legacy,Contemporary,"This dissertation investigates the Suzhou garden Yipu through a close examination of its history, perception, and modernist legacy. Through delving into all the available textual and pictorial materials including local gazetteers, literati essays, poems, paintings, epigraphic records, pre-modern travel guides, street names, and on-site observations, the first chapter periodizes Yipu’s history into five phases according to its physical transformation, and reconstructs the layout for each phase. Such examination breaks the bulky history of Yipu into small sections that allow details of its vicissitude such as periphery shrinkages, changes of its urban environment, additions and repairs of buildings and garden elements coming into the discussion. It reveals that the area of Yipu was greatly reduced during the first thirty years of the fourth phase, giving rise to its current configuration. The long-believed statement that Yipu’s current configuration reveals the characteristics of a late Ming garden, the consensus view of most of previous scholarship, is thereby challenged. The second chapter examines how Yipu has been understood, conceived, imagined, and recreated by its owners, visitors, Suzhou citizens, and architecture critics, and further periodizes this long-neglected history into another four phases. I also emphasize that this part of the history of a garden should be equally treated in importance as its physical history, because it is to a great extent the real source of garden theory. Building on the discussion in Chapter Two of Yipu’s perception during its latest phase, the third chapter explores the role Yipu and how the study of the Chinese garden played in China’s architectural modernization. Through a detailed comparison with the role of the residence-garden Katsura in Kyoto and an investigation of the role of Japanese dwellings in Japan’s architectural modernization, this dissertation identifies some of the historical reasons and difficulties that hindered the revival of a distinctively Chinese tradition of modern architecture during the second half of the 20th century, and China’s active participation in developments in world architecture. I discuss the most influential individuals, including architects, architectural historians, educators and discipline founders, and multiple key events that determined the contrasting directions of China and Japan’s architectural modernization.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Communication and the arts, Social sciences, Architectural modernization of China, Chinese garden, Garden history, Katsura, Yipu,",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
2050000006,"Niu, Gabrielle J.",Beyond Silk: A Re-Evaluation of Jin Painting (1115 - 1234),Medieval,"This dissertation is a study of painting from China’s Jin dynasty (1115 – 1234). It presents a systematic analysis of painted works on silk, paper, and temple and tomb walls. Although the Jin dynasty lasted for 119 years, Jin painting is treated often as a footnote to the more highly revered painting of the Northern and Southern Song dynasties (960 – 1279). This marginalization is largely due to the lack of paintings on silk and paper which traditionally form the core of Chinese painting history, and is compounded further by the fact that the Jin was ruled by an ethnically non-Han group, the Jurchen. This dissertation establishes Jin painting as its own cultural phenomenon and seeks an understanding of Jin painting beyond silk. First, the dissertation suggests that in order to grasp the richness and diversity of Jin painting history, we must examine the interfaces between different painting contexts and cultures. Second, this dissertation proposes an alternate framework for understanding Jin painting based on geographic regions and centers of painting culture, rather than dynastic chronology. These arguments are outlined in four chapters The first chapter addresses paintings on silk and paper and brings together a core group of Jin landscape paintings. The second chapter examines tomb murals and how northern funerary painting traditions were preserved and permutated in Jin China. The third chapter examines the twelfth century temple hall murals at Yanshansi and highlights the murals’ place as a crossroads between regional painting idioms and courtly painting. Finally, the fourth chapter examines landscape murals from Yulin Cave 3 created under the Xia state (1038 – 1227) and suggests that there was a shared visual culture in twelfth-to-thirteenth-century north and northwestern China. This shared visual culture allows Jin and Xia painting to be viewed within a framework that does not revolve around the dichotomy of Northern and Southern Song court and literati painting. In doing so, this dissertation situates Jin painters as central, active participants in Chinese painting history and demonstrates the flourishing of painting beyond silk and paper under Jurchen rule.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Communication and the arts, Social sciences, China, Chinese painting, Jin dynasty,",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
4030000066,"Weng, Chuanxin",Representing Guizhou: Imagery from Ming (1368-1644) to the Modern Era,Modern,"This dissertation focuses on three painters who represented Guizhou Province at three different times from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries. Through their lives, the landscape that inspired them, and textual sources one has a rare glimpse at interpretations of space, historic memory, and politics in a region of China’s southwestern frontier. The first chapter addresses the only three surviving paintings attributed to Huang Xiangjian 黃向堅 (1609-1673) with Iron-Chain Bridge as a subject. While providing explanations for the spurious authenticity of an album leaf in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, this chapter investigates the ways in which this leaf was reproduced. The gazetteer Tieqiao zhishu 鐵橋志書 (Record of Iron-Chain Bridge), published in 1665, includes illustrations of Panjiang that show convincing link to the leaf, attesting to the circulation and exchange of images and knowledge about the Iron-Chain Bridge. Chapter two discusses Landscape Contemplating Me, an album painted around 1743 by Zou Yigui 鄒一桂 (1686-1772). Following detailed readings of the twenty-two leaves and their inscriptions, the chapter surveys the established sets of jing 景 (scenery) in five Guizhou gazetteers from Ming (1368-1644) to Qing (1644-1912). Consulting Ming route books, the chapter then argues that the postal routes informed the selection of the views in Landscape Contemplating Me. Discerning disjunctions between album leaves and gazetteer representations of the same locations, the chapter argues that politics operates in the absence of images. Chapter three presents a Guizhou native, Meng Guangtao 孟光濤 (1917-1987), who is deemed “the Founder of Modern Guizhou Landscape Painting.” Meng’s depictions of Guizhou are distinguished by an underlying modernist agenda. Considering his paintings about railway construction, the Long March (1934-1936), and the habitats of ethnic groups, this chapter showcases a modern vision of Guizhou which is inextricably intertwined with the tumultuous shifts in society and politics in twentieth-century China.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,East Asian Languages and Civilizations,East Asian Studies,"Frontier, Guizhou, Xiangjian, Huang, Landscape, Guangtao, Meng, Yigui, Zou,",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
304504570,"Wang, Chen-shan","Quanzhou Kaiyuan Monastery: Architecture, iconography and social contexts",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the iconography and architecture of Kaiyuan Monastery (KYS) in Quanzhou in relation to its social context. By studying its evolution, the dissertation provides valuable information about the order of space that creates the special relation between function and social meaning in buildings. The historical research relies heavily on the monastery gazetteer, Kaiyuan sizhi , local gazetteers and epigraphs. KYS has had several renovations and numerous repairs since its foundation in the Tang dynasty. Along with the study of its architectural history, this dissertation explores the importance of the monks and donors who together have reshaped the monastery from time to time. Through examining its five major buildings—ordination hall, two pagodas, main hall and Tanyue ci, this dissertation demonstrates that the evolution of the iconography and architecture has been linked to Buddhist doctrines, political situations and social development. The ordination hall, for example, was rebuilt in order to follow Daoxuan's plan. Quanzhou, as an international seaport in the Song and Yuan, its multi-cultures and multi-religions are reflected on the iconography and architecture of KYS. The Brahmanical elements found in KYS and elsewhere in Quanzhou indicate a multicultural fusion in society. Nevertheless, the structure of the two stone pagodas and other Song buildings in Fujian, similar to the chu-shim-po-jak style in Korea and the Daibutsuyō in Japan, suggests the intimate relationships between these countries.

304614288,"Yang, Jidong",Writing in the Tang: Literature and society in 7–10th century China,Medieval,"The study of the social contexts and implications of traditional Chinese literature in the Tang period (618–907) is not a new trend. However, most scholarly attention has heretofore exclusively focused on the works of best known Tang writers. Little effort has been made to explain how literary writings became an inherent component of the basic structure of Tang society and contributed to the legitimization and consolidation of a certain social order. Using a variety of primary sources such as dynastic histories, anecdotes, epitaphs, literary compositions in various genres, and excavated medieval Chinese manuscripts, this dissertation attempts to systematically reconstruct the changing social contexts in which Tang literati grew, learned, communicated, and wrote to fulfill their social duties and to achieve social success. After observing the development of relevant industries and institutions, I propose that there was a cultural augmentation in the Tang period which was characterized by the significantly increasing availability and accessibility of writing materials, the expansion of educational institutions of various types cross the country, and the rising level of public literacy. Meanwhile the format, language, and techniques of literary writing ( wenzhang ) in medieval Chinese terminology, had matured and been accepted by the entire elite class. As the demand for literary texts from every level of Tang society, including the family, local community, and state, was fast growing, literary writing became the most official and orthodox medium of textual communication. This in turn brought about a widespread obsession with literature among Tang literati and greatly influenced the invention and evolution of the Civil Service Examinations, including both keju and quanxuan . By the end of the Tang dynasty, literary writing had finally replaced social pedigree as the most important means and measure of social success. In addition to providing an infrastructure of dealing with the relationship between literature and society, this dissertation investigates a number of related issues critical to a better understanding of medieval Chinese culture, such as the dichotomy of Confucian learning and literary writing, the curriculum of Tang schools, and the literary nature of government documents.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, China, Literature, Seventh century, Society, Tang dynasty, Tenth century, Writing",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
858352507,"Harrer, Alexandra",Fan-shaped bracket sets and their application in religious timber architecture of Shanxi province,Contemporary,"The dissertation challenges one of the most distinctive features in traditional Chinese architecture, the bracket set known as dougong , and discusses diverging stylistic variations that actually existed in Shanxi province between the eleventh and nineteenth centuries against the background of official-style building. The key challenge was to see beyond the long lasting stereotypes in China that did not allow full acknowledgement of the wide range of corbelled clusters with bracket-arms projecting at acute or obtuse angles to the wall plane i.e. xiegong , and the importance of such non-conformity. The scope of research was limited to the extant pool of timber structures in Shanxi officially designated as key national heritage conservation units between 1961 and 2006.

908432123,"Campbell, Aurelia",The impact of imperial and local patronage on early Ming temples at the Sino-Tibetan frontier,Modern,"This dissertation concerns the architecture and material culture of a group of littleknown early Ming dynasty (1368–1644) Tibetan Buddhist temples along the border of present-day Gansu and Qinghai provinces at the Sino-Tibetan frontier. Investigated together, these temples are our most complete historical records of activity between the imperial capital and the northwestern periphery during the early Ming. They provide important new material for examining long-standing issues central to the field of Chinese art history regarding the dynamics among patronage, politics, and style. Drawing upon close readings of on-site inscriptions and detailed architectural analyses, I address three major problems. First, why did Ming emperors patronize monuments at the Sino-Tibetan frontier? Second, how did craftsmen, ideas, and practices move across political and cultural boundaries during this time? Third, how did these buildings meet the religious and practical demands of their immediate environment? I argue that architecturally these temples need to be understood within two different contexts: (1) as case studies in the stylistic effects of two contrasting types of patronage, imperial and local, and (2) as evidence of an early regional style that blends together traditional Chinese, Tibetan, and vernacular architectural forms. By bringing much needed academic attention to the architecture of the Ming dynasty, my dissertation makes an important contribution to scholarship on China’s architectural history.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, Art history, Architecture, China, Ming dynasty, Patronage, Qutan Monastery",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
304491293,"Kim, Sung Shin",Manipulating fate: ming in Chinese political culture,Modern,"My work mainly focuses on the use of ming in political texts and contexts to see its functioning in political situations where legitimacy was at stake. The foundations for this could be found in the major source on political ming , the Book of Documents . In my reading of the Documents , I single out key characteristics of ming . First of all, the delegation of authority it implied as well as the role accorded to the people. Considering those aspects, ming is shown as a political theory dealing with the innate brokenness of political reality. Two other aspects of ming as a system to manage change are drawn from separate case studies, which show how Chinese political culture referred back to the classics, and in particular the Documents . The first is the need for verification that one was truly the holder of ming . This is shown in what I identify as a 'parody' of legitimation: Ban Gu's history of the usurpation of Wang Mang. The management of change becomes only clear if this is read as a caricature which magnifies elements that are actually inherent to ming . Ming was the centre not only of a theory of legitimacy, but also of history. The second case study shows ming was conceived as an entity in time. I look at one of the last instances the Mandate of Heaven was publicly claimed, not in China but by Kojong of Korea. This foreign, marginal setting makes it easier to grasp the deliberateness and originality of the use of the political instrument ming . While earlier studies have interpreted this episode as an instance of conservative official nationalism, I show how it was actually part of, or at least consciously harked back to an older tradition of the reinterpretation of Chinese political thought in Choso˘˘n Korea. Neither was it conservative from a world historical perspective, since the court tried to position Korea as an independent state by proclaiming the king as emperor and holder of the mandate. King Kojong's proclamation as Emperor shows most clearly that the political ming did not necessarily have to imply stagnation.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, Book of Documents, China, Korea, Korean empire, Legitimacy-China and Korea-Ancient and modern, Mandate of Heaven, Ming, Political culture",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States

305406014,"Gadsden, Amy Epstein",Building the rule of law in early twentieth-century China (1905–1926),Contemporary,"In the last years of the Qing empire, China undertook several major steps toward reforming its legal system in accordance with Western legal practices. Legal reform was part of a larger program of late Qing liberalization, but it also was needed to convince the foreign powers to relinquish extraterritoriality. When the Republic was founded in 1912, legal construction was accelerated. Initially, reformers concentrated their efforts on creating new institutions, such as courts, laws, legal personnel, and prisons. As these institutions began to operate, new principles emerged as Chinese courts and legal specialists wrestled with how to reconcile traditional and new laws and practices. At the Chinese Supreme Court, justices were engaged in articulating these new principles and carving out a role for China's infant judiciary as a source of authority and power. In the fall of 1922, China's reformed jurists confronted government authorities in Beijing for unfairly arresting Cabinet Member Luo Wengan. Luo himself demanded a full investigation and trial, refusing to leave prison until the legal process had run its course. These actions indicate that reform of the legal system had moved from building new courts and appointing judges to the beginnings of fundamental change of Chinese legal culture. But failure to achieve political stability in the early 1920s undermined these nascent reform efforts. When foreign representatives convened in Beijing in 1926 to assess changes in the legal system, they acknowledged that major institutional changes had taken place. Ultimately, however, they refused to relinquish extraterritoriality until China took additional steps to improve the administration of justice, especially with regard to the elimination of civil and military interference in the legal system. In the end, two decades of legal reform had fundamentally changed the system, but rule of law remained elusive. In the absence of good governance, only limited legal reform could be achieved. Nevertheless, republican reformers showed great potential for steering China down a new legal road. The foundations they laid are still relevant today, as are the problems they faced.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, China, Extraterritoriality, Legal reform, Rule of law, Twentieth century",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States

It describes how this Muslim borderland between Central Asia and China became today’s Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture under the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Three Districts had been in the Soviet sphere of influence since the 1930s and remained so even after the Chinese Communist takeover in October 1949. After the Sino-Soviet split in the late 1950s, Beijing transformed a fragile suzerainty into full sovereignty over this region: the transitional population in Xinjiang was demarcated, border defenses were established, and Soviet consulates were forced to withdraw. As a result, the Three Districts changed from a Soviet frontier to a Chinese one, and Xinjiang’s outward focus moved from Soviet Central Asia to China proper. The largely peaceful integration of Xinjiang into PRC China stands in stark contrast to what occurred in Outer Mongolia and Tibet. Previous scholarship has attributed this to many factors, such as the flexibility of CCP’s ethnic and frontier policies, the success of local party building and cadre recruitment system, the use of military power, and mass migrations of Han people to Xinjiang. While these studies broke new ground, the scarcity of archival documents weakened their arguments. By taking advantage of documents from Xinjiang local archives, the Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, as well as the Russian archives recently made available, this study demonstrates that rather than implementing exceptional social policies in Xinjiang, the CCP excelled at strategic negotiation with the USSR, greatly aiding their bid for power.

Thinking of that the texts of historical narrations should be also available examples of print-capital and are usually far more influential in the process of nation-making in formerly Chinese communities, this dissertation focuses on some representative texts of Taiwanese general history and concentrates on the ethnic imaginations behind the contexts of those the narrations of Taiwanese history. The development of the Taiwanese historiography of Taiwanese history was a process of whereby Taiwanese's historians reconstructing deconstructed and then deconstructing reconstructed Chinese orthodox historiography in the historical narrations of Taiweanese history. However, the deconstruction did not eliminate the debate over legitimacy, which is still interpreted to serve various political agendas. Thus, historical narrations are still instrumentalized to serve politics. Through these changing narrations, the Taiwanese recomprehend or redefine both their own identities and their conception of China. Here are the conclusion: (1) During the process of historiographical transformation, the discourse about legitimacy or orthodox legitimacy is usually the main concern of Taiwanese historical narration. (2) The transformation of Taiwanese subjective identity mirrors Taiwan's evolution from a regional entity to a national entity.

304450590,"Howard, Paul Wilson","Opium suppression in Qing China: Responses to a social problem, 1729-1906",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores the complex history of opium suppression during the Qing dynasty. Going beyond our understanding of the Opium War and opium trade, both of which in past decades have received considerable scholarly attention in the West, I examine the social construction of what would eventually be called the opium problem (yapian wenti) and the range of responses to it during a roughly one hundred seventy-five year period. This period was characterized by the centuries-old legacy of medicinal consumption of opium as a medicinal drug, the legislation of government opposition to the smoking of opium beginning in 1729, the rise of the import and domestic opium trades from the late eighteenth through the nineteenth century, the dramatic increase in the number of opium smokers that attended the surge in native production, and the emergence at various levels of Chinese society of a contentious discourse about opium. Westerners living in China during this period, particularly missionaries, played a significant role in influencing the debate over how to respond to the threat posed by the drug. However, reform-minded Chinese officials, non-bureaucratic elites, and other Chinese throughout the country created their own vision of a society freed of the opium poison, and in so doing these reformers revealed how traditional values about morality, health, and social order were changing to suit the needs of a China experiencing the rise of incipient nationalism. By 1906, the year the Qing government launched its full-scale opium suppression campaign, the opium issue had become for many living under the Manchu regime a symbol of the nation's political and social ills. For such socially conscious Chinese, the solution would be as imperative as the ending of extraterritoriality and the recovery of railway rights if China was ever to become a strong, healthy, and independent nation. Although the Opium Suppression Campaign ultimately fell victim to entrenched economic interests and the political upheaval of the Warlord Era, the anti-opium movement fostered the expression of a national consensus that helped mobilize the forces of social reform.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, China, Opium suppression, Qing Dynasty",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
304833320,"Sun, Xiaochun","State and science: Scientific innovations in Northern Song China, 960–1127",Medieval,"This dissertation studies how science was related to the Northern Song state in 10th- through 12th-century China. It investigates how the development of sciences differed from each other depending on their relevance to the governance of imperial state. It focuses on three Chinese sciences: astronomy, medicine and alchemy. They were related to the aims of the imperial government in different ways so that they present different pictures of development during the period. Astronomy was politically important to the imperial state because a good astronomical system indicated the legitimacy of rule and symbolized good governance. This political relevance made astronomy a state enterprise. Astronomy received sustained organizational and financial support from the Northern Song imperial government. This accounts for the many achievements during the period. Medicine experienced unprecedented development when the Northern Song rulers and government came to regard medicine as embodying benevolent governance. The Northern Song government showed remarkable activism in both production and dissemination of medical knowledge. The active involvement of scholar-officials also helped shape the development of medicine during the period. The government treated astronomy and medicine in different ways. On the one hand, astronomy was seen as a sort of secret science of unique political interest to the imperial ruler, meticulously monopolized by the imperial government. This monopoly had its negative impact on astronomy. The changes were often limited within the conventional framework. The government would not support a daring research agenda that fell outside the political needs of the imperial state. Medicine, on the other hand, was broadly encouraged in its study. The government spread medical knowledge as widely as possible, as part of the agenda of empire-building. Alchemy, however, was in stark contrast to astronomy and medicine in its relation to the state. Being regarded as an occult knowledge that belonged to the realm of self-cultivation, it hardly received any subsidy from the imperial government. This absence of regular governmental support caused alchemy to stagnate, and to shift its focus from external alchemy to internal alchemy, which was not so much affected by governmental support.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, Astronomy, China, Imperial state, Medicine, Northern Song China, Scientific innovations, Song dynasty",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
816088950,"Baldanza, Kathlene",The ambiguous border: Early modern Sino-Viet relations,Ancient,"My dissertation uses Chinese relations with the Mac dynasty (1527-1677) of Vietnam as a window into the workings of the Chinese state, administration of the borderlands, and the interaction of foreign policy and cultural representation in late imperial China. During the sixteenth century, massive changes to Vietnamese government and society and the attendant upheaval forced the Chinese government to re-evaluate and re-formulate its relationship with its southern neighbor. Drawing on historical precedent and a body of ethnographic knowledge, officials of the Chinese Ming dynasty debated whether Vietnam was under Chinese jurisdiction or a foreign state beyond the pale. At stake in this debate was not only the fate of several border wards and the demarcation of a political and cultural border, but also the very definition of China and its role as a world power. To move beyond the familiar framework of the tributary system, this project supplements the accounts of official histories and government documents from both China and Vietnam with unofficial histories, diaries, and gazetteers. My dissertation shows that there was ample room within the tributary framework for debate, negotiation and flexibility. In contrast to research that likens Chinese imperialism to Western imperialism, I argue that Chinese governments were less interested in converting or civilizing non-Chinese than they were in determining and classifying those who were already acculturated into the Chinese empire. This process was complicated by the existence of an extensive borderlands separating the two states. In the borderlands, imperial projections met local realities and fell apart. Ultimately, the Ming government reached a compromise with the Mac, leaving the Vietnam crisis for their successor state, the Qing, to resolve. Although the Qing reneged their support of the Mac, their Vietnam policy contains many unnoted continuities with that of the Ming.

595124387,"Yang, Soon-Ja",The secular foundation of rulership: The political thought of Han Feizi (ca. 280–233 BC) and his predecessors,Ancient,"This dissertation examines the popular view of four thinkers in Chinese Warring States period: Shen Dao, Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, and Han Feizi. They have been classified as Fajia. Specifically, Han Feizi has been known as a synthesizer of his predecessors on the basis of their three major tenets, Shang Yang's fa (written penal laws to regulate the people), Shen Buhai's shu (techniques to manipulate ministers), and Shen Dao's shi (power or authority). The first half part of this dissertation deals with three forerunners of Han Feizi in order to explore whether shi, shu, and fa are the major tenets of Shen Dao, Shen Buhai, and Shang Yang respectively by analyzing overlooked sources such as fragments of their work. My examination shows that the conventional view has no solid textual basis. Shen Dao stresses the idea of fa rather than shi . Shen Buhai discusses fa instead of shu. In addition, I analyze Shang Yang's theory of fa from the perspective of the relationship between law and utilitarianism, in which agriculture and war are the main tools to accelerate the interests of a state. In other words, fa is the most critical issue in the view of these three thinkers. it means a standard of rewards and punishments, which thus can be rendered as laws. The second part of this dissertation discusses Han Feizi's own thought and interprets him from a different perspective, not as a synthesizer of the Fajia group. His main concern is how a ruler controls powerful ministers and strengthens his authority by means of fa along with li (ritual propriety). In the process, the term fa in Han Feizi's work is used in two connotations: laws and administrative regulations. That is, Han Feizi adopts the term fa in the same way as his predecessors on the one hand, but expands it into a wide-ranging concept of sociopolitical regulation on the other. Han Feizi shares a concern with his predecessors, which is the establishment of a ruler-centered government by means of fa, but exposes himself to vibrant intellectual environments of the Warring States period.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, Law, Political science, China, Chinese legalists, Han, Feizi, Rulership, Shang, Yang, Shen, Buhai, Shen, Dao",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States

By examining how Western languages and ideas influenced the native social life in the treaty port of Shanghai, I wish to demonstrate how language transformation became one of the historical stimuli that shaped a new linguistic landscape of the city. My dissertation investigates how English was circulated among different groups of local people in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Shanghai, and what cultural consequences a foreign language brought to a treaty port society. I have divided chapters according to the two circulation methods, i.e. , orality and literacy. In the first part, I focus on ordinary people's oral and visual English throughout their daily practices, and examine how English in an oral-visual format became embedded in the social activities of local Chinese. In the second part, I cover how dictionaries and reference books as materials for the study of English proliferated. By addressing the subjects of authorship, readership, and the market for English study together, I also try to explore how the business of text making and publishing became more and more professional, which led to a wide range of professionazation of English study toward the mid-twentieth century. My research indicates that English was a cultural phenomenon rather than an academic subject when it entered Shanghai in the mid-nineteenth century. During the second half of the nineteenth century, materials for the study of standard English emerged, which made the learning of English evolve into a professional stage. In as much as English was incorporated into the city's new cultural landscape toward the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, its linguistic identity was transformed by being transcribed into Chinese and thus, English turned into part of local people's vernacular repertoire.

304613370,"Brose, Michael Carl",Strategies of survival: Uyghur elites in Yuan and early -Ming China,Medieval,"An important component of the Mongol empire that emerged after 1206 were the personnel recruited from Central and West Asia who submitted to or were conquered by the Mongols. These men (known in Mongol China as “ semuren ”) served as advisors and tutors to the Mongol elites, and as administrators and technicians in the sedentary societies conquered by the Mongols, and they constituted a distinctive group in Yuan China. Considerable scholarship has been devoted to prominent individual semuren , but few studies have attempted to study the semuren diachronically, as a class across the entire Yuan dynasty. This dissertation addresses this lacunae. it examines one prominent family of semuren , the Uyghur Xie family, from the time they entered China in the early 13 th century through the first decades of the Ming dynasty. The Xie family were aristocratic elites in their homeland, and they successfully integrated first into the Mongol political hierarchy, and eventually also into southeast China as social elites. Their story provides a window onto the strategies that many semuren used to retain their identities as political and social elites after their dispersal from their homelands by the Mongols. A wide variety of sources (official biographies, entries in gazetteers, essays and poems written in their honor by semuren and Chinese contemporaries, and materials written by Xie family members themselves) are used to study the Xie family's strategies of survival as elites. The sources reveal members of the Xie family used their cultural capital as multi-literate, educated persons to integrate into the Mongol realm as political elites. Within three generations, Xie family members were also participating in Chinese literati activities, and had become accepted as members of the social elite in a community in southeast China. By the end of the Yuan period, they had accrued substantial social and cultural capital, and were able to survive the fall of the Yuan. Moreover, one branch of the family remained in southeast China, where they served in the new Ming government.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, Middle Ages, Cultural anthropology, China, Elites, Ming dynasty, Survival, Uyghur, Yuan",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States

From an insignificant contributor to the global opium market, Iran became within a few decades an important exporter, turning to the market between 5-10% of the entire global production of opium. Opium-poppy cultivation and opium production formed part of a larger process of transition within the agricultural sector to cash-crop production. Under the growing pressure of increasing imports of European manufactured goods and the collapse of the local manual industries, the production of cash-crops, and particularly opium, was intended to balance Iran's trade deficit. The combination of timely political changes in China, technological improvements in steamboat navigation and a high-quality product, enabled the successful integration of Iranian opium within the global opium market. This success stands in contrast to the usual negative evaluation of Iran's social and economic reforms during the later 19 th -century. Parallel to the rise of opium production, opium consumption – particularly opium smoking – became very popular in Iran. The extent of this phenomenon caused concern among the country's political and cultural leadership, but the proponents of the anti-opium cause in Iran were never zealots, nor did they wield the sort of political power that matched the influence of anti-opium organizations in the US, Europe and China. Iran was early to join the diplomatic efforts to end the opium trade in the 20 th century, but it did so mostly in order to reject or postpone resolutions that would harm the Government's substantial opium revenues. In the end, the economic compensation that came with the larger share in the oil revenues, which Iran negotiated in 1954, and not internal political pressure by anti-opium groups, enabled Iran to forego its opium trade altogether.",2012,2012,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,History,History,"History, Middle Eastern history, Economic history, China, Consumption, India, Iran, Opium, Trade",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States

305449458,"Rhee, Hen Dong",The Taiping and the Tonghak rebellions as millenarian movements in global context: Historical and philosophical reflections,Contemporary,"Millenarian movements have been mainly studied from a monotheistic perspective. Traditional explanations for millenarian movements may not be applicable to Asian cases, since Asian millenarian views of salvation differ from non-Asian ones. This study re-examines the Taiping and the Tonghak movements in nineteenth century Asia using a much wider range of sources than have been used by scholars in the past. It seeks to understand the movements as an expression, in part, of deeply-rooted Asian spiritual ideas. It also offers historical and philosophical reflections on what studies of Asian millenarianism can contribute to the comparative study of millenarianism. Author defines history as self struggle. In Asian thought, there are two types of self: material and selfless. Material self means that one's material body is real. Selfless means that one's material body is not real. Material self struggle often manifests itself in violent millenarian movements, while selfless struggle ideally produces peaceful inner mind activities. In Western societies, the self struggles of millenarian movements were typically based on the idea of “spirit within material body.” In contrast, many Asian millenarian movements, inspired by the notion of “selfless” struggle, sought to avoid overt violence, although such movements frequently attracted elements associated with material self-struggle. Beliefs about salvation may be grounded in the wisdom of God, in intuition, or in reason. Scholars of millenarianism need to liberate themselves from explanatory models based on only one of these approaches. One needs instead to employ a comprehensive research strategy that draws on evidence from religion, culture, and the sciences. In reexamining the conceptual foundations of Asian millenarianism, the author explores ideas about “the end of the world” that are shared by major religions and natural scientists. He shows how Asian millenarian thought is related to I-jing and chi energy theory, linked to intuitive wisdom.

303883023,"Sung, Kwang-Yu",Religion and society in Ch'ing and Japanese colonial Taipei (1644-1945),Modern,"Since the May Fourth Incident in 1919, Chinese scholars have generally considered Chinese religion to be backward and harmful to modernization, and they have wanted to replace it with science and aesthetics. These views have deeply influenced modern education in both Taiwan and mainland China in this century. Nevertheless, native religion has flourished in Taiwan, especially as the island achieved economic prosperity. Many successful businessmen with modern scientific educations take part in religious affairs, many new and expensive temples have been constructed, and old, small temples were rebuilt. This phenomenon is quite contrary to the prediction of early Republican scholars. An intensive study of religion in Taiwan may help explain why. Because Taiwan was less influenced by the May Fourth Incident and its people practiced their traditional way in the Japanese colonial period, the century-old Hsia-hai City-god festival in Ta-tao-ch'eng, modern Taipei was selected as a case study. A general survey of Chinese immigration to Taiwan in the 17th and 18th century is given in Chapter 2. Social structure, guilds, and their religious activities are discussed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 considers how immigrants organized cultivation companies and developed the Taipei basin as a rice and tea export center and why businessmen promoted religious festivals. Chapters 5 and 6 consider how Chinese people in Taipei depended on traditional processions to march around the community in response to social crises, first a wave of epidemics in the early past century, and then economic recession in the 1920s. The processions with medical purposes required the cooperation of villages in northern Taiwan and caused many of them to identify themselves with the larger Taipei community. From the 1910s to 1930s, commercialized processions similarly helped isolated natural and economic zones merge into the large entity of Taiwan. The processions for medical purposes were only temporary. they occurred while the epidemics were spreading. Processions with commercial purposes, by contrast, were held regularly, usually one every year. The integration they promoted was therefore more effective and made Ta-tao-ch'eng the number one economic center in Taiwan. Economic and cultural change thus proceeded hand in hand. Sub-ethnic identities of Ch'uan-chou, Chang-chou, and Hakka immigrants were reconstructed into a new Taiwanese society.

305310936,"Skar, Lowell Dean",Golden Elixir alchemy: The formation of the southern lineage of Taoism and the transformation of medieval China,Medieval,"This dissertation uses a wide range of sources to show that alchemy was part of China's evolving culture between the fourth and fifteenth centuries. It views alchemy as self-cultivation traditions rooted in cults to immortals, rather than comparing it to modern chemistry and psychotherapy, or identifying it as an intrinsic part of Daoist religion. Alchemy emerged as private and nonofficial forms of self-cultivation, often structured by cults and supra-familial spiritual organizations. Literati learned alchemy to hasten their spiritual ascent into ranks of the divine, whether through making medicines, models of cosmic process, or integrating exercise and meditation. They taught alchemy to promote spiritual order in society, initiating peers into alchemical fellowships grounded in local religion. By embedding alchemical self-cultivation in the deepest sources of Chinese civilization and cosmic process, they also created new identities for themselves. The chapters examine the background and formation of Golden Elixir ( jindan ) alchemy in literati culture from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries. Ge Hong (283–343) synthesized three alchemical traditions to promote elixirs that could convey spiritual powers and transcendence, making Golden Elixir alchemy a permanent part of the literati imagination. Alchemy slowly shifted its focus from spiritual ascent through refining mineral and metallic elixirs toward refining energies within the body according to schematized processes of chemical change. A minor official named Zhang Boduan (d. 1082) received new Golden Elixir teachings centered on internal cultivation in 1069, and over the next three centuries, literati spun his teachings into a rich tradition, mainly in South China. The circle around Bai Yuchan (1194–1229?) and the next three generations was important here. The first Ming emperor excluded this new alchemy from his vision of official learning in 1371, while some of his cultural advisors recast it as the Southern Lineage of Taoism ( daojia nanzong ) in order to give it a prominent place in the new empire's nonofficial culture. Its teachings became part of the Ming Daoist canon, and became central to sectarian religious forms, helping to give personal spirituality and local traditions a grand view of the divine hierarchy and cosmos that was independent of the state.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, Science history, Asian literature, Religious history, Alchemy, China, Golden Elixir, Medieval, Taoism",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
304474910,"Chang, Che-chia",The therapeutic tug of war: The Imperial physician-patient relationship in the era of Empress Dowager Cixi (1874-1908),Contemporary,"This thesis constructs the medical history of the Qing Imperial family when Empress Dowager Cixi was the matriarch. Its underlying question is how the patient and the physician reacted to each other in the therapeutic process. The discussions concentrate on the differences of views between the physician and the patient. their communications. the factors influencing their decision-making. and the correlation between the physicians' social background and their behavior. In this regard this dissertation concludes that the physician-patient relationship rather than technical knowledge played the central role in the therapies. The relationship even affected how much the physician could crystallize his medical opinions. In the studied cases, the physicians' social background, bureaucratic or unofficial, significantly characterized the pattern of the imperial physician-patient interactions. When they first worked together in 1880, the divergence of the physicians' attributes caused tumults which gave Cixi a disastrous experience. However, she learned the lesson and applied it to her later decisions regarding medicare, which help to handle some political issues. By studying Cixi's family medical history as a long-run case, I am able to present that the therapeutic process was not only interactive but also dynamic. Other than the palace medical archives, I use physicians' private writings, witnesses' records as the primary sources, supplemented with the contemporary newspapers, jottings, medical manuals, and various historical works for explaining the technical and social circumstance. Through cross-reading these materials, I discovered that a portion of the medical archives were severely edited in an effort to distort the sequence of medical events. For those which were not, the imperial physicians often withheld information from their reports. I illustrate how a physician could construct his reports to be truthful but with subtext for the well-informed reader to interpret. As well the physicians' private writings had problems of reliability in different ways. These discoveries expose the imperfection of the trend in China to learn master physicians' experience by reading their published case histories. Finally I discuss the problems of the notion of experience, and suggest that by considering physician-patient relationship scholars can contribute to a richer Chinese medical history.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, Science history, China, Cixi, Empress Dowager, Qing Imperial family",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States
304512731,"Smith, Hilary A.",Foot qi: History of a Chinese medical disorder,Medieval,"This is a history of foot qi (jiăo qì), an ancient disorder that appears in Chinese documents from at least the sixth century to the present day. This study makes the historiographical argument that we must understand the social and cultural context in which physicians were working in order to understand ancient disease rightly. attention to symptoms and mastery of modern medical knowledge are insufficient. I adopt here the approach that recent historians have developed to analyze modern Western disease categories, discussing foot qi in every period as a combination of both biological and social processes. This has meant observing not only its symptoms in medical literature, but also the social processes that have created and re-created it over the centuries. Seen through this lens, foot qi makes several important contributions to our understanding of pre-modern Chinese medicine and society. Its early history, centered on the seventh and then the eleventh through twelfth centuries, suggests that relationships between classical physicians and laymen changed significantly during these periods, with classical physicians feeling their authority threatened by popular medical knowledge. Next, changing interpretations of the disorder in the thirteenth century shed light on the development of regional medical theories, as some physicians began to believe that foot qi came in northern and southern types while others cleaved to a more universal understanding of illness. In the same period, classical physicians began to scrutinize dietary causes of disease more carefully, writing about a new form of foot qi that resembled the gout in contemporaneous European sources. Finally, foot qi 's modern history, beginning in the late nineteenth century, shows how political and intellectual change first in Japan and then in China helped reduce a complex ancient disease entity to a simpler concept defined by etiology.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"History, Science history, Ethnic studies, China, Diet, Disease, Foot qi, History of medicine, Japan, Medical disorder",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States

Straddling the Chinese heartland, Tibetan plateau, and the Mongol steppe, the highland region was a convergence zone that facilitated a constant flow of people, goods, and knowledge. Competing visions over the highland, as both historical phenomena and research perspective, highlight the dynamic nature of the region and its function as a bridge for cross-cultural encounters and transregional geopolitical interactions. By investigating how and why different social groups understood the highland differently, this dissertation scrutinizes the operating mechanism of a borderland society and its role in macroregional geopolitics. Focusing on material exchanges, knowledge circulations, border-crossings, and contestations over territoriality through the lens of Ming emperors, highland regime lords, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Ming military deserters, and Mongol nomads, this dissertation highlights the formation of a borderland space as the outcome of constant compromise and negotiation. This dissertation argues that the conflict of ideas and agendas in the highland provided the driving force not only for the formation of its political-economic landscape, social structure, and human-environment relations, but also the transformation of the highland from a middle ground where multiple territorial perceptions co-existed into a demarcating frontier between Ming China and the Inner Asian world.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,History,History,"Inner Asian highland, Ming China, Mountain society, Sino-Tibetan borderland,",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States

Stone inscriptions associated with various lay socio-religious groups from the second century to the seventh century C.E. are the primary vehicles for the study of this subject. By reading through these primary sources, I argue that the widespread lay Buddhist societies have an indigenous Chinese root. In the second century C.E., the commoners were already actively involved in religious or sacrificial events held among their communities. When the teachings of Buddhism, Daoism, and other beliefs were disseminating in early medieval China, the need for making joint commissions and establishing religious societies among the local communities persisted. Although the teachings and the iconography of these beliefs vary, the practices and the format of these joint commissions were basically the same. Furthermore, these lay socio-religious societies and their local monasteries were closely connected and supported each other as patrons and religious teachers.

The research focuses on the provision of social resources, and specifically, how Chinese society procured and allocated care for persons with severe mental illness (SMI). The development and dissemination of such knowledge is important because of its relevance to social work practice and the field of social welfare. In the late nineteenth century, American medical missionaries established China's first insane asylum in the southern port city of Canton— the John G. Kerr Refuge for the Insane . This Western social institution was built during a time of intense anti-Western sentiment and deep suspicion over motives and practices—the Chinese had mixed feelings about things foreign. In addition, for well over 4000 years the Chinese preferred keeping “insane relatives” within the extended household system rather than segregating them into built institutions. The change in practice raises several questions of interest to social welfare: Why the welfare shift from family to market and why at Canton in 1898? How did contextual factors promote and/or inhibit the transfer of the Western insane asylum? And, what social welfare conditions were necessary for the missionaries to successfully transfer an institutional approach to SMI? Two theories are examined to explain the accommodation of insanity in China— social technology transfer and a shifting welfare mix . Each theory provides a robust explanation of why China shifted its social location of the insane. The research was based on a case study of the Kerr Refuge—along with intensive field research in Guangzhou, China—in order to examine the causal links making the shift possible. The research concludes that urbanization, population density, housing conditions, the rise of a municipal elite interested in philanthropy and social actors, sufficiently explains the accommodation of the Kerr Refuge at Canton.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pennsylvania,NA,NA,"Social work, Welfare, Social structure, Mental health, History, Canton, China, Insanity, Social technology, Welfare shift",43,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,40.0077,-75.1339,United States

The shifting pattern of those flows is shaped by the ways in which human beings exercise power over and with one another. And in turn, the flow of power is shaped by the movement of energy and information. This study of the Taipei Station District traces these complex relations: power of flows and flows of power. The core narrative is grounded in a series of political regimes which built and rebuilt the district and the networks connecting it to the island and the world beyond. The district and the network were repeatedly the site of tacit resistance and overt conflict between rulers and ruled. Groups struggled over the design and planning of flows. The dissertation describes the incidence and form of this sometimes tacit and sometimes overt conflict in and around the station district.

2694483235,"Yip, Yuk Lum Jennifer",Of Rice and Men: Nationalist Military Grain Procurement and Transport Policies in Wartime China (1937–1945),Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the Chinese Nationalist government’s military grain procurement and transportation policies during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). It examines both the bureaucratic agencies mandated to manage grain, and the mobilization programs which delivered provisions to more than 5 million soldiers. The acquisition of grain decisively shaped both Chinese and Japanese strategies for waging protracted war. This became starkly clear between late 1938 and early 1944, when grain acquisition replaced battlefield engagements as the crux of Nationalist, Communist and Japanese survival. Particularly after 1941, all three fighting forces were locked in a drawn-out competition for a dwindling pool of sustenance. Committed to self-sufficiency, all had to live off the same ravaged land. The war was therefore as much a struggle for food security as it was a contest of conscription or firepower. In response, the Nationalists resorted to the systemized extraction of labor beyond military conscription at the most localized levels of society. The civilians carrying out the various stages of grain provisioning were just as vital as combatants–for the armies relied on multiple interlinked networks of civilian effort for their daily sustenance. The militarization of food, the humblest of material concerns, drew whole communities into the fold of conflict. The central government’s food provisioning program put on display a remarkable capacity for organizing resources throughout Free China. Yet, it also revealed a readiness to thrust civilian lives and livelihoods on the line. Effective administration did not guarantee citizen welfare; in fact, the Nationalists’ victory hinged on imposed civilian sacrifice. The Chinese experience is vital to the historiography on food supply in World War II. Its defining contingencies–protracted foreign occupation, geographical expanse, and agrarian economy–resulted in direct, sustained civilian participation in military provisioning processes of remarkable depth and scale. The dissertation also presents logistics as the methodological bridge between social and military history.

In exploring their connectedness with both the authorities and the rural people, this dissertation highlights grassroots experiences and individual agency in Socialist China. Centering on the oft-dismissed social dimension of propaganda, this dissertation demonstrates that the effectiveness of Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda in the countryside depended not on ideological persuasion or a new political culture, but on constant and dynamic interactions among the Party, its grassroots agents, and the rural population.

Five instances of sociopolitically complex societies are recognized in Lingnan: northern Guangdong (Shixia Culture) and western Guangdong during Period I (3000-1400 B.C.). southern Guangxi and eastern Guangdong (Fubin Culture) during Period II (1400-600 B.C.). and much of Lingnan during period III (600-220 B.C.). The aims of the study are threefold: (1) to characterize more precisely than before the nature of interaction with northern regions. (2) to determine how the 'elements' of interaction played a role locally in the process of hierarchization. and (3) to detect how different types interaction may be associated with differences in different types of trajectories, paying special attention to the stability of social systems. Spatial, chronological and artifactual data is used to show that interaction with northern areas played a role in most instances of complex developments in Lingnan at this time, although existing local populations 'recruited' these elements of interaction rather than reacted passively to northern impact. In most instances, interaction is indicated by the presence of few northern artifacts (obtained through a 'down-the-line' exchange system) and local copies of such goods. By Period III, more directed relations link Lingnan with the Chu state to the north. It is suggested that in most instances, copies of northern goods are used in display and competition for power by would-be leaders. When northern stylistic innovations become unavailable to societies in Lingnan as a result of political/cultural change in central China, these societies are seen to experience a decrease in social complexity. It is suggested that continued and gradual development in the scale and hierarchical complexity of social systems is associated with a leadership in control of subsistence activities rather than one which relies on display and mystification for the support of the population. In the latter case, the system remains at the mercy of perturbations in the source of artifacts and ideas.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, China",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States
305253067,"Indrisano, Gregory G.","Subsistence, environmental fluctuation and social change: A case study in south central Inner Mongolia",Pre-modern,"According to the early Chinese textual accounts, the polities of the Central Plain beginning in the Zhou, colonized the territory north of the Wei River, through the Ordos Region under the Great Bend of the Yellow River and north to the borders of modern Mongolia. The historical model suggested that military expansion and cultural diffusion expanded the agricultural lifeway of the empire through population replacement, but the texts do not describe the local social and political environment into which these policies were imposed. Liangcheng County, in central Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, is an excellent location to study the integration of populations into the Central Plain political system (500 BCE--200 CE). Archaeological survey provides the diachronic perspective that is necessary to examine the process of integration and to facilitate an understanding of how the intrusive social systems affected the indigenous social and political environment. During the chaotic Warring States period, Central Plain bureaucrats co-opted the feudal manor system of the Western Zhou and created a system of compact villages that assisted administrative control and increased agricultural production. The data here suggest that it is the village system that is exported to Liangcheng. Although the traditional interpretation suggests population replacement, in Liangcheng a settlement system characterized by single family homesteads on land that is not productive for agriculture persists from the Neolithic to the Han Dynasty period. The combination of new farming villages introduced during the Warring States period and the persistence of dispersed homestead sites suggests a gradual process of acculturation to Central Plain social norms, not a wholesale replacement of population. Not until the Han Dynasty does a majority of the populace move into villages on the best agricultural lands. The stability of the settlement pattern from the Neolithic into the Warring States period in similar locations that are not particularly advantageous for agriculture suggests that indigenous subsistence systems changed little until the Han Dynasty, implying that in Liangcheng, subsistence responded not to environmental fluctuation, but to social and political change.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, China, Environmental fluctuation, Han dynasty, Inner Mongolia, Settlement patterns, Social change, Subsistence",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States
304616401,"Li, Jian-jing",Mapping artifacts on the frontier of ancient China: An approach to study of the Yan mountainous area in the eastern Zhou period (8th –3rd centuries BC),Ancient,"Study of the late Zhou period in China has concentrated on analysis of the agrarian-based states. Interaction between those who constituted the Chinese dynastic states and pastoral peoples on the periphery of them were often described in hostile or colonial terms. With only the official histories as guides, an explanation that drew strict boundaries between them prevailed until the late 20 th century. With increased archaeological information documenting activity outside of dynastic centers, the former interpretation can be tested. An alternative scenario at the frontier is proposed here. Study of artifacts, their disposition and cultural use have provided the basic tool for identifying distinctive life ways and affiliations. Both Chinese and frontier burial materials and practices have been researched and interpreted with knowledge of and comparison to other “border” societies and theory about frontiers and their function in relation to a central political unit. Focus is on the Yan Mountain region and its relation to the Zhou vassal state of Yan in northeast China. This study below shows that both the “Shanrong” group of the Yan Mountain region and the Yan State had their own distinctive social order, cultural traditions and economic bases. Those are marked in the burial assemblages, tomb structures and architectural remains, suggesting that “Shanrong” was a pastoral and warrior society and was clearly different from the agrarian society of the Yan State. On the one hand, these differences contributed to the formation of an ethnic and cultural boundary. but on the other hand, these different modes of subsistence encouraged them to complement each other functionally, thus making the “Shanrong” part of a larger social complex. This case study demonstrates that the boundary between the “Shanrong” and the Yan State was fluid and was based on need. Interactions in trade, war and colonization occurring in the frontier zone exhibit evidence of the change through time. Technical and ecological factors stimulated a transformation of the structure of interchange on the pastoral/agricultural frontier. In addition, the elite groups from the Yan State and the “Shanrong” both played significant roles during the process, indicating that political authority still deeply influenced their interactions. Finally, inter-group contacts infused energy into the area and led these two groups to incorporate into a unified, multicultural Chinese kingdom.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Ancient, Artifacts, China, Eighth century B.C., Frontier, Mapping, Third century B.C., Yan mountainous area, Zhou period",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States
304372586,"Ge, Yan",The coexistence of artistic styles and the pattern of interaction: Sanxingdui during the second millennium BC,Ancient,"The discovery of Sanxingdui unexpectedly revealed an urban center in the Chengdu Basin. Equally unexpected, indigenous and Shang style artifacts coexisted at the site, and with the Shang works serving local purposes. From the perspective of interaction, this study is an attempt to understand how and why this society was able to maintain its artistic identity while engaging in interaction with the more complex and powerful Shang. The Chengdu Basin, known for its self-sufficient environment, was in a landlocked setting. During the third millennium BC, if not earlier, communities there became stratified and developed distinctive symbol systems. It was not until the next millennium that Sanxingdui connected with the middle-Yangzi region. Later the Sanxingdui complex gained regional dominance and was in extensive interaction within the basin and beyond. The mid-Yangzi areas, where communities grew rapidly after stimulation by the Shang, may have served as providers of Shang casting technology and artifact types to the Chengdu Basin area. Nevertheless, Sanxingdui was neither a Shang colony nor its direct exchange partner. Inter-regional contact served as a resource that strengthened Sanxingdui's position in a competitive regional network, which may have supplied subsistence goods and other materials. Studies of the Pacific Northwest, Burma and Mesoamerica, where elite arts in the less complex groups were assimilated by more complex partners, suggest that the changes of those elite arts are a parameter of interaction. Variables significant to the changes are: (i) base and level of social development of participating communities, or base of interaction. (ii) demand generated by the development, or motivation of interaction. (iii) resources available, or materials in exchange. and (iv) form of interaction, such as migration, warfare or trade. By comparison, Sanxingdui was among highly stratified local communities with an entrenched symbolism. was in a self-sufficient environment. was in indirect contact with Shang. and was, therefore, allowed to develop continuously the indigenous identity while making use of outside art for its own sake.

It traces the shifting meanings attributed to embroideries from their use in memorial services during the Kamakura period (1185-1333) to objects metonymic of devout female patrons during the Muromachi period (1333-1573). In past scholarship, Buddhist hair embroideries were evaluated as mere copies of painted masterpieces and thus remain little studied. This study, however, will emphasize materiality over iconography and practice over doctrine to show that Buddhist embroideries uniquely supported the soteriological needs and ritual practices of Japanese women. Each chapter demonstrates that embroidered Buddhist icons enabled women to subvert religious doctrine concerning the impurities of their sex, form a bond with the Buddha, and establish female presence in an otherwise male-dominated space. Chapter Two traces the cross-cultural movement and adaptation of Kannon (Sk. Avalokiteśvara, C. Guanyin) embroideries from China to Japan and considers how the ritual use of these embroideries in Japan differed from those on the continent. Chapter Three examines the development of Japanese Buddhist images embroidered with hair in the late twelfth century to show how this medium was thought to accrue worldly and soteriological merit for women. Chapter Four focuses on the ritual significance of hair embroideries attributed to Chūjōhime (753?-781?) a legendary aristocratic woman credited with attaining enlightenment after commissioning the famous Taima mandara tapestry. These chapters employ methods of social history, material culture studies, and the history of the body to examine Buddhist hair embroideries not simply for their artistic value (iconography and visuality), but also their cultic value within ritual contexts. Such theories provide a framework for understanding why women were encouraged to express religious devotion through practices that emphasized the sacrifice and denial of their bodies. This dissertation ultimately challenges the assumption that female devotees were marginalized figures in Buddhist communities and contributes an art historical approach to growing scholarship in the fields of history and religious studies on the agency of premodern Japanese women.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,Dietrich School Arts and Sciences,Arts and Sciences,"Buddhist art, Chujohime, Gender and religion, Materiality, Patronage, Textiles,",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States

Using Manchukuo textbooks, education journals, and post-war memoirs, it examines the background of the policy-makers, the nature of the ideology they constructed, and the role language played in dissemination of the ideology. The study traces the efforts by the Japanese officials to create a new “Manchurian” national consciousness which they hoped would replace Chinese nationalistic identity among the majority Han Chinese. Originally they tried to shape this identity by employing familiar Chinese models which they expected would mask Japanese control. They used Confucian terminology and appeals to historical precedents to try to legitimize the creation of an independent northeastern state. In time, however, the weight of Japanese demands for empire-wide ideological orthodoxy led the Manchukuo leaders to abandon the Chinese models, and instead portray the state as client, dependent on the Japanese Emperor and in need of an injection of Japan's superior culture. Leading Japanese officials began to support forcing the Chinese to follow Japanese linguistic and ceremonial forms in hopes that it would cause them to appreciate and even willingly support the Japanese effort towards creating a unified Greater East Asia. In other words, their goals changed from securing an acquiescent population to creating willing allies, an effort in which they were ultimately unsuccessful. While the Manchukuo education bureaucracy supported the shift towards an emphasis on the Japanese language, as late as 1943 they resisted attempts at filling the curriculum with Japanese militaristic and imperial material, defying the current trend in Japan and Korea. This resistance was lead by a group of Japanese educators who were participants in the liberal “New Education movement” of the 1920s, who found in Manchukuo an opportunity to implement school reforms which had become impossible in the increasingly conservative atmosphere in Japan. Their success at keeping militaristic elements at bay demonstrates the Japanese empire was less monolithic than usually thought.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,NA,NA,"History, China, Identity, Japanese, Manchukuo, Manchurian",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States

As heralds of a new medium with unprecedented capacity for shaping people's perceptions, beliefs, and viewpoints, American films were received and interpreted by Chinese audiences in a transnational context. My research is mostly based on rarely or never used primary sources both in the United States and China, mainly in archives including the U.S. official documents of the Department of State located at the National Archives, the special collection of the United Artists at the Wisconsin State Historical Society Library, indexed New York Times, and D.W. Griffith's unpublished documents such as D.W. Griffith Papers 1897-1954, 1927 Yearbook of Chinese Cinema, 1920s fan magazines such as The Movie Guide, The China Film Pictorial, The Stage and Screen, The Photoplay World, Photoplay Pictorial, The Movie Magazine, and Cineograph, a collection of film plot sheets, and local popular magazines such as The Good Companion. Through my dissertation, I have found that the promotion and consumption of American films in 1920s Shanghai did not result in a homogeneous American culture as the Chinese re-deployed, re-invented, and appropriated American films for local political, cultural, and social discourses. During that turbulent decade, Hollywood films played into the Chinese political discourse of nationalism and modernity. The modernity discourse was prominent in the Chinese filmic texts and extra-textual filmic spheres. Hollywood's impact on China can be examined by the reaction of the Chinese film industry toward American films, the changing lifestyle of Chinese locals, and their perception of American people and values.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,NA,NA,"History, Mass communications, Film studies, American silent films, Chaplin, Charlie, China, Fan magazines, Fan magazines in 1920s Shanghai, Film piracy, Film piracy in 1920s China, Film reception, Hollywood, Hollywood overseas, Shanghai, Silent films",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States

I examine four stories and ballads either composed or revised during this time, looking broadly at the role of the State in the creative process. I consider the role of high-ranking officials whose personal comments to artists shaped their creative processes, and the role of societal political pressure placed on artists through political movements and shifting trends in the dramatic arts. I study the artists? responses to these political forces as expressed in their newly composed and revised works. I examine decisions made during the creation of story and ballad texts, and analyze bold innovations taken by three artists during the composition of ballad music. I suggest that the musical innovations be viewed both as responses to the coercive political atmosphere of the 1950s and 1960s and as significant expressions of artistic freedom within this politicized atmosphere. This dissertation begins with an overview of the main research questions, theoretical framework, research methodology, and literature. This is followed in Chapter 2 by an introduction to the art form, and an exploration of the 1950s-1960s period in Chinese history in Chapter 3.

304615860,"Liu, Shi-yung",Medical reform in colonial Taiwan,Contemporary,"This thesis focuses on medical reform and public health changes in colonial Taiwan (1895–1945). One goal of this study is to reveal the development of medical reform in colonial Taiwan. The second goal is to understand Taiwan's experience in the international diffusion of medical knowledge. Finally, the third goal is to analyze the possible factors that shaped medical reform and to reassess Japanese colonialism. In the field of medicine, this study focused on the impact of modern Japanese medicine on medical practice in Taiwan. During the colonial era (1895–1945), two related processes—the creation of medical resources and the establishment of new medical system—with three components (preventive medicine, laboratory, and new medical institutions) formed the medical reform in Taiwan. It is also useful to think of medical reform in colonial Taiwan as a process that took place in various stages. In the early stage between the 1910s and 1920s, medical and hygiene measures were directed at infectious and communicable diseases. In the 1930s, Taiwan entered its second stage of medical reform. The reform in this period showed a health transition that encompassed a broader range of the life cycle, a multiplicity of diseases with various causes, and less effective social and technological interventions. Here the goal was incrementally to add health and increase life expectancy to each age group. From a political perspective, colonialism was the most important political issue. The colonial government believed in the supremacy of a colonial government able to effectively implement reformatory measures, ruthlessly if necessary. The implementation occurred at great expense of political liberty and human lives before the 1920s. However, after the late 1920s, the instruments of medical reform depended more on the development of clinical medicine than on social mobilization and governmental intervention. Finally, an examination of medical reform in colonial Taiwan points to the importance of understanding what kind of reform was taking place and how to identify changes in this reform. This study has underscored the importance of many developmental factors beyond the increase of medical facilities that profoundly influenced the health of the colonial population.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,NA,NA,"History, Pharmaceuticals, History, China, Colonial, Medical reform, Public health, Taiwan",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States
304446065,"Dott, Brian Russell",Ascending Mount Tai: Social and cultural interactions in eighteenth century China,Modern,"Mount Tai, a center for popular religion and imperial ritual, has long been sacred to Daoism, Confucianism and Buddhism. Linked to China's omnipresent driving force, filial piety, Mount Tai has been a magnet for the socio-religious energies of Chinese from all walks of life, including women, men, literati, villagers, religious leaders, lay believers, local officials and emperors. By the eighteenth century throngs of worshipers and visitors orchestrated spatial and ritual competitions upon, within and against the sacred geography of Mount Tai. I study how each group appropriated, interpreted or re-created site or myth, and the contentions and unities produced, to understand how Qing society (1644-1911)operated. I use sources and methods from history, religious studies, anthropology, art history, folklore studies and geography, and include some anthropological fieldwork. The Qing dynasty, particularly the long eighteenth century (1680-1820), affords me the broadest range of pilgrims and extensive pilgrimage records. Worship of the Goddess of Mount Tai (the most popular deity at Mount Tai in the late imperial period) was particularly vigorous in the eighteenth century, when emperors personally visited Mount Tai. My study is the first to trace the Qing social landscape of Mount Tai, examining mentalities of women and illiterate pilgrims, as well as literati, and to combine fiction, poetry, travelogues and official records along with material culture and anthropological study. Despite the many differences, pilgrims had common practices. Filial piety, nature worship, reverence for writing and the importance of rituals were among the elements that held eighteenth century Chinese society together. Beyond Chinese Studies, my multi-disciplinary focus on a site attracting a cross-section of society, to analyze how a culture operated, is transferable to other regions and periods. In Part One, I place Mount Tai in historical and cultural context. In addition to sites, legends and history, I explore various deities' roles. In Part Two, I focus on eighteenth-century pilgrims, in sections on women, men, and the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors. In Part Three, I analyze competitions between groups and institutions, providing general conclusions and analysis of twentieth century governmental attempts to re-appropriate this sacred site.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,NA,NA,"History, Religious history, Cultural anthropology, China, Cultural interactions, Eighteenth century, Social interactions",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States
305271717,"Phillips, Tina",Building the nation through women's health: Modern midwifery in early twentieth-century China,Contemporary,"China's nation-building agenda in the early twentieth century embraced the causes of women's rights and medical modernization. Modernizers considered the poor health of the Chinese population to be a major impediment to progress. Specifically, modern midwifery would improve the health of the nation at its most fundamental level, both by lowering the high infant mortality rate and by securing the well-being of future generations. Amid growing interest in maternal and child health, women entered the Western medical profession as midwives, nurses, and obstetrician/gynecologists. Local and national governments in China supported midwife training and research for the health of future generations. China's central government established a National Midwifery Board in 1929 to create and oversee training programs and enact laws to regulate modern midwives and physicians. Medical professionals and associations had enough political clout to transform public health policy. They successfully lobbied for legislation and actively advocated adopting aspects of Western medicine for women. Midwives engendered better and stronger generations by using new methods and equipment. Furthermore, midwife training allowed Chinese women to participate in modernization by joining the labor force, thus challenging traditional Chinese notions of female passivity and seclusion. At the same time, however, these modern midwives displaced the traditional old-style birth grannies who had served as social and ritual mediators within the family and community. This research examines midwifery and childbirth technologies introduced into China in the early twentieth century in relation to nation building, modernization, and changing gender ideologies. By using biographical data, legislation, and articles in the popular press, among other sources, I explore the changing notions of gender propriety that prompted Chinese women to utilize Western-trained midwives, read literature dealing with such intimate matters as childbirth and prenatal training, give birth in hospitals or maternity clinics, and enter the medical profession as midwives.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, History, China, Midwifery, Nation, Professionalization, Twentieth century, Women's health",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States
304255970,"Guy, Nancy Ann",Peking opera and politics in post-1949 Taiwan,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the goals, mechanisms, and consequences of state control of performing arts, taking Peking opera in Taiwan as the subject. Ever since its transplantation from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan in the late 1940s, Peking opera has been under almost total support and control from the exiled government of the Republic of China (ROC). Until 1987, the ROC government maintained a policy of no contact towards the Communist-controlled mainland. As a result, Taiwan's Peking opera tradition remained sheltered from many changes undergone by the tradition on the mainland. Policy changes made during the late 1980s dramatically altered Taipei/Beijing relations, with the most profound change being the ROC government's lifting of its forty-year ban on travel to the mainland. In keeping with other political changes, the Peking opera censorship policy was revised in 1988 to allow for performance of much of the formerly contraband post-1949 mainland repertoire. This dissertation examines the ways in which government policy has shaped the growth of Peking opera in Taiwan. Censorship decrees and their close association with broader political policies are examined. I assert that the decrees, which were instrumental in guiding the tradition's development, were essentially statements of the Nationalists' official position towards the mainland. The government's administration and control of Peking opera were inseparably linked to the overall political environment. The tradition's development can, therefore, be seen largely as a by-product of the political process. The dissertation analyzes the reaction of Taiwan's Peking opera world to the legalization of contact with the mainland, especially the performers' enthusiastic reception of the contemporary mainland repertoire. Finally, a discussion of the difficulties encountered by Taiwan singers and musicians in learning new operas illustrates some of the musical differences that evolved between the two traditions. The political issues and concerns that fundamentally affected the formation of Nationalist Peking opera policy (and hence, the tradition's artistic and creative development) also penetrated and influenced nearly every aspect of life in Taiwan. This study offers a unique perspective from which to view Nationalist Taiwan, and it shows that government control of politically symbolic institutions, such as Peking opera, can clearly reflect the policies and ideology basic to a regime's strategies for governing.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,NA,NA,"Music, Theater, History, Political science, China, nationalism",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States
2200000000,"Eirkson, Christopher Edward","Ideas of Empire in Early Ming China: The Legacy of the Mongol Empire in Chinese Imperial Visions, 1368–1500",Modern,"In the mid-fourteenth century the branch of the Mongol empire in China, the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368), collapsed. In its wake arose a new political order, the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the last imperial state in China founded by Chinese. The cultural and ethnic differences between the rulers and courts of these two dynasties suggests stark differences between them, and the rhetoric of early Ming rulers, when read at face value, indicates that the Ming represented the resurgence of native sovereignty and the rejection of Mongol Yuan administrative practices, military endeavors, and expansive models of imperial rule. Over the last two decades, innovative research has questioned these assumptions, but there remain unappreciated connections between the Yuan and Ming that reveal the complex ways in which Ming rulers adapted Yuan state-building practices and understood the Ming dynasty’s relationship with its Mongol past. Building on world historical methodology and recent work in the field of Yuan-Ming studies, this dissertation argues that early Ming rulers and statesmen viewed their empire as the successor of the Yuan and readily incorporated Mongol-generated imperial language, practices, and state-building methods into the new Ming polity. Early Ming emperors consciously redeployed steppe state-building traditions. They sought to re-establish Yuan patterns of hegemony over continental East Asia, and in pursuit of these goals, designed strategic policies and commissioned representations that mirrored Yuan imperial visions. When discussing Mongol subjects of the Ming and relations with Mongol groups in the steppe, Ming court language carefully distinguished between cultural and political identities. It was not until the 1440s that Ming rulers, facing military disaster in conflict with Mongols, curtailed their broad ideas of empire, a strategic decision that culminated in the construction of what we know today as the Great Wall. In a larger Eurasian context, this study places the Ming dynasty closer to other contemporary post-Mongol empires, including Muscovite Russia and the Ottomans. In China, as elsewhere in Eurasia, the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries witnessed the adaptation and modification of Mongol imperial ideas rather than the rejection of the Mongol past.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,University of Pittsburgh,History,History,"Social sciences, China, Early-modern, Empire, Eurasia, Ming Dynasty, Mongol,",13,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,40.4397,-79.9763,United States
304580187,"Holder, Jennifer Yvonne",Hong Kong after the handover: An interpretive study of culture and politics among selected business professionals,Contemporary,"After one hundred and fifty-six years as a British colony, on July 1, 1997, Hong Kong was handed over to the People's Republic of China. This research explores culture and politics in Hong Kong as understood from the perspective of selected business-people during the first year after the handover. Changes in personal, civic and cultural identity are also examined together with an investigation as to whether such changes resulted from the handover. The views of Hong Kong immigrants living outside of Hong Kong, primarily in San Francisco, are presented as a commentary on the changes in Hong Kong's culture as seen from the outside by those with a similar cultural background. This participatory research involved formal conversations with a total of 32 participants in Hong Kong and San Francisco and informal conversations with several other participants. In addition to the conversations with the participants, data were gathered from a review of literature, films, and personal observations of public and private events. The research findings are analyzed from a critical hermeneutic perspective, applying the theories of Arendt, Geertz, Ricoeur and others. During the first year post-handover, the Hong Kong participants were apt to report that life was much the same as before—no change. There were, however, subtle cultural I changes observed and experienced, such as increased awareness of a unity within the ethnic-Chinese community and a growing closeness to the rest of Asia and particularly mainland china. The growing pride in Chinese identity is a noteworthy change directly related to the handover. The event that most marked the first year post-handover and which was not attributed to the handover was the turmoil in the economic market. With respect to political awareness in Hong Kong, despite evidence of such, the participants avow, however, that Hong Kong people's interest in politics is minimal and that anxiety over their country's political, future is minor. Continued prosperity for Hong Kong is the overwhelming hope for Hong Kong's future. This research found the economy is the most meaningful aspect of Hong Kong's culture, implying therefore that Hong Kong's challenges lie in the business arena.",1999,1999,Ed.D.,United States,University of San Francisco,NA,NA,"Social structure, Cultural anthropology, History, Business professionals, China, Cultural identity, Hong Kong, Politics",1,San Francisco,California,37.7558,-122.4449,United States
304246748,"Li, Xin Yu",An inquiry into an infraconnection of the Greater Chinese Economic Cooperation System,Contemporary,"The Greater Chinese Economic Cooperation System (GCECS) refers to the regional development entity primarily among the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan with a broad support from all the overseas Chinese. During the 1990s, the fast economic growth of the GCECS is already a phenomenon with major significance in East Asia. However, the GCECS is so atypical that the theories of international relations (IR) and international political economy (IPE) cannot be properly applied to the analysis of its origins, substance, dynamics and prospects. This is mainly because that most of IR and IPE theories are nation-state-oriented. They can hardly come to a consistent conclusion when political obstacles and economic development, nation-states and non-nation-states, and integration and disintegration co-exist within one system. The GCECS is such a system. Hence, the challenges by the GCECS reveal some weaknesses of IR and IPE theories in the study of non-nation state systems with multi-dimensional developments. In fact, system has not been tangibly defined in the IR and IPE theories. By analyzing an essential phenomenon, the dimorphism of an actor's behavior, this dissertation introduces an approach with a new concept of infraconnection, which integrates essential linkages and systemic supports for actors in a system. Hence, an economic and social system is no longer simply a sum of its actors, but a tangible and measurable network which plays an important role in many fields of IR and IPE. The case of GCECS has demonstrated that infraconnection is one of the most important dynamics to drive and shape the primary economic take-off and multi-integration in the GCECS. Thus, to improve infraconnection becomes another decisive factor for the regional development. Such a practicable approach could be described as STRUCTURAL IDEALISM, which has profound implications for the improvement of international relations.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of South Carolina,NA,NA,"History, Economics, Political science, China, regional development",1,Columbia,South Carolina,34.0378,-80.9036,United States

Drawing upon a wide variety of literary, cultural, and film theories, the author investigates various genres and types of “Shanghai narratives” that have been largely neglected or rarely researched: fiction, film, architecture, advertising, and fashion. The author further contends that, with the advent and flourishing of various models of interpretation that tried to “make sense” of the metropolis, Shanghai quickly transformed from a “natural landscape” to a deeply-layered “cultural landscape.” The investigation of the competing discourses of the constructive and destructive potential of the metropolis, therefore, is more of an attempt to explore how the urban landscape of Shanghai was culturally imagined in ideological and gender terms than of an endeavor to document an already vanished past. In emphasizing the hybrid nature of the urban experience of Shanghai, the author aims first to challenge the dominant discourse which celebrates the rural as the fundamental expression of the “indigenous” and “authentic” China and which reduces Shanghai as a mere symbol of national humiliation and moral degradation. The author's second aim is to establish Shanghai and its culture as an alternative model that not only challenges the unitary discourse of Chinese revolutionary nationalism, but also questions the conception that the metropolis was nothing but a Western import. The third aim of this work is to renounce totalizing explanatory models in dealing with Shanghai's semi-colonial culture and to offer an alternative reading of the city by introducing the concepts of negotiation, resistance, dynamism, location, fluidity, and spatiality. Cities do not speak for themselves. It is humans who speak of cities and give them narrative power.

304620412,"Zhuang, Guo-ou",Imagining China: “Niehai Hua” as a national narrative,Modern,"Niehai Hua is an important Chinese novel written in the beginning of the twentieth century. This dissertation discusses the novel as a national narrative that testifies to the emergence of a modern form of national consciousness of the Chinese, using critical perspectives informed by postcolonial literary theory. Breaking away from a previous critical paradigm that has narrowly focused on the novel's exposition of the corruption of Chinese society in the late imperial era, this study focuses on the novel's representation of the transformation of China from a waning empire into a modern nation state. This study situates the novel in the global cultural context of the late nineteenth century and argues that the novel offers a representation of the identity crisis of the Chinese in the modern world, in essence that it embodies the Chinese attempt to re-map a changing China. Chinese imagination of western nations in the novel is a crucial part of the construction of a new national identity. The literary representation of this reveals layers of consciousness that are overlooked by other discourses of the time. For example, the alleged love affair between the heroine of the novel Caiyun and the allied commander Alfred Von Waldersee, is interpreted as a metaphor for the complex relationship between China and the Western powers, going beyond the simple dualism of victim versus oppressor. The study also discusses the xenophobia of the Chinese represented in the novel in episodes such as the map incident. The portrayal of the daily life of Chinese scholar-officials, which has been deemed insignificant by many critics, is seen as a significant effort to hold on to a familiar cultural identity. The study also discusses how the author of Niehai Hua incorporated western narrative elements, but meanwhile preserved indigenous narrative elements in an attempt to reconcile Chinese and Western literary traditions. Criticism of the novel's literary style reflects a hegemonic dominance of western aesthetic discourses, while in fact the novel may serve as a model for Chinese writers to reconstruct a native narrative tradition.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Southern California,NA,NA,"Comparative literature, Asian literature, History, China, National narrative, Niehai Hua, Novel, Zeng Pu",16,Los Angeles,California,34.1141,-118.4068,United States
305388269,"Gaetano, Arianne M.",Off the farm: Rural Chinese women's experiences of labor mobility and modernity in post -Mao China (1984–2002),Contemporary,"This dissertation is an ethnographic exploration of the lives and experiences of rural Chinese women who have migrated to the city of Beijing and found work in its informal service sector as domestic servants and chambermaids. Their experiences of labor migration provide a window on the interconnection of gender, place, and identity as well as power and agency in contemporary China. In their imaginaries, the journey to the city is seen as a passage into modernity, and gaining urban experience is symbolic of becoming modern. Through labor migration, rural women engage with new ideas about modernity and experience the ambiguities and ambivalence of the changes, no more so than that of their identity itself, that are set in motion by their pursuit of dreams. Ironically, the reality of migrant life in the city rarely fulfills such promise, because neither the state nor the market recognizes peasants and rural migrants as equals to urban citizens and workers. Denied the recognition by urban society as equally modern, exploited by state and market, most rural migrant women suffer broken dreams and shattered spirits. Especially as they begin to grapple with the ineluctable matters of marriage and return, young rural migrant women at best are ambivalent about their “experience of modernity.” Yet at the same time, they are empowered by their experiences, especially the exposure to new ideas and the acquisition of new skills and their changing sense of self as relatively modern compared to their nonmigrant peers. Most significantly, through their experiences, they challenge dominant ideologies of gender and place that marginalize them in rural households, urban society, and the labor market, albeit in limited and largely individual ways. Finally, for some rural migrant women, the unjust dissonance between imagination and reality that they experience first-hand becomes knowledge that empowers them to engage in more radical political critique and protest, including collective action. Indeed, rural migrant women display ingenuity and perseverance as they strive to imbue their migration experiences with meaning and dignity, and despite the unequal economic and social conditions of late socialist modernity, to “make themselves modern.”",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of Southern California,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, Womens studies, History, China, Labor mobility, Migration, Modernity, Post-Mao, Rural women",16,Los Angeles,California,34.1141,-118.4068,United States

The dissertation analyzes interconnected intellectual, spiritual, moral, and ritualistic themes reflected in Kouduo richao and other late Ming Christian dialogues, tracing authoritative thoughts in medieval Europe and imperial China and revealing various ways they were reinterpreted in a dialogic context. Aleni's instructions on practical learning were highly selective out of medieval Aristotelian-Thomist traditions, and subtly adaptive to classical Confucian thought, while Fujian converts responded with their reinterpretations (or misinterpretations) of classical sources and Jesuit sciences to shape a new Christian-Confucian identity. As for the spiritual and moral learning, Aleni and Fujian converts likewise involved in dynamic negotiations between Catholic doctrines and Confucian teaching by frequently shifting among different voices. Their dialogues revealed a tendency to create mutually acceptable ideas and to actualize them through filial piety to God the Great Father-Mother and parents, good works, and an interiorized contemplative life merging Ignatian spirituality and Confucian sincerity. In addition, many episodic, daily instructions of the Jesuit masters in Fujian were accompanied by visual representations of a hybrid Christian-Confucian identity. Objects, images, and rituals by means of reproduction and reinterpretation found their way to show up in Fujian socio-religious landscape, despite the growing opposition of anti-Christians. With interactive exchanges structured by a self-other relation, Christian and Chinese representations coexisted to shape a harmonious reality, visible and practicable. Based on the literary and cultural inquiry of later Ming Christian dialogism, this dissertation argues that Kouduo richao should be taken as a representative record of Aleni's Fujian mission with his consistent employment of both the intellectual and the religious. It exemplifies a macroscopic but substantial study of the Sino-Western encounter under the new theory dialogic hybridization, which leads to an integration of previous approaches, and through the underpinning trajectory from dialogue to the dialogic, helps a better understanding of China's past intercultural experience.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Southern California,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, Religious history, Aleni, Giulio, China, Christianity, Dialogic hybridization, Kouduo richao, Ming dynasty",16,Los Angeles,California,34.1141,-118.4068,United States
305318917,"Leibold, James Patrick",Constructing the Zhonghua minzu: The frontier and national questions in early 20th century China,Contemporary,"This study examines the attempts by China's Han ethnic majority to politically and culturally incorporate the ethnically heterogeneous polities of the former Qing empire (1644–1911) into a new national imaginary during the Republican Era (1911–1949), or what Sun Yat-sen first called a single, pure Zhonghua minzu (Chinese nation/race). In their attempts to fashion this new sense of corporate identity, Han political elites used a series of political and cultural strategies aimed at reifying the fluid political relations between the ethnically diverse citizens of the new Chinese Republic. The state's goal was not only the allegiance of the Tibetan, Mongolian and other frontier minorities towards the political center, but the construction of a myth of national belonging rooted in the perception of a common history, soil and blood. My treatment of Chinese nation-building attempts to demonstrate how, in many ways, the frontier and its ethnic minorities were central rather than peripheral to the process of “revolution” in modern China. Despite their relatively small numbers, the frontier minorities inhabited roughly sixty-percent of the Republic's national territory, most of which was located along the remote yet resource-rich borderlands crucial to the state's economic modernization yet also coveted by the imperialist powers. In the days following the collapse of the Qing empire in 1911, Mongolia, Tibet, Manchuria and other frontier regions broke with the Han political and cultural center. Faced with the possibility of losing much of their national territory and wealth to the foreign imperialists, Han elites stressed the urgent need for both the rhetorical and physical absorption of the frontier minorities into a thoroughly unified and ethnically pure Chinese Republic. By uncovering the complex process of nation-building in early 20th century China, my study attempts to shed new light on the Chinese state's attempts to homogenize (if not erase) ethnic and cultural diversity from its political and historical landscape. In short, the national and frontier questions in Republican China was fundamentally about the construction of a united, monoethnic and modern Zhonghua minzu —an “imagined community” capable of naturalizing the heterogeneous polities of the Qing empire into a single homogenous Chinese nation.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of Southern California,NA,NA,"History, Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, China, Frontier, National questions, Twentieth century, Zhonghua minzu",16,Los Angeles,California,34.1141,-118.4068,United States
250961621,"Liu, Xun",In search of immortality: Daoist inner alchemy in early twentieth-century China,Contemporary,"Amidst the early 20th century advance of nationalism, science, gender revolution and modern print media, how did China's ancient Daoism fare? I argue that this religious tradition did not decline, as some have claimed, but evolved and flourished. To show its transformation, I examine the life and work of Chen Yingning (1880–1969) and his Shanghai-based followers from 1920s to early 1940s. Led by Chen, the movement to promote “Immortals' Learning” (xian xue) proved pivotal in shaping the modern contours of ancient Daoist practice. It redefined Daoism as centered on inner alchemy (neidan), the Daoist meditative techniques evolved during the Tang-Song period. Consistent with their nationalist vision, Chen claimed Daoism as the source of the Chinese cultural essence by locating its origin in the Yellow Emperor legend. Further, Chen and others rejected the Buddhist Mind-centered body construction in favor of a robustly physical alchemic body shaped by two factors. First, their education and careers in modern medicine, business and science conditioned their spiritual outlook, leading them to appropriate concepts of physics, biology and psychology to reinterpret the traditional Daoist cosmology and practices. Second, because physical health became linked to national renewal in early twentieth century, a physically constructed alchemic body consecrated the flesh body as a legitimate venue for pursuing national salvation through personal self-cultivation practice. Also responsive to the emerging gender revolution, Chen and his associates valorized the gender-neutral energies of the Spirit (shen) and qi as the core of the alchemic body while downplaying the male-centered vitality of Essence (jing) which had dominated the traditional neidan discourse since the Song dynasty. Finally, publications on neidan by the Yi Hua Tang publishing house created an imagined community where fellowship rather than discipleship among practitioners became widespread. and access to Daoist knowledge and adepts was also rendered public and equal to both sexes through journals, lectures and published correspondence. This culminated in an unprecedented revival of Daoist learning and practice whose influence endures in today's qigong and other self-cultivation pursuits in China.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,University of Southern California,NA,NA,"History, Religious history, Chen Yingning, China, Daoist, Immortality, Inner alchemy, Twentieth century",16,Los Angeles,California,34.1141,-118.4068,United States
304456407,"Orliski, Constance Ilene","Reimagining the domestic sphere: Bourgeois nationalism and gender in Shanghai, 1904-1918",Contemporary,"This study uses the early twentieth century female periodical press to examine the subject of Chinese domesticity and the new woman in Shanghai. Earlier scholarship claimed that the new journalism offered a means of rallying women for revolutionary purposes in the political arena, or that the female press was merely a didactic device of male reformers seeking to project their own nationalist ideals. Instead of concentrating on the politics of revolution and emancipation, articles that primarily women wrote related to the social life of the family reveal a consistent set of concerns tracing back to the mid-nineteenth century as well as forward to the first decades of the Guomindang period. Modernizing issues of professionalism, science, productive labor, philanthropy and public life were written about as reshaping the home. These articles encouraged the housewife to incorporate foreign models of time management, financial administration, and labor relations into her domestic routine. They instructed her in germ theory and contemporary nutritional guidelines. They insisted that the only way for her to be patriotic and public-minded was to earn an income and to lead social reform campaigns. Domestic discourse also remained connected to more traditional understandings of women's activities as household managers. Ancient texts, such as the Great Learning (Da xue), classical conceptions of the family model of the state, and the construction of separate spheres around the inner realm (nei) and the outer domain (wai) were all Confucian resources for some modern housewives. Even the slogan, good wife, wise mother (liangqi xianmu), a modern translation of the Confucian ideal, was embraced positively by many women as they endeavored to claim relevance for themselves in the emerging new social order of the early Republican era. The woman-centered reading recovered in this research shows how domestic life was variously conceived in Shanghai women's periodicals. Moreover, it suggests that the relationship between domestic and public feminism in early twentieth century China gave private space new public meanings that resonated with global patterns while retaining indigenous specificity.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Southern California,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, Bourgeois, China, Domestic sphere, Gender, Nationalism, Shanghai",16,Los Angeles,California,34.1141,-118.4068,United States
304389793,"Yu, Hsiao-yun",Political party transformation in the context of nation-state democratization: The case of the Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan,Contemporary,"For forty-seven years, Taiwan was a one-party authoritarian state under the control of the Kuomintang (KMT), which Chiang Kai-shek installed after the 1949 communist revolution in mainland China. In 1986, Chiang's son Chiang Ching-kuo, who had become head of state on the death of elder Chiang in 1978, initiated a series of reforms that ushered in multiparty politics. By 1996, with the first popular presidential election in five thousand years of Chinese history, Taiwan's democratic opening was said to have been complete. While the KMT was the prime mover of political reform in Taiwan, it remained in control of executive government and retained an absolute parliamentary majority through these years. As political pluralism transformed Taiwan, the KMT changed, too--in party ideology, structure, membership, and political role. As democratization continues to unfold, the party is likely to continue to change. This study explores the interplay of Taiwan's journey of democratization and the behavior of the KMT as a political institution. It examines whether the KMT participates in good-faith efforts to strengthen the institutions of democracy in Taiwan, or can be seen as engaged in a constant fight for absolute one-party political control. Looking toward the future, it asks if the KMT will respond creatively to the vicissitudes of a competitive political environment or weaken from within, succumbing to internal factionalism. This study focuses on these issues, with comparative reference to two other cases of one-party rule in a context of democratic transition, the PRI in Mexico and the LDP in Japan. The findings of this study suggest that the institutionalization of democratic process within the KMT has to be the primary mission in the democratic transformation of both the KMT and Taiwan. As a predominant party, the KMT will have to behave as a responsible political institution (of good accountability, integrity, and credibility), in order to maintain its political power, as well as its governance longevity and legitimacy in Taiwan.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,University of Southern California,NA,NA,"Political science, History, China, party transformation",16,Los Angeles,California,34.1141,-118.4068,United States
304824131,"Chang, Chia-Lan",Family matters: Women's negotiation with Confucian family ethics in Qing and republican China,Contemporary,"This dissertation explores how individual women in Qing (1644–1911) and Republican (1912–1949) Quanzhou, a port city in the Fujian province, preserved the male-centered family system yet empowered themselves within it by negotiating with Confucian family ethics. Focusing on gender and family, this study explores how Quanzhou women utilized legal powers, concepts of morality, family status, and community connections as cultural and social capital in pursuit of their own interests. Chapter 1 presents the historical development of Chinese family ethics. The gap between orthodox principles of patrilineality and local practices gave women an opportunity to wield power in their families. Chapters 2 and 3 describe women’s engagement with the contractual tradition. They show the decreasing influence of agnates and the growing independence of women and their conjugal units. Women used their legal powers and parental authority to further their self interests and that of their families. Chapter 4 uses public notices in newspapers in the 1930s and 1940s to analyze disputes between men and women, and older and younger generations. In these notices, women claimed to be virtuous and appealed to public opinion among the readers to guarantee their economic security in the family. Meanwhile, husbands and in-laws displayed their anxiety about women’s loss of female virtue and used the 1931 Family Law to evict young widows from households and take their property. Chapter 5 details how women created fictive family ties outside of their kin organizations. Many women entered local monastic orders or justified their marriage-resisting practices by highlighting their filiality, chastity, and by conceptualizing a form of social motherhood. They maintained strong ties with their natal families and developed fictive mother-daughter bonds between religious instructors and disciples. Quanzhou women did not abandon Confucian family ethics, but they manipulated concepts of virtue to benefit their own practical kin groups and legitimized unorthodox religious practices. They thus enhanced both their family status and their own authority. The process of negotiation reveals an interconversion of their female virtues, family status, property rights, and social reputation. Most women chose to stay within the family system and acted as the protectresses of Confucian patrilineality and patriarchy.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of Southern California,East Asian Languages and Cultures,East Asian Studies,"Religious history, History, China, Confucianism, Ethics, Family, Property contract, Public notice, Qing dynasty, Quanzhou, Religion, Republican, Women",16,Los Angeles,California,34.1141,-118.4068,United States

This dissertation examines the story of the Shanghai Jews from the Chinese and Japanese perspectives and in so doing sheds new light on the complicated relationships among China, Japan, Germany, and the United States before and during the war. When the European Jews first arrived in Shanghai in the summer of 1938, the Chinese were desperately combating the invading Japanese. Both the Chinese government and Japanese occupation authorities thought carefully about the Jews and attempted to use them to attract capital from the international Jewish community in order to fund their war with each another. In early 1939, the Nationalist Government adopted Sun Ke's plan to establish a Jewish settlement for the refugees in Southwestern China. At the same time, Chinese leaders hoped to attract financial support from world, especially American, Jewry, so that they could continue, and eventually prevail in, their resistance against Japan. However, China was still nominally an ally of Germany at the time and had to be aware of Berlin's reaction to this plan. Nevertheless, after American Jewish leaders enthusiastically embraced the settlement plan and promised to convince the Roosevelt administration to support China financially, Chinese officials gradually abandoned their concerns about Germany. The Japanese, on the other hand, instead of adopting Nazi Germany's policy of eliminating the Jews, attempted to exploit their purported financial and political power in III the service of Japan's war in East Asia. With the Shanghai Jews under their control, the Japanese believed that the international Jewish community would not be able to involve itself in anti-Japanese activities, and American Jewish leaders would work to pressure the Roosevelt administration on Japan's behalf. However, after the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy in September 1940, pro-German elements in the military and government gained power and demanded that Japan's policy change toward the Shanghai Jewish refugees.

In order to frame the historical and pedagogical context for this study, the earlier part of the dissertation provides a brief description of Confucian education, explains the importance of modelling as a pedagogical technique in art and life in Chinese society and discusses the process of hero formation. Methodologically this monograph combines archival research with participant observation and selected in-depth interviews as a means to understand the mechanisms by which Chinese have internalized the Lei Feng message over three decades (1960s-1990s). These mechanisms include a variety of indoctrination techniques inside and outside of schools including stories, songs, copybooks, his diary, his biography, movies, plays, exhibitions, campaigns and numerous learn from Lei Feng activities. Included are a brief biography and an analysis of the characteristics of the biography which mark it as an example of socialist ideology. Over the last three decades there have been significant changes in Chinese society which have reordered priorities and contributed to changing perceptions of the role model: (1) As a result of adjustments in the economic and educational spheres, the virtuocratic reward system has shifted toward meritocracy. (2) Disillusionment with official culture and political instability have contributed to a crisis of faith. (3) The open door has encouraged lateral comparisons which are shifting the focus away from traditional historical and internal comparisons. All of these factors have altered the meaning of Lei Feng. Finally, the dissertation posits the emergence of a new socialist humanism which is evident in the writing of modern Chinese authors and in the language of many of the interviewees. The choice of individual Chinese to construct their own versions of a caregiving Lei Feng and reject the obedient, slavish official version promoted by the Party and the military is indicative of this new social philosophy and suggests that there is a growing civic culture which is quite independent of socialist dogma.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,University of Virginia,NA,NA,"History, Political science, Biographies, Education history, Social structure, China, socialism",5,Charlottesville,Virginia,38.0375,-78.4855,United States
305406287,"Fisher, Nevan Andrew",A house divided: Christmas church and the Protestant community of Anqing,Contemporary,"Despite renewed interest in the Chinese Church, few, if any, academic studies thoroughly document the life of a single Chinese Christian community in all of its permutations, during its entire history. Certainly, the process by which a Christian community survived (or ceased to survive) after the forced expulsion of Western missionaries has not been thoroughly studied. And the local church in post-Maoist China—arguably the period of greatest interest to academics because of Protestantism's enormous growth rate and spread—has received scant attention insofar as this community of faith is conditioned by its past. This dissertation examines the history and development of Protestant Christianity in Anqing, Anhui Province, with particular attention to local Church leadership in the post-Mao era. I contend that individuals and interpersonal relationships assume greater priority than ecclesiastical structures or carefully defined hierarchies of power. As a result, the patron-client relationship has become the predominant means by which the leadership of the local Church has developed and by which the mantle of power is transferred. This system, in which guanxi (connections or relations) takes precedence over institutions, can pose many problems for Protestantism: informal ties can circumnavigate clear chains of command, and personality conflicts can assume disproportionate influence on church affairs. Certainly, the presence of guanxi and other clientelist ties is not always detrimental to the health of the local Church. In fact, it can sometimes be quite useful. Personal ties with government officials play an essential role in maintaining good relationships with the various state bureaucracies. These relationships have even allowed church leaders to call upon “friendly” officials for preferential treatment or for the speedy resolution of conflict with other agencies. In light of these developments, it is essential for the pastor and other leaders of the official church to enter into a carefully constructed relationship with the state. Though positive ties with the state can produce short-term gains for official church leaders, they can also produce long-term problems of legitimacy and compromise.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,University of Virginia,NA,NA,"History, Religious congregations, Anqing, China, Christmas church, Protestant community",5,Charlottesville,Virginia,38.0375,-78.4855,United States

Serving the court during a time of intense factional disputes, he was demoted and exiled. He was banished to Huangzhou from 1080-1084, to Huizhou from 1094-1097, and to Danzhou on Hainan Island from 1097 until he received amnesty in 1100. The themes of exile and return, prominent in Su Shi's corpus of poetry, are shown to illuminate an ambivalence in his attitudes toward service and retirement. His poetry is explicated in order to determine how he conceived of himself during times of exile and to analyze how he viewed his predicament. Chapter One is a review of the historical context of Su Shi's exiles. The causes of his exiles are then explained. Accounts of his journeys into exile, his adaptation to and transformation of the places of exile are given in Chapter Two. The adversities of deprivation, disgrace, and death are explored in Chapter Three. These are shown in relation to responses based on Su Shi's understanding of the Chinese philosophical and religious traditions. His effective use of imaginative in creating alternatives to the realities encountered is also explained. Su Shi and his writings are placed within the context of conventional literary figures and tropes in Chapter Four. Next his preference for identification with men in retirement, specifically with Tao Yuanming, is analyzed. Chapter Five also explains why Su Shi composed poetry to match the rhymes of Tao. In Chapter six, literature he composed during exile is seen in relation to his general corpus. The thesis concludes that Su Shi's initial ambivalence toward engagement and reclusion was intensified by the exile experience. The exile periods and the literature composed about exile and return are accorded their proper importance as factors contributing to the significance of Su Shi and his works in the history of Chinese literature.",1989,1989,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Comparative literature, History, China",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

This study traces the readership and interpretation of Yang Xiong's works and biography mapping the relationship between the history of a text and the history of the author. The first chapter explores the formative years of Yang Xiong reception and his move from mere scholar-recluse to sage, solidifying his place in the central tradition rather than the limited and regional. The second chapter explores the interplay between Yang Xiong's role as an astronomer and the increased readership of his Tai xuan jing in the context of developments in xuanxue . The third chapter focuses on the transitional period with the decline of xuanxue and the rise of new readership for Yang Xiong within the Guwen movement. The fourth chapter looks at the startling division in scholarly interpretation of Yang Xiong's works and actions in the Song dynasty (960-1279) and Yang Xiong's reestablishment on the regional landscape of his native Shu (in modern Sichuan). The final chapter outlines the developments that occurred after the Song and offers a broad set of conclusion for the whole of this study. Overall, this study reveals how changes in the understanding of the cosmos, the conception of human nature, Ruist practices, and the role of the sage blend in the reception history of Yang Xiong moving him across the geography of traditional elite society between the regional world of his native Shu and the imperial capital as his reception threads across the span of pre-modern Chinese intellectual history.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, Asian Studies, China, Confucianism, Han dynasty, Intellectual history, Reception history, Tai xuan jing, Yang, Xiong",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

Chapter 1 explores the textual history of the Chuenchiou and provides a critical review of pertinent Western scholarship. Chapter 2 examines the use of date notations and Chapters 3-5 contain a formal categorical analysis of all records of the same type. Records were written in accord with regular rules that governed which types of events could be recorded and in what form. Records of the same type of event were recorded using similar format, and formal rules determined choice of main verb, style of reference to individuals, order in which states were listed in events involving multiple states, and degree of specificity of date notation. Exceptional records are uncommon, although attempts to explain irregularities have been the focus of much of the exegetical tradition associated with the Chuenchiou . The Tzuoo juann contains a set of passages, examined in Chapter 6, that comment directly on the Chuenchiou records. Like other commentarial traditions associated with the Chuenchiou , these passages attempt to explain deviations from the regular form, and provide an alternative to the traditional praise and blame interpretation of the Gongyang and Guuliang traditions. Some irregularities are attributed to lack of information and others to scribal error. elsewhere, the Tzuoo suggests that recordkeepers intentionally departed from the regular form to indicate that the event being recorded was itself exceptional, including events that were morally irregular, events that were in some respect ritually deficient, and those that were simply strange or unusual. In the concluding chapter, Chapter 7, I suggest that variations from the standard form may have sometimes been employed as a vehicle for implying value judgments that could not be indicated explicitly in the Chuenchiou records.

Literary works by Cai Yong (132/133-192) and some of his contemporaries, Zhao Yi (ca. 130-ca. 185 C.E.), Zhu Mu (100-163 C.E.), and Zhang Chao, invest the tragic course of the times with a significance derived from a perception that these events signal a great change. some kind of ending is inevitable and imminent. In The Sense of an Ending, Frank Kermode describes kairos as a significant season ..., charged with a meaning derived from its relation to the end.

In this context we can call a literature that reveals its writers' beliefs about the future--their own fate or that of their society--by reflecting on and extrapolating from their memories of past events and perceptions of present circumstances, kairotic literature. The epoch of 159-192 witnessed the emergence of a kairotic literature.

305017862,"Wang, Zhuoyi",Revolutionizing the silver screen a user-centered discursive study of early PRC cinema: 1949-59,Contemporary,"Euro-American critical literature on Chinese cinema has long developed a strong preference for two separate eras, the pre-1949 period and the post-1984 period. The thirty-five years in between, and the continuities among these three periods, have received little attention. Moreover, with a few exceptions, this limited research usually overlooks the diversities both within and beyond the film industry, and takes Communist films as monolithic and univocal, representing state ideology and serving Party propaganda only. In this dissertation, I work to fill in this gap. Following Rick Altman's theory, I argue that meanings of films in general and of early PRC films in particular must be understood on the discursive level as contingent products of ongoing multipartite negotiations on how to use the texts. With a focus on the first decade of the PRC from 1949 to 1959, I delineate how the continuous anti-elite revolution created rapid power shifts in both the cultural leadership and filmmaking ranks, analyze the diverse, and often opposing filmmaking legacies interplaying with each other in the 1950s, and examine how conflicts and compromises among multiple agents, including mainly diverse groups of film artists, Party authorities, and critics, complicated the ways to use early PRC films. Based on this large-scale historical research, I propose a shift in framework of analysis to a user-centered discursive study to approach the revolutionary cinema. In particular, I will analyze the diverse and shifting uses of four films in early PRC: Song Jingshi (1957), The Unfinished Comedy (1957), Blooming Flowers and Full Moon (1958) and Nie Er (1959).",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"Comparative literature, History, Film studies, China, Chinese Revolution, Early PRC cinema, Maoist period, Political campaigns",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

Retrospective accounts, comparison of longitudinally administered structured interviews, and field observations provided the measures of changes in practice, and of participants' abilities to perceive such changes. Results demonstrate that, although practices are not uniformly labile, there were many practices in which statistically significant levels of change were observed across two generations of parents. This research also provides evidence about parents' abilities to perceive changes in socialization practices and about their abilities to accurately recall their own practices after 35 years. Although given individuals may feel strongly about socialization practices, the freedom with which some practices have changed and the limits of people's ability to recall their practices over time suggests that most socialization practices (including some that this research demonstrated to be relatively stable) are situationally appropriate responses to presenting circumstances rather than ideologically enduring practices. Thus, this research suggests a dynamic model of socialization practices—one which has every thing to do with how Taiwanese parents of any generation respond to new conditions—rather than fixed formulae for the training of children.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, History, Social structure, China, Life changes, Taipei, Taiwan, Urban border",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
304321582,"Cheung, Siu-woo",Subject and representation: Identity politics in southeast Guizhou,Contemporary,"This thesis investigates identity politics among some diverse native groups in southwest China in the making of the contemporary Chinese nation-state. It explores the processes by which these groups in and outside the province of Guizhou were merged to form the Miao ethnic minority in various forms during the late imperial period, the Nationalist regime, and the People's Republic, whereas the Ge in Southeast Guizhou struggled against the official classification which has considered them as Miao since the 1950s. A particular focus is on a social movement launched by the Ge elite to appeal for recognition as a unitary minority during the post-Mao reforms through the construction of new local histories, the resurrection of ritual practices, and the staging of cultural performances for tourists. The analysis of these historical processes allows the author to explicate how the minority subject in contemporary China has been constituted, defined and negotiated through subjects' interactions with particular authorities under specific social and historical conditions. how dominant discourses have worked to standardize ethnicity. and how identity politics among the natives has contributed to the entrenchment of the ethnicity model that has shaped the social order on the margins of the Chinese nation-state. The author approaches the issues of identity politics by exploring how representational practices constitute the subject under specific historical and social conditions. He finds that the dominant authority, through its discursive representations, postulates subject-positions that define individuals in terms of specific power relationships with the authority. yet it is through self-representation that individuals transform those subject-positions into conscious identity. The main task of this thesis is to investigate how native elites undertook self-representation in relation to dominant discursive representation to define themselves under specific historical and social conditions, and how they subsequently promoted their acquired vision of identity in the native community. This politics of representation worked to fix the multiple and non-fixed subject, yet the author also explicates how the condensation of identity proceeded through the mediation of multiple subject-positions--such as kinship, class and gender--in the Ge social movement, sometimes in orchestration and sometimes in contestation.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, Political science, History, China, Ge, Miao",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
304531014,"Han, Almaz Xuefeng","Split identities: Making minzu/ethnic subjects in Inner Mongolia, People's Republic of China",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the processes that have transformed the Mongols of Inner Mongolia from a formerly relatively independent people in the pre-communist era to a socialist ethnic citizenry signified by the official term or name shaoshu minzu (“minority nationality”) under the People's Republic of China (PRC). The dissertation argues that this metamorphosis has meant more than structural alteration and obliteration of the traditional Mongol socio-political order. More profoundly, it signifies the emergence and formation of a new and fragmented Mongol subjectivity and identity. This new subjectivity is deeply inscribed by the State's cultural politics and nation-building agendas, by the needs and desires of the dominant (Han) society, by the competing claims of variously positioned socio-regional groupings of Inner Mongols, and by such transnational forces as the existence of the independent state of Mongolia. For a fruitful and fresh theoretical approach the author terms the above processes as minzufication . Above all, the author argues that this process of minzufication has not only created the Inner Mongol ethnic subject, but also opened up possibilities for resistance and negotiation not available to them before. In analyzing the issues in question, the author provides a series of in-depth case studies that include the hegemonic discourses of minzu and Zhonghua minzu , the symbolism of Chinggis Khan, Mongol wrestling as a cultural-political practice, the dominant representation of Mongols as timeless nomads, and Mongolia as an imaginary homeland to Inner Mongols.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, Social structure, History, China, Ethnic, Identities, Inner Mongolia, Minzu/ethnic, Mongols",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
304635334,"McNeal, Robin Patrick","Acquiring people: Social organization, mobilization, and discourse on the Civil and the Martial in ancient China",Ancient,"This work is a study of various aspects of the Eastern Zhou concept of “acquiring people.” The hypothesis is that people were the most valuable resource during this period of constant warfare, growth and consolidation, and inter-lineage struggle. From the seventh century B.C., the scale of warfare increased dramatically, placing enormous burdens on states to field and feed larger armies, as well as engage in massive public works and defensive construction. To achieve these goals, states needed wealth and soldiers. The source of both was a large, settled, governable populace. States needed new ways to extract more resources from the land and populace they already held, and ways to increase their holdings and number of subjects. More people meant more farmers working the land to feed armies, more families paying taxes to pay for outfitting these armies, more couples producing sons to provide corvee labor and serve as conscripts. In short, human capital was the source of a state's wealth and strength. Acquiring, settling, and employing larger and larger numbers of people required many new policies and institutions, ranging from grain relief and famine control measures to new forms of social organization and procedures for registering the population that aided mobilization for war. Behind these new political tools was an emerging ideology that categorized all such state activities into the Civil and the Martial, the wen and wu . These two spheres were inseparable halves of the Eastern Zhou political dynamic. By the fourth century B.C. the Civil and Martial were understood to alternate, the Martial being employed to subjugate unruly enemies, the Civil then being applied to settle and rule them. Such a conception represents a highly developed understanding of the coercive and psychological means of acquiring people, securing their loyalty, and employing them to the benefit of the state.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, Asian literature, China, Civil, Discourse, Martial, Mobilization, Social organization",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
814468490,"Van Lieu, Joshua John",Divergent Visions of Serving the Great: The Emergence of Choso˘n-Qing Tributary Relations as a Politics of Representation,Modern,"From the 1870s to the 1890s, the interactions of Chosoˇn and Qing diplomats were closely watched. Seeking to advance their own interests, the Japanese, Americans, British, and Russians closely examined the exchange of envoys and the flow of communications in search of an explanation of the Qing-Chosoˇn relationship. Chosoˇn-Qing relations became in this period the subject of international inquiry, a phenomenon for investigation, the object of a Western diplomatic gaze. The Qing government viewed foreign interest in Chosoˇn with alarm and concluded that the existing relationship with Chosoˇn was insufficient to address its security concerns. By the 1880s, the Chosoˇn and Qing governments began to negotiate a new relationship to jointly address the evolving geopolitical dynamics of the region. This re-negotiation of more than two-hundred years of diplomatic precedent was made especially complex by the fact that Qing and Chosoˇn officials were keenly aware of external observation. Potential foreign interpretations were an explicit concern in their policy considerations. It was in these circumstances that Qing and Chosoˇn leaders transformed tributary practice into a politics of representation through which they attempted to redefine themselves and one another through highly public performances explicitly for the consumption of observing Western powers. Historians have suggested that in this period Chosoˇn was a traditional tributary while others have written of a hybrid arrangement in which Chosoˇn simultaneously participated in a Qing tributary system and a Western treaty system. For some the new relations constituted a strengthening of a traditional tributary relationship while yet others have posited a complete collapse of tributary relations. Despite the disparate positions of these works they are united by a common element: the reification of the tributary relationship independent of the contemporary discourses through which it was constituted. The Chosoˇn-Qing relationship of the 1880s and 1890s, however, was inseparable from the Western diplomatic gaze and the conscious redeployment of tribute as a politics of representation. These representations have had a lasting influence on Western understandings of Qing-Chosoˇn relations and notions of tradition and modernity in East Asia. These are the central propositions to which this dissertation is devoted.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, International Relations, China, Choson dynasty, Korea, Orientalism, Qing dynasty, Representation, Sino-Korean relations, Tributary relations",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

304142767,"Fairbank, Anthony Bruce",Ssu-ma I (179-251): Wei statesman and Chin founder. An historiographical inquiry,Ancient,"Ssu-ma I (179-251) was one of the great military and political figures of third century China. He served the Ts'ao imperial house for over thirty-five years, and died as the de facto Prime Minister of the Ts'ao Wei state (220-266). yet he is known to history primarily as the founding emperor of the subsequent Chin dynasty (266-420), a status first conferred upon him fourteen and a half years after his death. A proper assessment of Ssu-ma I's role in history must confront the contradiction between his actual position as a Wei statesman and his posthumous designation as a Chin emperor. An investigation into this problem reveals that it stems from the traditional historical portrayal of this man. In an effort to understand the complex historiographical strata pertaining to Ssu-ma I's life and career, this dissertation traces the evolution of the historical record pertaining to Ssu-ma I as it evolved from the third century to the seventh. During this time, the image of Ssu-ma I as the Chin dynastic founder took shape and was codified by T'ang historiographers of the mid-seventh century in the first chapter of the imperially commissioned Chin shu (History of the Chin), a work which is still extant. The dissertation consists of two parts. The first, which is made up of six chapters, traces the history of historical writing about Ssu-ma I from the production of primary documents during his lifetime through the compilation of the Chin shu during the early T'ang dynasty. By tracing the development of these records, it is possible to see the growing importance dynastic history writing came to have in the Chinese historiographical tradition, and how this shaped the view of Ssu-ma I as a dynastic founder rather than a Wei statesman. The second part of the dissertation, consisting of two chapters, constitutes a translation and study of Chin shu 1, the Annals of Emperor Hsuan. This document is the only complete extant account which treats Ssu-ma I as its main subject, and is therefore a source of primary importance for the study of Ssu-ma I. The first of the two chapters consists of an annotated translation of this account, while the second undertakes a study of the makeup of the chapter, and reveals how the T'ang compilers drew upon previous materials, and shaped them for their own purposes. The Annals of Emperor Hsuan is shown to be an account which seeks to portray Ssu-ma I as an exemplary general and statesman, but also criticizes him for being part of the eventual demise of the Wei dynasty. The portrayal of Ssu-ma I which has come down to us is therefore a contradictory one. On the one hand, he is shown to be a great leader, as all dynastic founders should be. but on the other hand, he is linked with the eclipse of the Wei dynasty and is therefore portrayed as a vicious and ultimately disloyal statesman. It is the conclusion of this study that a proper account of Ssu-ma I must recognize and look beyond the dynastic ideology which has permeated the historiographical treatment of this man since the late third century. Only then will it be possible to sift through the historical evidence and reconstruct a balanced view of this important third century figure.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, Biographies, China",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
304322079,"Dai, Yingcong","The rise of the Southwestern frontier under the Qing, 1640-1800",Modern,"This dissertation is a study of the domestic impact of the Qing dynasty's frontier strategies during the first half of the dynasty (1640-1800). It examines how the vigorous Qing frontier undertakings during this period played a significant role in shaping and maintaining the Qing policies towards the Southwest of China, namely, Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and explores how these policies functioned in the making of the particular socio-economic structure in this region. This study examines the change of the position of the Southwest in the strategic considerations of the Qing authorities. In the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the lack of both economic and strategic importance in the Southwest led the central government to neglect this region. This neglect caused the slow recovery from war devastation in the Southwest. The strategic importance of the Southwest grew with the unfolding of the intricate relationships between the Qing empire and the Tibetan authorities. When the Qing realized at the end of the seventeenth century that Tibetan affairs were central to both settling the Zunghar threat in the Northwest and pacifying the Mongol hordes in Mongolia and Kokonor, they began to build a strong military base area in the Southwest. This study demonstrates that militarization was of great significance to social and economic developments in the region. In order to retain adequate resources in the region to support military buildup and frontier campaigns, the central government deemphasized revenue collection from the Southwest. The low taxation provided the most important stimulus to the development of the region. Private merchants and regional elites capitalized on this, making the Southwest a major rice exporter from the 1720s to the 1790s. The Qing state encouraged and protected the circulation of rice to the lower Yangtze valley. This attitude of the Qing state towards marketing systems exemplifies its flexibility in directing the economic life of the country.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, China",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

It is argued that there were two types of state expansion at work during this century. First, intensive or juridical state expansion began shortly after the Manchus occupied Beijing in 1644. The purpose of intensive expansion was to increase Beijing's political-legal control over the frontier societies situated along China's periphery. Second, extensive or physical state expansion emerged late in the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) and continued, albeit in markedly different forms, throughout the Yongzheng (1723-1735) and Qianlong (1736-1796) reigns. This study tracts the motives and methods of extensive state expansion into two frontier areas, the external frontier of Eastern Tibet (mDos-Kham) and the internal frontier of southeast Guizhou, during the Kangxi-Yongzheng and Yongzheng-Qianlong transitions. This dissertation will show that the motives and methods of early Qing state expansion differed not only with regards to the two frontiers in question, but also in how each emperor approached the important core-periphery question: What type of relationship should Beijing have with the non-Han Chinese societies living along China's borders?",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, China",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
304809853,"Akcetin, Elif",Corruption at the frontier: The Gansu fraud scandal,Contemporary,"Based on an examination of the Gansu fraud scandal that was unveiled in 1781, this dissertation seeks to provide a re-evaluation of the concept of corruption in the context of the late eighteenth century Qing dynasty. It is argued that corruption was not a fixed category, but was a fluid and changing arena where the Qing central government and provincial officials negotiated its content and parameters. In addition to this, the ambiguity of the concept of corruption during this period was further enhanced by the fact that there was no clear distinction between public ( gong ) and private ( si ). An important aspect of corruption in the period in question is that it was a reflection of the specific type of state-making in the border province of Gansu. The examination of Qing territorial administration of Gansu has illustrated that it was ironically the Qing state's latitudinarian policies towards Gansu's administration that facilitated stronger ties among Gansu officials. Following the conquest of Xinjiang, the Qing state opted to increase the power of the Shaanxi and Gansu governor general. The disclosure of the Gansu scandal and the ensuing imperial response represented an extension of these flexible policies in Gansu. It was a reaffirmation of the central government's power in the province. Moreover, the Qianlong emperor used the case to communicate his granary policy to the bureaucracy. The commercialization of Gansu represented the other facet of the Gansu corruption case. Rapid commercialization stimulated by the conquest of Xinjiang, as well as state policies that encouraged merchant involvement in the local economy generated new opportunities for local officials. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the boundary between merchants and officials became gradually blurred. An increasing number of officials in the northwest cemented their ties by means of their involvement in local and interregional trade. Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no singular vantage point from which to comprehend and interpret the Gansu corruption case. It is rather argued that it is more suitable to view the events of 1781 in the light of numerous converging factors which are expounded in each chapter, and which constitute the whole of the story.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, China, China, history, Corruption, Fraud, Gansu, Gansu fraud scandal, Material culture, Qianlong",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

This study examines the formation of a large network of estates in western Shandong under the administrative control of the dukes and the social implications of the rise of the canal trade and the increasing integration of estate lands into this market economy. The socioeconomic tensions that accompanied these regional economic changes underlay the political conflicts that erupted between the Kong dukes and their opponents in the city of Qufu. County magistrates, in particular, often served as the foci around which ducal opposition attempted to mobilize. Along with the coercive aspects of economic and political domination, the dukes supported an equally aggressive campaign in the cultural realm in an effort both to subjugate narratives produced by the opposition and to cultivate a measure of consent among the ruled. Writing about the family past and controlling the articulation and practice of ritual forms were central aspects of this project, and this dissertation attempts to interrogate the historical development of these efforts throughout the late imperial period.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, China, Confucius, Culture, Descendents, Kong family, Ming dynasty, Power, Qing dynasty",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
304644135,"Udry, Stephen Potter",Muttering mystics: A preliminary examination of Manchu Shamanism in the Qing dynasty,Modern,"This is a study of the shamanisms of the Manchus during the Qing dynasty, and primarily of shamanic performances within the ritual spaces maintained by the Qing court. As such, it is a study of the shamanisms of a people whose ancestral homelands, in today's northeastern region of China, reached into the region said to be the home of “classical shamanism.” Furthermore the term “shaman” comes to us from the languages of this area of the world, particularly the Tunguso-manchurian dialect. Focusing on eight texts in particular, this study resolves the tension that arose from the several highly differentiated types of shamanic rituals which the Manchus practiced during the Qing. In the process three Manchu shamanisms are defined: “healing” shamanism, clan shamanism and Tangse shamanism. This study explicitly links the three strands via common elements, including symbolic and material implements as well as personnel involved. Furthermore, by allowing a focus on the development and performance of the rites within two of the ritual spaces used by the Oing court, the tri-furcation of Manchu shamanisms revealed the relation between the shamanisms practiced by the Qing court and those of the non-imperial clans. These spaces, the Kunning Gong and the Tangse , each witnessed the performance of shamanisms which were related closely to the shamanic practices of non-imperial Manchu clans. The ceremonies held within the Kunning Gong were, at base, elaborate versions of the rites which constituted Manchu clan shamanism. The principle differences between the rites in the Kunning Gong and those of other Manchu clans were the frequency of performance, number of actors, and the quality and quantity of the offerings. The Tangse , however, was a ritual arena unique to the imperial clan and as such the ceremonies performed within comprised a distinct type of shamanism. The rites of Tangse shamanism were rooted in the rites of Manchu clan shamanism but grew into rites suited to the needs of rulers of a multi-ethnic state.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, China, Court ritual, Manchu, Qing dynasty, Shamanism",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
305301401,"Zhang, Cong",The culture of travel in Song China (960–1276),Medieval,"During the Song period (960–1276), Chinese educated men frequently left their native places spending much of their adult life traveling from place to place. The pursuit of examination success and official careers motivated most of this travel. This study examines three aspects of this phenomenon, the material basis of travel and the state's role in mobilizing its elite, the travelers' preoccupations on the road and responses to lives constantly in transit, and the implications of this elite travel for the places visited. My research shows that empire-wide trips taken by scholar-officials were readily supported by a nationwide communication system and generous government assistance. In its intention to exert control of its elite by limiting lengths and locations of service, the Song state provided its scholar-officials with ample opportunities to visit locales other than their native places and the capital. These trips not only prepared Song elite to become local administrators, the constant physical relocation inspired a large amount of literary production, helped build up social networks, and created occasions for sightseeing and physical contacts with places of interests. My research finds that all these were highly valued by Song travelers as means to personal cultivation, scholarly excellence, and concrete connection with China's past. The shared experience of travel also helped to solidify the group identity of the national elite and to distinguish these national scholar-officials from the local elite. The travelers' efforts in representing and refashioning famous sites throughout China created a spatial and visual discourse on China's past. Taken as a whole, Song scholar-officials' preoccupation with sightseeing and marking places reflected their efforts to identify the central elements of their cultural heritage and promote their own legacy, thereby permanently changing China's cultural geography and historical memory.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, China, Culture, Song dynasty, Travel",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

304531075,"Anderson, James Adams",Frontier management and tribute relations along the Empire's southern border: China and Vietnam in the 10th and 11th centuries,Medieval,"From the founding of the Song dynasty (960–1279), the Chinese court at Kaifeng treated the Viêt people of the Hông River Delta differently from other neighboring societies that supported or competed with the new Chinese leadership. Sino-Viêt relations were necessarily a complicated affair, because the northern Viêt region had been an integral part of the Chinese political and cultural empire for nearly one thousand years. The system of Sino-Viêt relations prior to the Song had been one of a central government directly linked to a web of subordinate local governments. However, the influences of local politics and regional trade during the 10 th and 11 th centuries led to a transformation of Sino-Viêt relations, establishing points of contact beyond the control of a central Chinese authority. Eventually, the Song court itself would draw on the precedent of Zhou Dynasty (1122–221 BCE) feudalism or Five Dynasties Period (907–960) frontier management, and not Tang Dynasty (618–905) hegemony, to produce the new terms of interaction. This study demonstrates that Sino-Viêt relations of the Song period should be distinguished from the relationships of the northern kingdoms within the “multi-state” Chinese empire and from the Sinocentric tribute relations that other Southeast Asian kingdoms would establish with the Song court Meanwhile, Viêt rulers used the evolving relationship with China to set the foundations for their own base of power. Local leaders from the Sino-Viêt border region at first appeared to follow the wishes of the Chinese by sending tribute missions to China and by accepting official titles granted by the Song court. However, formal acceptance of pronouncements from the Chinese court did not imply that Viêt leaders had abandoned their local political concerns. Soon after the Song's founding, a Viêt military commander declared locally his region's independence and adopted for himself the title “Ever Victorious King.” The emerging Viêt political order was shaped by an interplay between Chinese signs of authority expressed through the tribute system and local Viêt responses to and adaptations of these signs. Attempts by both the Song and Đai Cô Viêt (968–1054) courts to push conflicts between minority ethnic groups across the Sino-Viêt frontier accented this reconfiguring of the Sino-Viêt relationship.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, China, Eleventh century, Frontier management, Tenth century, Tribute relations, Vietnam",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
304532396,"Han, Hongkoo",Wounded nationalism: The Minsaengdan Incident and Kim Il Sung in eastern Manchuria,Contemporary,"In north Korea, history does not belong to the past, but governs the present. The study of the guerrilla struggle in Manchuria—the historical origins of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—can provide us with significant clues to understanding modern north Korean politics. This dissertation attempts to offer an alternative explanation to the conventional understanding of north Korea's extraordinary personality cult and extreme emphasis on the nationalism by illuminating the specific circumstances of the Korean communist guerrillas in eastern Manchuria. In the early 1930s, the Eastern Manchurian Special Committee of the Chinese Communist Party purged more than 1,000 Korean communists with false charges of their association with the Minsaengdan, a pro-Japanese Korean organization. Since all victims of the purge were Korean, the Minsaengdan Incident may seem to be an ethnic persecution. However, it was a more complicated incident to be simply defined as an ethnic persecution. It was a, case of political paranoia that resulted from extensive changes in the environment of peasant life. The Korean masses in the guerrilla base areas were victimizers as well as victims of the purge. The Minsaengdan Incident is important in itself because it illuminates important aspects of the Korean communist movement in Manchuria, the nature of the communist purges, the collective madness amidst of the revolutionary process, and the conflicting relationship between communism and nationalism. However, the greatest significance of the Incident lies in its long lasting influence on north Korea and its “Great Leader” Kim Il Sung. Kim was arrested as a Minsaengdan suspect by the CCP, but was only a hair’s breadth away from execution. Later, he played a decisive role in bringing an end to this horrendous, purge which almost wiped out the Korean communist movement in eastern Manchuria. In the process, he built incontestable leadership among the Korean guerrillas under the CCP. If we fail to understand Kim and his followers’ collective memory of the Minsaengdan Incident, we cannot understand why Kim so fixated on the independence of the Korean people and created a family state based on a close personal bond he had established with his followers.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, China, Kim Il Sung, Korea, Manchuria, Minsaengdan Incident, Nationalism",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

It has three parts. Part I consists of first two chapters. It describes the development of heavy industry and ordinance industry under the National Resources Commission and the Bureau of Ordinance. It documents the Nationalist effort to develop heavy industry and ordinance industry after the Japanese occupation of Manchuria and the major development of the two industries during the Sino-Japanese War. It demonstrates (1) Japanese aggression and the war of resistance led to these developments, and (2) the dominant position of state enterprise in the twentieth century was first established during the wartime period. Part II consists of chapter three. It analyzes the evolution of bureaueratic organization of state enterprise in heavy industry and ordinance industry. Although bureaucratic organization of state enterprise had a longer tradition in ordinance industry, major changes occurred in both ordinance industry and heavy industry during the 1930s, as manifested in the expansion of bureaucratic organization and the replacement of traditional bureaucrats by technocrats trained in the modern education system. These changes led to the formation of administrative factory in the state enterprises. Part III provides a systematic analysis of the emergence and development of institutions of social service and industrial welfare. It shows that these institutions emerged in the late 1920s as a result of protective labor legislation, welfare capitalism, and a current of social reform. It also demonstrates that major development and expansion took place during the Sino-Japanese War. Within the state enterprises in heavy industry and ordinance industry, the institutions of social service and welfare facilities included dormitory and dining hall, school, hospital, consumer's cooperative, and even factory-run farm. It concludes that conditions of social environment, high labor turnover, and rising inflation were responsible for these developments.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, International law, International relations, China, Institutional pattern, Sino-Japanese War, State enterprise",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

This is a crucial period during which relations between the two nations were transformed in response to dramatic changes in the Cold War in East Asia, especially Sino-American rapprochement. A series of political agreements—normalization of relations in 1972, the signing of a peace treaty in 1978, and the beginning of Japanese economic aid to China in 1979—laid the basis for cooperative relations between Japan and China in the 1980s and early 1990s. Yet the way in which Japanese interpreted and responded to these changes went beyond the question of what Japan's policy toward the PRC ought to be. The debate regarding policy toward China was always part of a larger 'China problem' in postwar Japan that revolved around the contentious issue of what the state of relations with China revealed about Japanese national identity. The China problem in postwar Japan was a contest to interpret and thereby appropriate relations with the PRC as part of a domestic Japanese struggle to define national identity. The establishment of cooperative Sino-Japanese relations in the in 1970s depended not only on changes in the international political environment, but also in part upon a transformation in the place of the PRC and relations with China in Japanese nationalist discourse. Whereas up until the early 1970s support for closer relations with the PRC generally supported a progressive nationalist narrative opposed to the conservative postwar political order and alliance with the United States, by the end of the decade the promotion of Sino-Japanese cooperation became a crucial component of a conservative nationalist narrative that called for more assertive foreign and defense policies and an affirmative view of modern Japanese history. At the same time, the most vocal criticism of Japanese government policy toward China was taken up by the right-wing of the conservative camp. Thus, the changes in discourse on the China problem supported cooperative relations between the two countries but also contained the discursive elements that underlie contemporary conflict.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, Modern history, International law, China, History--China, History--Japan, Japan, Nationalism, Postwar, Sino-Japanese relations",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

Because the Zongli Yamen was established in 1861 to manage foreign affairs throughout the Qing empire, it acted as both a central government agency and the head of a vast network of local administrations. By its institutional placement, the Zongli Yamen reflected high level efforts to control foreign affairs from Beijing. In its capacity as coordinator of the complex events of local foreign affairs, the Zongli Yamen interacted with local and provincial officials in ways that revealed the truly local nature of much of the late Qing's foreign relations. An examination of communications and efforts devoted to resolving foreign affairs issues reveals central government operations vis-à-vis local and provincial operations and demonstrates how Qing foreign policy was created by both top-down and bottom up processes. This thesis first focuses on the use of imperial commissioners as a manifestation of Ong flexibility and precursor to the Zongli Yamen. Next, it examines how the leaders of the new institution reorganized administrative jurisdictions to create a viable foreign affairs administration. Studies of two types of Zongli Yamen cases-local negotiations with foreigners and foreign incursions in prohibited areas and activities-are then presented in order to analyze and determine the roles of the Yamen ministers in Beijing, as well as the roles of local and provincial officials. In part, this thesis is an attempt to bring the state back into late Ong history in a manner that incorporates the methods and questions of the recent social and local histories that have so enriched Ong history. In part, it is an effort to better understand the relationships and interactions among the various levels of the Ong bureaucracy in order to add depth to our understanding of Ong political operations. It concludes that the Zongli Yamen ministers managed to negotiate enough power through means existing within the Qing structure to navigate successfully the changing needs of the dynasty until the international context changed once again.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, Political science, Change, China, Foreign relations, Political history, Power, Qing dynasty, Zongli Yamen",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

I argue that the Japanese postwar developmental state system has its roots in the crucial decisions about industrial structure made by the Japanese policymakers in Manchuria and wartime Japan in the context of preparing for a total war with the United States. The decisions made during the critical juncture continued to affect the evolutional process of Japan's economic system for several decades. It also aims at explaining the context behind the path dependent evolutional process of the Japanese developmental state system. I argue that there are two factors that induced reemergence of a developmental state system in postwar Japan. First, there was an important personal linkage among the governments of Manchuria, wartime Japan, and postwar Japan. Those bureaucrats who built developmental systems in Manchuria and wartime Japan continued to occupy important positions in the postwar Japanese government. Second, in addition to the personal linkage, there was an important linkage in the policymakers' idea during these periods. The wartime developmental state system reemerged in the postwar period, not just because the same individuals were in power, but because these individuals maintained the same ideational guidance during and after the war. This ideational continuity explains the reason why the postwar policymakers reproduced a developmental state system.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, Political science, China, Developmental state systems, Japan, Manchuria, Postwar, World War II",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

All of these changes were undertaken and managed by the provincial government, and none were particularly successful. Because of the political, military and financial power of the local elites, attempts to put local security forces under the control of the county manager only ended up giving official sanction to the diffuse elite-managed militia system in existence. Reconstruction work expanded the presence of the state through the establishment of reconstruction organs, but their work was ineffective except in some areas of traditional elite responsibility. Attempts to reform the land tax collection system met with the barriers of local resistance to land resurveying, of entrenched localism in land measurement and management, and were hampered by an approach which did not realistically assess the causes of existing rural problems, and which reflected an overwhelming concern for the strategic aspect of land reform as a measure to undermine the growing influence of the Chinese Communist Party rather than as a solution to outstanding rural social and economic concerns.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, Political science, China, state building",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
305106739,"Schneider, Helen M.",Keeping the nation's house: Domesticity and home economics education in Republican China,Contemporary,"This dissertation is an examination of home economics education in China during the Republican period (1911–1949). For the educated upper- and middle-class of this period, new ideas about management of domestic space became increasingly important in China's quest for acceptance as a modern nation. I examine intellectual interpretations and idealizations of domesticity using the prism of home economics education ( jiazheng jiaoyu ) and homemaking ( jiashi ) as expressed in the popular press, in educational institutions, and in social work. This exploration of shifting meanings of domesticity and women's roles in the home uncovers some basic processes of social change that have often been overlooked by historians of modern China. To what extent were practices of state formation normalized through changes in the home? Were Chinese women able to use changing notions of domesticity and home management to negotiate new roles and actions? My conclusion is that while there was some debate, educators generally agreed that the most important social role for women was carrying out their “natural” duties as mothers and wives. Education about the home was necessary to prepare them for these responsibilities. The discipline of home economics developed to meet this need. This study outlines the development of this field. first as educators made suggestions about the requirements for home economics, and then as the discipline developed in selected institutions of higher learning. The disciplinization of home economics is an illuminating example of how discourses about differences between women and men and their “natural” social roles were institutionalized. By looking at the instruction of home economics in colleges and teachers' schools through archival and published sources, this work explores the ways that the state was involved in the formation of new domestic orders. Home economics as a field prepared women to manage their own homes, but also for professional management activities such as social work. As members of the national elite, home economists worked to improve their own homes and the families of others in order to secure social order and ensure future development of the Chinese nation.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"History, Womens studies, China, Discipline, Domesticity, Family, Home economics education, Republican",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

It is both an intellectual history—to trace the changing and conflicting conceptualizations of female sexuality in both elite and popular discourses, and a social history—to look for the possible space and resources for women to negotiate autonomy over their sexual bodies and explore their desires.

304024026,"Wang, Tay-sheng",Legal reform in Taiwan under Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945): The reception of Western law,Contemporary,"From the standpoint of Taiwan's legal development, a key characteristic of Japanese colonial law was that it simultaneously introduced Western law to the island. This study thus focuses on the Taiwanese reception of Western law under Japanese rule. It demonstrates the extent to which Taiwanese legal concepts diverted from Chinese legal tradition to modern Western law during the fifty-year colonial period. In the late nineteenth century, Japan, with its experience of the Meiji legal reform, conquered Taiwan and began to modernize the law in Taiwanese society, a frontier settler society with a traditional Chinese legacy. Before 1922, only a few Japanese Westernized laws were enforced while Taiwanese customary law remained. However, after 1922, due to the colonial policy of the extension of mainland law, most Western-style Japanese laws were put into effect in Taiwan. Those Westernized laws in colonial legislation were effectively implemented by the modern judiciary in Taiwan and therefore gradually penetrated into Taiwanese society, although some colonial special institutions obstructed the spread of Western law. In criminal justice, Japanese colonialists established modern state authority by ruthless suppression of Taiwanese resistance, but also resolved the social disorder prevalent in Ch'ing Taiwan. During this process the general population had already been exposed to Western-style criminal institutions. These institutions were accepted because they represented state authority, not because they were presumed just. In Taiwanese civil justice, property law was largely transformed to modern Western law. however, status law was modified by Western legal ideas to a limited extent. Indeed the Japanese regime was a competent reformer in Taiwan's legal modernization. But the Taiwanese paid tremendous costs for the by-product of such Japanese-led legal reform. After Japan left Taiwan, the basic approach in this legal reform was maintained by the new-coming ROC regime, although the ROC officials brought in different methods of implementing the Western-style codes. In conclusion, the Japanese legal reform allowed Taiwanese people to become familiar with the form of many Western legal institutions. but the fundamental spirit of modern Western law in protecting people from an arbitrary government and realizing justice was not yet generally known.",1992,1992,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"Law, History, Political science, Social structure, China, colonialism",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States
2980000045,"He, Belinda Qian",Expose and Punish: Trial by Moving Images in Revolutionary China,Contemporary,"My dissertation traces a history of how class struggle was made of and through moving images in China. Whereas many existing studies concerning socialism and leftist cultural politics treat class struggle as a given fact, my dissertation draws back the curtain on how class struggle was constructed in China. Much emphasis has been put on either the violent components of Mao’s class war or Chinese class struggle as a project saturated with displays, performances, and spectacles. However, the intersection of class struggle as both spectacular violence and spectatorial violence remains largely underexplored. Through historicizing the merging of violence and spectacle within an overarching class-coded system, however, my dissertation suggests the mutual constitution of image making and justice, upon which the project of class struggle was legitimized, and in effect produced everyday violence. Drawing on archives, fieldwork, and an audiovisual corpus, the project examines the mass production of what I call looks of enmities—penal spectacles, incriminating media, hate images, antagonistic ideologies, and encounters of watching-as-judging. Overall, the project is a dual history of trial as media and media as trial. Concerning the complex interrelation between photographic media vis-à-vis socialist criminal justice and violence driven by a singular and overarching system of partitioning coded in the term class, my dissertation intends to challenge established boundaries within which both film/art-historical scholarship and legal historiographies are usually approached and disseminated. I address the following questions: Historically, how did (audio)visual media and trial/execution, whether legal or extralegal, intersect in China? How did moving images enact and, in turn, shape punishment and the politics of enemy-making in the age of class struggle? Theoretically, (how) is justice visible? How does an image shame or judge, and how does cinema punish? Methodologically, what is the role of the archive in history, historiography, and historical thinking? How do archival images live their own lives?",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,"Comparative Literature, Cinema and Media",Comparative Literature,"Moving images, Justice, Revolutionary China, Socialism, China, Leftist, Cultural politics, Violence throughout history,",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

An analysis on institutional transformation",Contemporary,"Corporate forms were widely recognized as business organizational forms that were used both to consolidate capital and to disperse the investment risk. The idea of organizing the economy through companies, first spread out among European countries and America, was later on also adopted by most societies that had developed a modern industrialized economy. This dissertation is an analysis of the emergence of corporate forms in China between the late 19 th century and before the establishment of the Communist China. I seek to provide an alternative explanation of the emergence of corporate forms in China. While I do not intend to neglect political and economic factors, this dissertation suggests that, besides these factors, there were more important social dimensions determining the transformation. The critical juncture that initiated the transformation of the Chinese economic institution was the strong presence of foreign capital in the mid-19 th century. This external factor became the significant cause of the eventual break down of the traditional mode of economic organization, and the replacement of it with the modern, Western, mode of organization. The path that took off from this juncture and developed into a ‘legacy,’ however, was constrained and shaped by the particular historical configuration in China during that time. I argue that, during the institutionalization of Western corporate forms in China, the Chinese merchants did not simply adopt the organizational forms and use them to engage in the modern economy. Rather, Chinese merchants, and later entrepreneurs, were using the joint-stock company as a way to bundle pre-existing social relations, traditional Chinese business practices, and the Western way of business organization into a more useful organizational format that allowed for the accumulation of capital. Company, as a form of business organization, was used by the Chinese entrepreneurs at the same time as a carrier of personal resources. The analysis offers a way to understand how continuity in Chinese social organization was maintained in the face of economic transformation, and shows how pre-existing social relationships were embedded in the adaptation of modern business rationality.",2004,2004,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"Social structure, History, Economic history, China, Corporate forms, Institutional transformation",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

Since the 17th century, the new immigrant society favored the growth of economic crops to exchange the necessary goods from mainland. This started the long process of dynamic interaction between the folk religion and the economic development of Taiwan. As a result, the original roles of the deities, Ma-tsu (a protector of seamen) and T'u-ti-kung (a protector of farmers) had changed and gradually emerged as commercial gods. The official culture did not root deeply in this new society, so the official temples without the local support, were doomed to decline. Under the Japanese rule, the Taiwanese were barred from government positions but active in economic field. Hence, the content of folk religion, articulating their life, became more concerned with material gains. Without the involvement of high-culture elites in shaping the beliefs, moral or abstract values were less emphasized in the religion. Although the religion is an important part of the cultural identity of the Taiwanese, there was no dramatic and violent confrontation between the folk religion and colonial rule. Only a few Taiwanese converted to the religions that the rulers promoted, although the folk religion adopted some new elements from the Japanese religions. Another important aspect of this study is that the study of Taiwanese folk religion can offer an alternative view to the Western general theory of religious study, which assumes that state and religion are independent institutions, and is unworkable for some religions such as Taiwanese folk religion. Data for the temples of this study mainly come from three sources: (1) Ch'ing Gazetteers (written from 1694 to 1898), (2) The Survey of Temples (six volumes) (conducted by the colonial government in 1915-1916), (3) Appendix: Directory of Temples in Taiwan, in Taiwanese Religion and Superstitious Customs (So, Keirai, 1938).",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Washington,NA,NA,"Social structure, Religion, History, Folklore, Cultural anthropology, China",37,Seattle,Oregon,47.6211,-122.3244,United States

Drawing on archival documents, government publications, medical writings, newspapers, memoirs, and oral history interviews, this research shows how the medical teams dispatched from Beijing and provincial capitals carried out anti-syphilis campaigns among the diverse minority communities on the Inner Asian frontiers of China. My research suggests that the Ethnic Health program embodied the PRC’s medicalized and sexualized approach to “seeing” and governing Mongols, Tibetans, Uyghurs, and other minority peoples in the peripheral regions. Ultimately, the dissertation argues that the early PRC state launched a biopolitical campaign to bolster regime legitimacy and, more importantly, incorporate Inner Asian minority groups into the emerging Han-centered socialist nation-state.

Chapter 1 discusses common assumptions of past studies of the texts. It identifies conventions of reading historical texts that circumscribe analytical approaches to their narratives. It then justifies a literary approach based on the work of several narrative theorists. Chapter 2 reviews past work on each text's compilation and suggests possible types of sources on which each was based. A case is made in practical terms that compilation of the narratives in the texts involved a creative process fundamentally similar to the composition of fiction. Chapter 3 treats three aspects of plot. Section one examines the extent to which a complex and disjointed series of events--those surrounding the Battle of Chengpu--are emplotted to form unified and coherent structures. Section two treats ways in which temporal and causal relationships between events functions to structure plot. Section three examines events whose existence is not essential to the chronological or causal structure in the narratives and how their inclusion imbues plot with meaning. The section focuses on accounts of ritual ceremony. Chapter 4 treats three aspects of character. Section one explores how characters placed in analogous situations function reciprocally to characterize one-another.

Wang Dang re-organized these anecdotes into fifty-two categories, of which thirty-five were inherited from the categories of the Shishuo xinyu (New Conversations of Tales of the World, ca. 438) and seventeen were additions from Wang. The Tang yulin is often regarded as a vital source primarily for the study of Tang history and literature, but its Song dynasty perspective on the historical and anecdotal representations of the past has not yet been sufficiently studied. This essay treats the Tang yulin as a Song scholar's effort to selectively recycle the fragmented records of the Tang, give these discontinuous narratives structure, and bestow meaning through such structure. The discussion here holds that the origins and transmission of these anecdotal memories of the past can be traced to the oral culture of ancient China and treats the literary tradition yu , conversations, as a bridge connecting this oral culture and the textual tradition that preserves and perpetuates such memories. This study approaches these anecdotal narratives from the perspective of cultural memory. With the Tang yulin as a case study, it aims to bring into focus both the role anecdotal literature plays as vehicle and repository of cultural memory, and the function anecdotal collections play in restructuring cultural memory. This study treats Wang Dang's selection and re-organization of these accounts as re-structuring Song dynasty cultural memory of the Tang and constructing his own image of the Tang. It concludes that the Tang yulin is a text shaped by the particular historical, social, cultural and intellectual circumstances of its own time, and reveals a Song perspective on the cultural memory of the Tang that was conditioned by and directed to the cultural and intellectual concerns at the heart of Song literati culture.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,Chinese,Chinese Language & Literature,"Asian literature, History, Asian Studies, Anecdotal literature, China, Cultural memory, Song dynasty, Tang dynasty, Tang yulin, Wang dang",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States

Like other celebrated periods, the Jin period has its own literary achievements and characteristic style. Moreover, it was creative era in the history of Chinese thought. At the same time, this period was extremely dangerous for members of the literati, and many of them lost their lives in the political chaos and social turbulence. Lu Yun (262–303) has always been much in the shadow of his more famous elder brother Lu Ji (262–303). Nonetheless, Lu Yun distinguished himself through his prolific tetrasyllabic ( siyan ) and pentasyllabic ( wuyan ) poetry, in particular in the subgenre of “presentation and reply poems” ( zengda shi ). Lu Yun also wrote rhapsodies ( fu ), engaging both in lyrical and political oriented expression. Prominent in the writings of Lu Yun is his realization of the suffering due to his separation from his brother and his family in southern China. His values of clarity, brevity, and the expression of emotions, all of which are based on “naturalness,” also illuminate a variant strain in the literature of the Jin period.

Taking the establishment of a new value system as the highest goal, Chou Tso-jen was occupied by two major concerns: the development of individuality and the social transformation for the fulfillment of the individualistic humane life, a life that synthesizes individuality, humanity and the orientalistic aesthetics. It was in this vein that Chou took part in the New Literature Movement and the New Thought Tide Movement. It was also in this vein that he maintained a preference for the Confucian concept of Li (norms and institutions) and the orientalistic spiritual life. This view accounts for both Chou's progressive and conservative appearance. Chapter I analyzes the familial, educational, intellectual and aesthetic background of Chou Tso-jen's thought. The combined impact of Chinese, Japanese and European cultures on Chou is also discussed. Chapter II discusses Chou's roles in the Anti Li-chiao and New Thought Tide Movements. As a member of the New Youth group, Chou added significantly to the group's promotion of science and democracy, yet at the same time maintained his own preference for Confucian ideals and an artistic life. Chapter III reviews the development of individualism in modern China. As individualistic concepts from Yen Fu to Hu Shih all emphasized sacrifice of the individual to the collective good, Chou's emphasis on man's naturalness and his effort to maintain a balance between individual and society had special meaning at that time. Chapter IV is a study of Chou's literary outlook. While Chou promoted individualistic literature during the New Literature Movement, he also emphasized literature's effectiveness in transforming the national spirit. Chapter V is devoted to Chou's cultural and political ideals, which were made clear in his enthusiasm for the New Village Movement. The failure of this movement ended Chou's utopianism and forced him to recontemplate China's spiritual and practical future.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"Asian literature, History, China",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States

Michael",The world of the mind in early medieval Sichuan: The life and works of Qiao Zhou,Ancient,"This study seeks to uncover the intellectual world of third-century Sichuan by focusing on the life and works of Qiao Zhou, a scholar-official of Shu Han. Qiao left important writings in the fields of classical studies and historiography. Unfortunately, his scholarship has been largely overlooked due to his involvement in political affairs. This dissertation seeks to re-evaluate Qiao Zhou and contextualize his work in the sphere of regional and national intellectual trends. Chapter 1 examines the family background and life of Qiao Zhou, with particular emphasis on his political activity. Chapter 2 establishes and analyzes Qiao's intellectual lineage, which began in the Western Han and extended forward one generation beyond Qiao Zhou. This chapter discusses the lives and works of various members of the line, and identifies the key elements of the lineage's intellectual traditions. Three chapters examine Qiao's writings in three distinct areas. Chapter 3 discusses Qiao's exegetical writings and prophesies. Here, he appears unremarkable, yet consistent with other scholarly approaches and concerns of the period. Chapter 4 illustrates Qiao Zhou's importance as an historian. In particular, his writings in the historical sub-genres of historical criticism and local history greatly influenced subsequent generations of Chinese historians. Chapter 5 examines the political writings and teachings of Qiao Zhou, showing a loyal and concerned Confucian official engaging with the political issues of his time. Finally, Chapter 6 investigates the lives and works of Qiao Zhou's descendents and students, seeking evidence of the continuation of Qiao's intellectual and political activities. Additionally, the chapter briefly surveys the manner in which later historians have viewed and portrayed Qiao's life and works.

304376740,"Ho, Shun-yee",Symbolism in the religious poems of the Book of Poetry,Ancient,"The goal of this research is to explore beliefs of the Zhou people by attempting to decode religious symbols in the Book of Poetry (c. 1100-600 BC). Symbols, pointing beyond themselves, are the best vehicles for the expression of religion, which contains both the character of concealment and of revelation. Broadly speaking, the sacred essence embodied in symbolism has often been a kind of cultural essence, because religion itself is a way to face life's challenges and religious norms influence people's behavior. Moreover, sacred symbols have formed a comprehensive network composed of countless objects and acts in people's daily lives. Thus whether from a spiritual or material dimension, religious symbolism is an effective key to disclosing man's ideas and emotions in the past. An analysis of the major symbols in the religious poems of the anthology reveals a spiritual utopia which is at once holy and secular. The Zhou, at the core of their religion, believed that the supreme Heaven, gracious and authoritative, granted blessings upon man and that the ancestral spirits kept protecting their offspring in the numinous world. On the one hand, the worshippers responded by establishing communication with the spirits, expressing man's sincere gratitude, and, in a mystical sense, seeking harmony from the divine. On the other hand, pious sacrificers expected practical rewards, especially wealth, prosperity, and longevity. Such wishes were only realized had worshippers pleased the divine by presenting rich offerings and by following Heaven's moral rules. The symbolic order was so simple, rational, and sacred that it was not sufficient to embrace sophisticated ontological quests, frenzied ritualistic practices, and sheer humanistic concerns--elements which might have been found in the symbolic worlds of other cultures and in belief systems not represented in the Shi jing. To conclude, in Zhou culture as embodied in the Book of Poetry, the secret to facing life, no matter how good or bad, was an ever-bright world dominated by an ultimate power.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Religion, History, China",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States

Chu religious practices in China: Divination, sacrifice, and healing in the newly excavated Baoshan manuscripts",Ancient,"This dissertation examines a set of bamboo slips discovered in a fourth century B.C.E. Chu tomb at Baoshan in China in 1987 that record multiple occasions throughout a three-year period (318 B.C.E.–316 B.C.E.) when Shao Tuo, identified as the tomb occupant, used divination and sacrifice to address anxieties about his illness. The manuscripts show an aspect of popular religious life that has been missing from the picture of fourth century B.C.E. China. The composite nature of the practice also directs our attention to debates about magic, science, and religion that date back to the time of E. B. Tylor and Sir James Frazer. After describing the Baoshan manuscripts, I will use them as a case study to reconstruct the practice and interrogate the categories that anthropologists and theorists in religious studies often use to describe early societies. Combining textual interpretation with phenomenological and comparative approaches, I argue for a more diverse picture of fourth century B.C.E. Chinese religions. The hybrid practice combining divination, sacrifice, and healing performs significant cultural, social, and psychological functions in the Baoshan context and argues against an evolutionary view that sequences early societies in an exclusive and hierarchical progression from magic, to religion, to science.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Religious history, History, Baoshan, China, Chu, Chu dynasty, Divination, Early Chinese religion, Fourth century B.C.E., Healing, Sacrifice",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States
304237124,"Lubkeman, Lynn Marie",Anna Louise Strong and the Stalinist era,Contemporary,"The dissertation is a political biography of the radical American writer Anna Louise Strong (1885-1970), focusing on her involvement in the Russian and Chinese Communist revolutions. The study examines Strong's writings and activities from the time of her political radicalization during the Seattle General Strike of 1919 until her death in Beijing in 1970. Attracted to the message of the Bolshevik Revolution, Strong sought a life in the Soviet Union beginning in 1921, becoming internationally prominent as an advocate of the Russian revolution at the same time as she unsuccessfully struggled to become an active participant in Soviet political life. Frustrated by the limitations of her role as a sympathetic outsider, she eventually expanded her reportorial career to one of roving to revolutions around the world. Strong first visited China in 1925, beginning a long association with the Chinese Communist movement. In 1946-47, she conducted a series of celebrated interviews with Chinese Communist leaders, including Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi, published as The Thought of Mao Tse-tung. The impact on the international Communist world was profound and resulted in Strong's expulsion from the Soviet Union in 1949, denounced by Stalin as an imperialist spy. Her exoneration after Stalin's death permitted her triumphant return to China in 1958, where she remained an honored guest of the Chinese government until her death. The study emphasizes the events leading to, and resulting from, the 1949 incident, which, it is argued, reveals the extent and the depth of tension between the Russian and Chinese Communists in the late 1940s, when the Chinese Revolution was on the verge of success. The study is also concerned with the political and psychological dilemmas of fellow travelers during the Stalinist era and the factors inhibiting political self-understanding. The dissertation is based on materials in Strong's own archives (located at the University of Washington and Beijing National Library), archives of Strong's close friends and political associates, interviews with Strong's surviving contemporaries, F.B.I. and other government files obtained through F.O.I.A., and the large body of Strong's published works.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"European history, History, American history, Journalism, Biographies, China, Russia, Strong, Anna Louise",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States
304253922,"Kung, Chi-Keung",Intellectuals and the masses: The case of Qu Qiubai,Contemporary,"This is a study of Qu Qiubai's intellectual transformation from 1915 through the May Fourth period (1919-1921), and his subsequent development of a concept of popular culture. Using those two aspects of Qu's life as focal points, the inquiry aims to shed light on how the modern Chinese intelligentsia of gentry origin responded to the foreign capitalist intrusion that undermined the old order, and what intellectual traits can be identified with this educated stratum in its relationship to the masses, mostly the peasants. As far as the intelligentsia was concerned, besides the imperatives of national survival, there were psychological dimensions to its alliance with the masses. While the milieu of 20th century China no longer supported gentry sensibilities, it lay bare the hypocrisy of gentry life. Hence the elites had a strong sense of guilt in the face of the masses. Moreover, severed from all traditional ties and alienated from the existing order, the intelligentsia often regarded the masses as a source of emotional and moral strength. The weakness of the bourgeoisie and other social classes, however, augmented the elites' traditional sense of mission, who regarded themselves as agents of social change. A strong voluntarism that militated against a faith in the people thus underlay the consciousness of the intelligentsia. As a contribution to closing the gap with the masses, Qu's concept of popular culture was marked by a strong anti-elitist orientation. But in calling upon intellectuals as cultural agents to help the culturally deprived masses, Qu's position on the problematic relationship between intellectuals and masses was ambivalent. The tensions between a desire to lead the masses, and a longing to merge with them in Qu's thought were characteristic of 19th century Russian Populism. Qu's populist faith can be attributed to the problems posed by Chinese society, which were not unlike those besetting 19th century Russian Populists. These problems included the existence of a large peasant mass, a relatively small intelligentsia, and a stifling political order in both societies. The populist strains in Qu's thought also can illuminate some of the problems involved in the adaptation of Marxism in China.",1995,1995,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"History, China, populism",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States

It examines the development of the industry from within the context of a strong, highly cultivated trade in American flour, which by the turn of the century dominated China's rapidly expanding domestic market. As the United States' second leading importer by volume of flour, China grew increasingly vital to west coast millers as an outlet for surplus flour production. Conversely, rising imports of American flour heightened nativist opposition to foreign economic aggrandizement and encouraged Chinese entrepreneurs to explore the feasibility of modern flour milling. This study examines economic factors affecting the various rivals in China's flour market--American imports, foreign mills operating in China, and native mills. It focuses on the ability of Chinese entrepreneurs to merge native raw materials and labor with advanced technology. small plot farming with economies of scale. village and kinship bonds with western management techniques. and traditional with modern business methods--producing a dynamic and highly effective hybrid industrial system. It also examines the development of the flour milling industry within a political context. It argues that the Qing's post-Boxer support of private industry under the rights recovery movement followed the most expedient policy for achieving national wealth and security. Convergence of Qing and industrialist objectives encouraged the formation of a synergistic state-capitalist relationship, which defined the contours of late imperial reforms, particularly as manifested in the 1905 anti-American boycott.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"History, Economic history, Agricultural economics, Business costs, China",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States

Despite the innate contradiction between nationalism and internationalism at its birth, the Comintern--in contrast to the Soviet state--was able to maintain a genuine sense of internationalism through the Second Congress of 1920 by fostering the hope of the imminence of world revolution. It was only with the Third Congress' abandonment of the idea of immediate world revolution in 1921 that the proletarian internationalism of the Comintern clearly began to fade. The influence of the Comintern on the communist movements in Shanghai began with the Second Congress. Pak Chin-sun, the leader of the Communist Party of Korea, and the Far Eastern Secretariat were the two agents of the Second Congress in the Far East. Unlike the Communist Party of Korea, which embodied the internationalist element of the Comintern, the Far Eastern Secretariat was essentially a Russian organ, composed exclusively of Russians, and pursuing Russian interests. Thus, the Far Eastern Secretariat's suppression of the Communist Party of Korea in 1921 signaled the triumph of Soviet interests and the suppression of the internationalism of the Comintern in the Far Eastern communist movement. The direct influence of the Comintern on the Chinese communist movement began only in June 1921, when the Korean Communist Party had been already destroyed by the Far Eastern Secretariat. Under the influence of the directives of the Third Congress, internationalism was divested of its anti-imperialist meaning in the Far Eastern revolutionary movements. Anti-imperialism, which originally had been conceived as part of the projected realization of proletarian internationalism in the East, now belonged to the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution. The Chinese communists finally accepted this separation of nationalism and internationalism in May 1922. Nationalism, not internationalism, was henceforth to be the driving spirit in East Asian communist movements.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"History, History, China, Korea",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States
304537602,"Yang, Fang-yen","Nation, people, anarchy: Liu Shih -p'ei and the crisis of order in modern China",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines Liu Shih-p'ei's (1884–1919) intellectual development in the context of the contemporary crisis of order. In doing so, I focus on two intellectual problematiques of enduring significance which began to emerge at around the turn of the twentieth century: (1)&#xa0.the problematique of nationalism in relation to universalism and to the Western model of sociohistorical development. and (2)&#xa0.the problematique of the social-political relationship between the intelligentsia and the masses. These problematiques unfolded in Liu's consciousness in the form of three sets of polarities: the polarity between nationalism and universalism, the love/hate polarity in his attitude to modern Western civilization, and the polarity between a populism and elitism in his attitude to the “people” ( min ). I argue that the tensions generated by these polarities constituted the conceptual dynamics behind the Protean pattern of Liu's development. (In 1903–1906, Liu was committed to (1)&#xa0.an ethnic nationalism which was imbued with the feelings of resentment to the West and hatred against the Manchus. and (2)&#xa0.a popular revolution which aimed to bring forth a democratic order in China. During his sojourn in Tokyo (1907–1908), Liu became an anarchist and advocated a “fundamental revolution” to end both the capitalist-imperialist order and the major human problems since the dawn of civilization. The final decade of Liu's life was cast in a conservative mold. Before 1911, Liu upheld a conservative, anti-capitalist utopianism which sought to bring back an ideal order located in the Chinese past. After 1911, Liu developed a mystical historicism to justify a wholesale restoration of the Confucian ritual-political order.) Furthermore, I argue that in seeking to lift China from its present plight to a position of dignity and prosperity, Liu was much more in need of an intellectual orientation than a motive to act in the present or a sense of hope for the future. This need is evident in the ideological fervor and vacillations Liu displayed in 1903–1909. It is also evident in Liu's life-long quest for an all-embracing vision of reality, a quest which in turn testifies to the fact that underlying China's social, political and cultural crises was an intellectual-spiritual crisis.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"History, History, Minority & ethnic groups, Sociology, Anarchy, China, Intellectuals, Liu Shih-p'ei, Nationalism",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States
304084963,"Jones, Diane Marie",A comparative study of the social visions of M. K. Gandhi and Mao Zedong,Contemporary,"A close examination of the thought of Mao and Gandhi reveals striking parallels, particularly in their social visions for China and India. These similarities are surprising in light of the fundamentally different philosophical assumptions of Mao and Gandhi. This dissertation seeks to examine the evolution and content of the Maoist and Gandhian social visions, analyzes the similarities between them and offers an hypothesis accounting for the existence of these similarities. Both Mao and Gandhi envisioned radically decentralized future societies, organized into semi-autonomous rural villages or communes. They both believed that the role of cities should be radically reduced and that rural communities should become centers of culture and learning. Also common to both social visions was the idea that all able-bodied citizens should participate in manual labor. Both Mao and Gandhi believed that manual labor was necessary not only as a matter of economic necessity, but also as a means of social levelling and moral purification. Both Mao and Gandhi were deeply concerned with education and believed that manual labor should be incorporated into it. They both maintained a suspicion of intellectuals and book learning and sought to establish systems of universal education which, by integrating intellectual and manual training, would overcome the social division between an educated elite and an unlettered laboring class. Similar historical circumstances in India and China in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries help to explain the parallels described above. This hypothesis is strengthened by comparison with a third example, the Russian populist ideology of the mid- and late nineteenth century. In all three cases, large agrarian societies were faced with the challenge of an expansive, industrializing, capitalist West. Intellectuals in all three societies sought to protect their own peasantry from the ravages of capitalist/industrialist development through social visions which would preserve the autonomy of rural life. All three sought to overcome the social gap between the intelligentsia and the peasantry by urging the former to go to the countryside, unite with and serve the people.",1993,1993,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"History, Social research, China, Gandhi, Mohandas K.@, India, populism",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States

But how did intellectual and political elites draw the Chinese people into this effort? In the early twentieth century, reformist intellectuals, nationalist politicians, and commercial publishers seized upon a long-standing narrative of the four great inventions of ancient China (si da faming 四大发明), which originated in sixteenth-century Europe, arguing that gunpowder, printing, paper, and the compass had changed the world. Popularizing this narrative not only provided an antecedent to China’s modernization, it also offered an inspiring vision of China’s becoming in the world. While many Chinese historians have focused on the great inventions as an example of the nationalist ideology that contributed to the establishment of the history of science in academia, fewer scholars have followed the great inventions narrative across domestic and global divides of knowledge production, where the inventions became evidence for both Westerners and Chinese supporting the logic of progress through science. I argue in this dissertation that the understanding of scientific progress and East-West relations have been intimately entwined since the beginning of the Enlightenment in the seventeenth century, and that it still serves as one of the most recognized motifs in discussions about China’s past, present, and future integrations with the contemporary world.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,History,History,"Modern China, Great inventions, Nationalism,",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States

This dissertation offers a gender analysis of why the colonial government instituted pro-women policies during Hong Kong's authoritarian transfer of rule (1982–1997), from British colony to a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and the differential impact this policy-making had on politically active women. Fieldwork included interviews, participant observation, and archival research. A multi-leveled, civil society-based analytical framework is developed to examine three case studies of pro-women policy-making: indigenous women's equal inheritance rights, anti-discrimination legislation, and grassroots women's political participation rights. Drawing from studies on gender, the state, and policy-making and debates on civil society in the contemporary PRC, the dissertation offers three theoretical propositions to explain the official adoption of women-related legislation and the outcomes of policy-making for women. The research suggests that the Hong Kong government's use of pro-women policies for larger political goals, the influence of organized women's mobilization on official pro-women policymaking, and the politicization of gender issues in local struggles backed by opposing versions of national identity are all factors that significantly shaped the relationship between transition and women in colonial Hong Kong. The dissertation builds on revisionist perspectives of state-society relations in Hong Kong, which challenge official claims of local political apathy and ideas about transient local democratization, but fail to consider gender politics. The dissertation contributes more generally to studies on civil society in the contemporary PRC by showing that further economic reform and political opening would serve the Beijing leadership's goals of unity and stability better than harsher authoritarian solutions.

The dissertation attempts to explain how British naturalists in China and their Chinese “associates” explored, studied, and represented China's natural world within the social and cultural context of late Qing China. At one level, it seeks to reconstruct and describe the purpose, process, results, and institutional base of the naturalists' research in a China that was beginning to come to grips with Western powers. I examine the boundary drawing and power negotiations among different groups involved in the activities. At another level the dissertation tries to trace and tease out the strands of knowledge traditions that converged in the scientific representations of the natural history of China. It unfolds the interplay between the discourse of natural history and that of practical knowledge (e.g. horticulture), Chinese export art, Chinese folk knowledge, and sinology. My ultimate goal is to explain the formation of scientific practice and knowledge in cultural borderlands during a critical period of Sino-Western relations. The first part of the dissertation discusses the research of British naturalists in Canton, the only Chinese port open to Western maritime trade between 1757 and 1842. I argue that the context of the China trade is crucial to our understanding of British investigations into China's natural world.

At the center of the various efforts by Chinese reformers and Western missionaries to renew or transform China was women's health, and both sides imposed Western standards of health upon Chinese women. Western medicine, as a form of Western learning, was thought to be a means by which to save Chinese women from their physical suffering, and medical missionary women were at the fore of the practical endeavors to better Chinese women's lives through Western medicine. This dissertation focuses on the encounter between Western medicine and Chinese society as it manifested itself at several levels in the interactions between American medical missionary women and their Chinese women patients, students, converts, and neighbors. What brought American medical missionary women to China was a combination of personal aspiration, cross-cultural gender politics, the unequal exchange between China and the West, and their marginal status at home. They positioned themselves as agents of progress bringing science and rationality to China. What many Chinese commoners perceived, however, was rather different—foreign missionaries were those who possessed magical powers that could be applied toward evil or beneficial ends. Locally, Western medical practice was often shaped by Chinese customs, which were infused with gender and body politics. Nationally, the contest of civilization helped give rise to China's “new women,” as exemplified by the lives of a number of Chinese Christian women doctors, well-educated and not burdened by so-called barbaric customs such as footbinding. Globally, the bound foot, as a collectible object, was medicalized and traveled across borders from the field to several metropoles, which quickened the hearts of future missionaries and intensified the sense of urgency about China's rehabilitation that many self-conscious—and antifootbinding—Chinese reformers felt. This study explores the global bound foot, body mutilation rumors hostile to foreigners, the gender and body politics of the American-Chinese medical/magical encounter, and the lives of American medical missionary women and Chinese Christian women doctors.",2003,2003,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Madison,NA,NA,"Science history, History, China, Gender, Missionary medicine, Women",18,Madison,Wisconsin,43.0822,-89.393,United States

Specifically, the research is comprised of three aspects. First, what were the social and technological conditions of emergence of these gazetteers and gazetteer maps? Second, how did political power influence the production process of the gazetteers and gazetteer maps? Finally, what were the cultural meanings which were reproduced, communicated, and experienced through the map images? The methodology which is derived from relevant cultural theories examines both maps and map making under their specific cultural context. Besides some basic techniques of analyses, such as cartographic analysis, the method of iconographical analysis is used to search for the symbolic meaning of the maps. In addition, a Geographical Information System is creatively applied to analyze the absolute accuracy and relative accuracy of one early map. The results of this research show that the strong social need, the influence of Neo-Confucianism, and progress of printing and paper making technologies were the main reasons for the rapid development of the gazetteers and their maps during the Song period. The political power controlled the process of compiling most gazetteers and maps. These maps presented various spatial images which were related to a state administrative division. Some important social concepts and relations, such as the emperor's power, were emphasized on the map images. Some aspects of general Chinese cartographic culture, such as multiple modes of representation, were also reflected on these maps. The studies in this dissertation also reveal the important nature of cartography and maps in general. Cartography is not only a technique of making maps but also a social practice. Maps can be looked upon both as the usual geographical representations of the spatial world and as the cultural images which reflect the societies in which they are produced. From this point of view, interpretation of maps can go beyond their cartographic technology and explore the social and cultural significance in their specific historical contexts.",1994,1994,Ph.D.,United States,University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee,NA,NA,"Geography, History, Science history, China",1,Milwaukee,Wisconsin,43.0642,-87.9675,United States

This dissertation argues that missionaries of the Christian Reformed Church went to China because they believed they had many points of contact with the Chinese. but their cultural and theological predispositions, combined with their inexperience and unrealistic expectations, initially caused the CRC missionaries to clash with Chinese culture. Through a process of conflict and negotiation, however, the missionaries and Chinese discovered one fundamental point of contact: the Reformed tradition's concept of covenant theology, with its emphasis on community, created a bridge to the Confucian culture and worldview of the Chinese as well as to the social needs of some of Rugao's citizens in the exigencies of that time. In focusing on the mission's daily activities, the dissertation provides insight into the crucial partnership formed between missionaries and their Chinese partners needed for establishing a church, and it looks at how both sides were changed by working together. By exploring the evangelistic activities and the process of becoming a church member in Rugao, it increases our understanding of the process of translating the Christian faith across cultures. For example, though the missionaries maintained their theological commitments, they developed sympathies for Chinese culture and the Christians with whom they worked. and while the Christians in Rugao developed loyalty to the missionaries and the church, they adapted the faith the missionaries brought.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,Vanderbilt University,NA,NA,"Religious congregations, Religious history, History, China, Christianity, Cross-cultural contact, Mission, Rugao",2,Nashville,Tennessee,36.1715,-86.7842,United States

This region in eastern Manchuria lies within China’s present-day borders, but historically had never truly been a Chinese territory. Since the early twentieth century, Korean migrants transformed themselves from a settler community into an economically flourishing and politically autonomous enclave. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Chinese Communist Party successfully incorporated Yanbian into the Chinese polity for the first time through rhetorical power of Maoism and policies of socialist modernization that included both Han and Koreans. Their fortunes were reversed, however, during the Great Leap Forward (1958–1960) and the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), when radical Maoist interpretations of “class unity” made their Korean-ness itself a form of “sabotage” against communism.

1640769296,"Wu, Yinghui","Commentary, Illustration, and Cross-Generic Writing in Paired Editions of Xixiang ji and Pipa ji",Modern,"This study examines the reproduction and consumption of popular plays Xixiang ji (The Story of the Western Wing) and Pipa ji (The Lute) as a related pair in seventeenth-century China. During this period, a thriving economy and rapid urbanization stimulated the expansion of commercial publishing. A book market flourished with a bewildering variety of texts and pictures and inventive regroupings of existing materials. Seventeenth-century China has long been recognized as an age of individual creativity, with the elite literati as primary agents, but this study revises the picture by directing attention to the appropriation and transformation of the cultural ideal of creativity through the manufacturing and marketing of cultural objects, books in particular. The pairing and repackaging of old plays discussed in this study point to shifting notions of creativity that were driven by competition among book producers, that took shape in the interactive networks of publishers, commentators, and illustrators, and that imparted a sense of freshness and up-to-date appeal via imitation and ingenious recycling. Despite the common assumption that new works of drama such as The Peony Pavilion embodies the creativity of the late Ming, my study shows that the comparative ranking of a pair of old plays, Xixiang ji and Pipa ji, was at the core of the literati discourse on creativity and key to their claims to cultural authority. I study book producers' innovations to reframe Xixiang ji and Pipa ji in paired editions, a topic rarely touched upon by previous studies. The books discussed in this dissertation include five paired editions of Xixiang ji and Pipa ji that create different interrelationships between commentary, play text, and illustration, two correlated Books of Genius, and playful eight-legged essays on Xixiang ji and Pipa ji. These texts help us rethink creativity in the context of printing in which the boundaries between creation and imitation are deliberately blurred, the idea of newness contingent upon reading abilities, the books a hybridized mix that stimulates multiple, conflicting and occasionally far-flung interpretations. The discussion treats the new imprints of old plays as sites where the creative potentials of literati connoisseurs, commercial publishers, commentators and painters from the locally famous to the obscure converged and competed to influence the reading process. Paired editions of Xixiang ji and Pipa ji offer a unique perspective on the impact of woodblock printing on Chinese cultural life. When I point out the editions' links to other genres of printing and to poetry, painting, and calligraphy, I emphasize skills of intertextual, cross-generic, and cross-media imagination that would have been an indispensable part of culture in late imperial China, namely, the sensitivity to permeable boundaries of arts and genres. The recognition of multiple creativities in the historical context of seventeen-century China complicates the division of elite and popular culture. While the elites constantly redefined their aesthetic norms against aspirants for privileged social and cultural statuses, in the processes their membership already underwent profound change. The influx of creative energies from different social groups practically rewrote the terms of cultural excellence and redrew social boundaries.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Washington University in St. Louis,Chinese and Comparative Literature,Chinese Language & Literature,"Asian literature, Asian History, Asian Studies, Appropriation, Commentary, Creativity, Cross-media, Illustration, Woodblock printing",7,St. Louis,Missouri,38.6359,-90.2451,United States
1619650678,"Xu, Yunjing",Seeking Redemption and Sanctity: Seventeenth-Century Chinese Christian Literati and their Self-Writing,Contemporary,"Although the history of China's contact with Christianity can be traced back much further, it is the third wave of contact initiated by the Jesuit missionaries in the second half of the sixteenth century that developed into a multi-faceted communication and interaction between the Catholic side of Europe and the late imperial China. As many scholars have demonstrated, the histories of both sides of the Euro-Asia continent were affected in many aspects by this religious, cultural and political contact which lasted for over two centuries. Within this field, the study of educated Chinese Christians have gained momentum especially since the paradigm shift in the late 1970s from a mainly missiological and Eurocentric to a Sinological and Sinocentric approach. On the other hand, we still know more about a few high-profile Christians' public performance than we do about the private selves of educated Chinese Christians across social strata, and we still know more about how they were represented than how they represented themselves. It is my belief that a more thorough paradigm shift would necessarily result in more studies that portray Chinese Christians as exercising far greater agency than is generally acknowledged. This dissertation, by focusing on the self-writing of three seventeenth-century Chinese Christian literati—Wang Zheng (1571-1644), Zhang Shi (1605-1623) and Wu Li (1632-1718)—seeks to situate these men in their own cultural background and individual lives, in order to better understand their often complex and complicated engagement with their new religious faith. It explains how these three literati, by making use of a variety of literary genres and writing strategies, were able to use their writing as an instrument with which to both explore and express the deeper religious and spiritual significance of their adopted Christian faith in their personal lives. The diversity of their experiences and self-perceptions points to the divergent processes of religious conversion and personal identity formation. Together, they offer illuminating examples of how the meaning of being Christian in the seventeenth-century China was negotiated. Part One (Chapters One and Two) of this dissertation is devoted to Wang Zheng, a late Ming scholar-official who found particular strength and inspiration in a series of Desert Father stories, which is discussed in Chapter One. Serving as the co-translator, editor, prefacer, commentator and publisher of these texts, Wang Zheng establishes his own authorial persona as a scholar-penitent, and carves out a textual space to tell his own life-story together with those of the Western saints. By including his own story alongside the translated primary texts, Wang Zheng is able to publically give voice to his personal dilemma, which involved finding ways to reconcile his social and familial obligations as a Confucian scholar-official with his personal faith in the Christian God and desire for salvation. Chapter Two deals with a series of qu (non-dramatic lyric) poems Wang Zheng wrote, in which he explores the aesthetics of reclusion through an amalgamation of different reclusive personae including the Confucian sage, the Daoist free-roamer, the Chan Buddhist master and the Early Christian Desert Father. His failure to create a consistent persona of a Chinese Christian recluse reflects the ultimately incompatible notions of transcendence behind these different recluse ideals. Nevertheless, a close reading of these poems sheds light on the difficulties encountered by Wang Zheng as he struggled to shape a new literary identity for himself as Christian literatus and author. In Part Two (Chapters Three and Four), I turn to Zhang Shi, a Chinese Christian who, embracing the autobiographical trends of the time, was more audacious both in terms of his self-indictment and his self-celebration as a Christian. Zhang, a young man from a gentry family in Fujian province, constructed his authorial persona as a sinful slave who was granted a vision that not only healed him of his illness and converted him to Christianity, but also served to confirm his life mission as a special messenger from God. In his writings, Zhang Shi often breaks away quite radically from traditional Confucian social norms in order to seek personal redemption and sanctity. This radical stance, together with his accounts of visions and his interpretations of the divine messages conveyed to him during these visions, attracted many admirers and followers, especially after his premature death at the age of only 19 sui. There is a complete extant biography of this young man, which together with accounts of other people's dreams about him, offers us a rare opportunity to understand not only Zhang's construction of his own religious self-image, but also the reception and subsequent modification of this image by others after his death. Finally, in Part Three (Chapter Five), I turn to the more well-known Chinese Christian, Wu Li, the famous painter, poet and recluse who was also one of the first ordained Chinese Jesuit priests. My focus here is on Wu Li's Christian poetry, a topic that I also look at in Chapter Two in relation to Wang Zheng. I argue that Wu Li, living as he did in the unique political atmosphere of the post-Qing-conquest Jiangnan and enjoying an unprecedented access not only to a Jesuit education but to the priesthood itself, was able to resolve some of the conflicts Wang Zheng grappled with and successfully create a poetic voice of a Chinese Jesuit priest using traditional shi poetry. In the epilogue, I narrate briefly the reason why the voices of these seventeenth century Chinese Christians were smothered in the following two centuries, and how they were rediscovered by the first generation of Western-educated modern Chinese church leaders in the early twentieth century.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Washington University in St. Louis,Chinese Language and Literature,Chinese Language & Literature,"Asian literature, Religious history, Asian History, Chinese christians, Jesuit missionaries, Literati, Seventeenth century",7,St. Louis,Missouri,38.6359,-90.2451,United States
2280000000,"Chen, Gilbert Zhe ",Living in This World: A Social History of Buddhist Monks and Nuns in Nineteenth-Century Western China,Contemporary,"This dissertation relies on about 600 legal cases from the Ba County Archive that survive from the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century to investigate the social life of ordinary Buddhist monks and nuns. Although they played a crucial in maintaining the survival and proper functioning of Buddhism at the local level, they have remained significantly understudied. This dissertation adopts a bottom-up approach to investigate ordinary monastics’ involvement in various socioeconomic activities. By shifting the analytical focus from elite monks to their more mundane counterparts, this study illuminates how deeply ordinary monastics were embedded in their communities. The shift also broadens our understanding of clerics as more than liturgical specialists and appreciates the multiple roles played by them in their everyday interaction with community members. Instead of ascribing to the dominant view of lower-class clerics as marginalized in late imperial China, this work argues that they played a vital role in a migrant society like Qing Ba County. In order to demonstrate the complexity of ordinary monastics’ social embeddedness and take advantage of the rich archival materials, the present work has been organized around four thematic arteries. Chapter One analyzes the continued interaction between local monastics and their natal family members in a wide array of arenas, emotionally, socially, and economically. Instead of being antithetical to each other, the monastic and family regimes worked together to achieve mutual survival and reproduction. Chapter Two enlarges on the importance of Buddhist temples in the economic sphere. It reveals how temples per se evolved into a valuable commodity frequently bought and sold among monastics, pointing to a high degree of the commodification of Buddhism in local society. It goes on to analyze two major sources of land-generated income, one deriving from the agricultural tenancy and the other the lease of coal mountains. Both categories of income not only stabilized the economic foundation of local temples, but also undergirded the powerful positions of monastics in rural areas. The following two chapters concentrate on clerical sexual activities, one of the most notorious issues of Chinese Buddhism. Instead of interpreting them as signs of the decline of monastic discipline and the corruption of the lower-class clergy, this dissertation contextualizes these activities by revealing various socioeconomic factors contributing to their occurrence and unveiling local residents’ attitudes toward sexually misbehaving monks and nuns. Chapter Three argues that three factors facilitated the occurrence of clerical sexual affairs and conditioned the local community’s tacit tolerance of such affairs, that is, the monk’s social embeddedness, the continued monastic-familial interaction, and the monk’s economic strength. Taken together, local monks and their lay community members redefined normative clerical behavior on their own terms. The last chapter turns attention to nuns’ involvement in sexual activities, and foregrounds that gender was constitutive of female monastics’ experience of sexuality. Nuns were not only more vulnerable than monks to see their sexual affairs exposed to the public, they also suffered from gender-biased anticlerical rhetoric. Nevertheless, we should notice that nuns sometimes employed the discourse of female vulnerability to enlist more lenient treatment from the magistrate. Together, this dissertation provides a vivid picture of the discordant and disjointed side of Chinese Buddhism and foregrounds the importance of sociality in the lives of ordinary monks and nuns in local society. By doing so, we gain a more balanced and nuanced understanding of Chinese Buddhism and Chinese society.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Washington University in St. Louis,History,History,"Buddhism, China, Clergy, Economy, Family, Sex,",7,St. Louis,Missouri,38.6359,-90.2451,United States
2580000037,"Chen, Fanghao ",Touring the Nation: Domestic Tourism and Travel Culture in Modern China (1911-1942),Contemporary,"In the modern history of human mobility and movement, modern Chinese people’s domestic and international travel experiences have helped to open the eyes and minds in reconstructing and reshaping modern Chinese people’s geographical and socio-cultural concepts of the nation and the world. Rather than treating travel as merely a part of human activity of moving around or a form of leisure-seeking and entertainment, this study reveals the political and cultural significance of domestic travel that unfolds into four aspects: the multifaceted role of the very first modern Chinese tourism magazine China Traveler, the rising importance of children’s travel education, the use of travel accounts during the wartime, and popularization of regional cultures through railway travel writings. Modern Chinese tourism and travel culture can be examined in the theoretical framework of the (re)production, comprehension, and dissemination of knowledge, the discovery of modern Chinese children and consideration of their constructive roles in the society, and the experimental nature of modern Chinese travel writings. I reveal how the promotion, organization, regulation, and recollection of travel have been carried out by publishers, educators, politicians, writers, and college students. This dissertation demonstrates how Chinese people from all walks of life, in both rural and urban areas, have participated in modern Chinese domestic travel history. In doing so, this study aims to examine the practices and politics of modern Chinese tourism and travel culture from the late Qing to Republican China, and highlights how travel can be more than just being informative and relaxing but can also contribute to identity formation, children’s cultivation, and extending people’s geographical imagination.

Despite facing a precarious situation at the outset, including a shortage of foreign exchange, the threat of invasion by the People's Republic of China, and with few allies, the Nationalists oversaw the creation of what today is one of the Pacific's most stable governments and its second most powerful economy. At the heart of Taiwan's so-called economic miracle was a set of import-export policies which promoted a reduction in foreign exchange spending and an increase of export earnings through the expansion of the private industrial sector. The government took the lead in devising import-export policy, placing specific decision making power during the first eight years of recovery in the hands of a highly centralized, authoritative body, the Economic Stabilization Board (ESB). Chosen to staff the ESB was a small, select group of Nationalist techno-bureaucrats and US economic specialists who crafted the economic policies that returned Taiwan from the brink of collapse and put it on the road to economic growth. Together they oversaw what may well become known as the most productive period in the history of Sino-American relations and the most successful and sustained example of Sino-foreign cooperation. This dissertation examines the development of Taiwan's import-export policy from 1950, the year US aid appropriations to the Nationalists were resumed following a two-year lapse, to 1965, when US economic assistance was terminated, and the role of Nationalist and American economic personnel in import-export policy formulation.

Focusing on the relation between military technology, politics, and fiscal administration, it closely traces the change of the Ming state in association with the gunpowder revolution. Two aspects of institutional change receive special attention. The first aspect is the formation of an absolute authority in the Ming period, a development exhibiting many parallels with the absolute monarchies of other major gunpowder states in Europe and the Islamic world. The second is the modification of the Confucian bureaucratic government. The revolutions in gunpowder technology had a complex impact on the state bureaucracy in China. On one hand, the rise of absolute power in the early Ming period undermined Confucian central bureaucratic tradition, leading to frequent conflicts in court politics as well as divisions in state finance. On the other hand, the changes in the methods of warfare provided a new opportunity for civil officials especially provincial governors to participate in state military affairs. Paradoxically, the middle Ming period witnessed the expansion of the Confucian bureaucracy in the administration of military and frontier affairs. The Ming’s establishment of civil dominance over the military, a common feature of modern states, stood at odds with other gunpowder states which were primarily dominated by the military. Analysis of the two aspects together will offer insights into a new paradigm of the state formation of China in the gunpowder age.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Washington University in St. Louis,History,History,"Social sciences, Confucian bureaucracy, Early modern, Empire, Gunpowder politics, State, The military revolution,",7,St. Louis,Missouri,38.6359,-90.2451,United States
2320000000,"Zhang, Sijing ",Little Stars: Concubines and Literati Culture in Late Imperial China,Modern,"This dissertation studies the representation and self-presentation of concubines in literati households in late imperial China, with a focus on their interrelations with the cultural and intellectual trends during that period, such as the rise of the talented women’s culture, the identity crises of male literati, and the transformations of marital modes and gender norms. By offering contextualized analyses of a number of concubines’ biographies, anecdotes, and tales authored by men of letters, I explore how the male construction of the concubine’s image fitted into male literati’s self-identification and communal building projects. I also study how the cultural tradition of the scholar-concubine romance in previous times came to affect late-imperial scholars’ contemplation of their relationships with their concubines, and how literati writings on concubines in the early Qing were received and adapted by scholars of later generations as a means to connect with their literati-predecessors and consolidate a sense of community. By gender and social status, concubines were double-marginalized and have commonly been regarded as a group deprived of agency and subjectivity in modern times. My study argues against this stereotypical notion. Although concubines’ life experiences and mentalities were largely influenced by the (male) ideologies and sentiments of their times, and their literary vocations often dependent on the support of the male and female elites in their families, they managed to exert a degree of autonomy and, in some cases, choose the lives that they desired. My close reading of a small but illustrative selection of poems attributed to concubine authors also shows that literary talent might enable them to transcend class boundaries and receive a considerable amount of affection and respect from the elite members in their families. However, it could, sometimes, lead to their husband-masters’ feelings of insecurity and harm their marriage.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Washington University in St. Louis,Chinese Language & Literature,Chinese Language & Literature,"Social status, Qing Dynasty, Manshu, Zhang,",7,St. Louis,Missouri,38.6359,-90.2451,United States

It has served as the lasting bond of the two countries, enduring but often turbulent relationship. This dissertation is a study of the development of United States scientific relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) from 1949 to 1989. Science was a key element in America's historical “special relationship” with China. The rich tradition of Sino-American scientific cooperation dated back to the 1840s. From the establishment of the PRC in 1949 to the Sino-American rapprochement in 1972, despite inactivity in scientific discourse between the two countries as a result of the Cold War, strong underlying American influence in the development of Chinese science persisted. Traditional Sino-American scientific relations were steadily revived in the form of “scientific tourism” in the 1970s. The extension of full diplomatic recognition in 1979 unleashed a decade of broad Sino-American cooperation in science. The growth of scientific exchanges from 1979 to 1989 was more substantial than in any past historical period, and surpassed similar exchanges between other countries in the world. It was a distinctive “decade of science” in the history of Sino-American bilateral relations. The Tiananmen Square incident in 1989 and America's strong reaction to it, however, dampened the rapid expansion of the two nations's scientific relations. Though historical inquiries into Sino-American relations have been extensive on both sides of the Pacific, and the study of science in this relationship has received increased attention, a general study of Sino-American scientific relations is still lacking. Authors often underestimate the enduring impact of American science on modern China, or fail to acknowledge science as a lasting bond in Sino-American relations. Based on archival and library resources both in the United States and China and surveys and personal interviews, my dissertation provides a comprehensive examination of the development of U.S.-China scientific relations from 1949 to 1989, documenting the profound American influence in Chinese science. It combines a general chronological survey with topical analysis and case studies. The purpose of my dissertation is to show the continuity of American influence in Chinese science during the period of separation from 1949 to 1971, as well as the tremendous progress in Sino-American scientific relations that has benefitted both countries since 1972.

89216181,"Park, Hyunhee",The delineation of a coastline: The growth of mutual geographic knowledge in China and the Islamic world from 750 to 1500,Modern,"Most histories of contact between different societies and cultures begin in 1492 when Columbus first set foot in the Americas. This study, in contrast, aims to challenge such Eurocentric approaches to world history. It examines the long period of contact and exchange from 750 to 1500 between two of the most advanced societies in the world at the time: China and the Islamic world. These interactions suggest an alternate model for inter-cultural exchange quite different from the pattern of European colonization, namely, exchange between two societies at roughly equal levels of development. Between 750 and 1500, sources from both societies reveal that the regular exchange of commodities, technology, and travelers contributed to an increase in mutual knowledge. This study traces the extent of geographic knowledge and coastlines reflected in written and visual sources by analyzing original Chinese and Arabic texts—the most important sources being geographic accounts and maps. Scholars and geographers in the two societies wrote sophisticated accounts about each other during this extended period of contact. Many of these accounts—in different genres such as travel accounts and merchant handbooks—contain information about trade goods, local products, inventions, and sailing routes. Chinese and Islamic maps that depict Afro-Eurasia allow us to trace the increase in commercial and scholarly contacts between the two societies. These maps differ from European maps that were often produced as part of a state project to conquer new territory. People in China and the Islamic world did not know anything about each other in 750, when this study begins. Yet from that time on, scholars, sailors, and merchants in these two parts of the world gradually learned about each other, most rapidly in the many exchanges of the Mongol era (1260-1368). By 1500, Islamic geographers and Chinese geographers visualized their two societies as connected by a coastline linking the Islamic world with China, along which Chinese and Muslim navigators had been sailing since 750. As George Hourani noted half a century ago, the route from Canton (Guangzhou) to the Persian Gulf was the most heavily traveled sea route in regular use before 1492. After Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1498, he hired a Muslim navigator from Gujarat who knew exactly where to go on this well-known waterway.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"African history, History, Middle Eastern history, Geography, History, Ancient maps, China, Coastline, Contact, Geographic accounts, Geographic knowledge, Islamic world, The Islamic world, The Mongol Era",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304782510,"Cunnar, Geoffrey Eugene","The production and use of stone tools at the Longshan period site of Liangchengzhen, China",Ancient,"This dissertation focuses on the role of technology, specifically the production and use of stone tools, in one of the first complex societies in China, the Longshan (ca. 2600-1900 BC). The Longshan period of Late Neolithic China existed just prior to the rise of the Xia and Shang Dynasties and, as such, is a crucial period relevant to the understanding of the rise of complex society. Specialized production of ceramics, jade and other wealth items, along with the appearance of walled towns, proto-writing and incipient bronze metallurgy, are seen as hallmarks of the period. Research on ground and polished stone objects has been biased towards those tools of fine craftsmanship, such as jade yue battle axes and other stone items thought to represent prestige goods. This dissertation concerns itself mainly with utilitarian tools and the domestic economy. It addresses the analysis of 2,557 ground and polished stone tools and 2,043 chipped stone tools and associated debris that were excavated from the large Longshan town of Liangchengzhen in southeastern Shandong province. I focus on two major aspects of emerging civilization within the context of late Neolithic China at the site of Liangchengzhen: (1)&#xa0.defining the nature of production and use of primarily utilitarian stone tool forms, and (2)&#xa0.the application and advancement of ethnoarchaeological, technological and use-wear studies to ground stone tools. Through these analytical methods I am able to describe the organization of utilitarian stone tool production at Liangchengzhen. I argue that the production and use of the utilitarian stone tools was largely autonomous of direct elite involvement. I further argue that the production of certain tool types, like projectile points and the yue battle axe, were highly symbolic artifacts even for the non-elite members of society. As the result of the comprehensive use-wear studies, replication of tools, and spatial and technological analyses, I demonstrate that the non-elite members of the neighborhood that was excavated were engaged in part-time specialization of certain tool types.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"Archaeology, History, Ancient civilizations, China, Liangchengzhen, Longshan period, Neolithic, Stone tools",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
305387083,"Lai, Yu-chih","Surreptitious appropriation: Ren Bonian (1840–1850) and Japanese culture in Shanghai, 1842–1895",Contemporary,"This dissertation investigates a crucial but previously unexplored facet of visual culture in Shanghai: the increasing presence of Japanese goods, prints, and entertainment in Shanghai in the late nineteenth century. By constructing the daily circulation and consumption of Japanese material culture in Shanghai, this dissertation will argue that Ren Bonian, arguably the most creative and representative painter of Shanghai at the time, adopted and appropriated many designs and conventions from Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock prints and lacquer designs, but without giving explicit credit. In contrast to the supposed mainstream of Chinese-centered mentality in the Shanghai art scene at this time, ironically, it is indeed this unrecognized and somewhat surreptitious appropriation of artistic idioms from Japanese popular culture by painters like Ren Bonian that shaped what we now identify as the most inventive element of Shanghai paintings. In terms of the structure, this dissertation begins with a methodological discussion of the various issues regarding the significance of the period from 1842 to 1895, and of the artist, Ren Bonian, in the study of not only Chinese art history, but also cultural exchange and Sino-Japanese history. Due to the deeply rooted misconception that has always asserted a unilateral Chinese influence over Japan, Chapter One first “rewrites” a history of how Japanese luxury goods, including art objects, were indeed circulated, consumed, and appreciated in China throughout history. Coming back to Ren Bonian and Shanghai, in Chapter Two and Chapter Three, I reconstruct the Japanese things and Japanese people that Ren might have encountered and associated with, respectively, in his day in Shanghai. Then, Chapter Four is devoted to a formal investigation of Japanese idioms in the art of Ren Bonian. This visual analysis will finally come together with pieces of cultural fragments gathered in the previous chapters to form a picture of the emerging trans-national popular culture in Shanghai in the nascent modern world of the late nineteenth century.",2005,2005,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"Art history, History, China, Culture, Japanese, Ren Bonian, Shanghai",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States

By addressing issues of image-making, imperial patronage, regionalism, and religious practice, this study shows how these Daoist images shed light on painting practices and ritual performances in twelfth- and thirteenth-century China. The various chapters of this dissertation propose a sequence for studying the Boston triptych: from the opening stage of its production to when it was finished and used in a ritual context. The quality of the Boston triptych links the three paintings to a small body of extant works previously attributed to earlier painters or simply treated as anonymous works. Together, they belong to the little-studied Southern Song imperial collection and workshop production. Stylistic analysis of the Boston triptych and comparison with figure, landscape, bird-and-flower paintings, and Buddhist prints from the metropolitan Hangzhou region and the provincial Ningbo region suggests that it can be dated to the late twelfth to early thirteenth century. The Boston triptych is a powerful visual statement that documents the intricate intersection of image-making and religious practice. Its encyclopedic array of the deities of Heaven, Earth, and Water ( tianguan, diguan, shuiguan ), spirits, and a human ghost suggests that it was a set of efficacious images ( ling xiang ) used in a Daoist mortuary ritual huangluzhai , similar to a Buddhist shuilu hui . Both the Daoist canon and ethnographic sources have shown that paintings like the Boston triptych were hung alongside other painted deities in Daoist rituals, the common repertoire of which included sending petitions to the gods, summoning them to a ritual, warding off evil spirits, and exorcising human souls. The Boston triptych should be considered in such a performative setting. Its positioning in ritual and its style signify the efficacious presence of the mobile cosmic powers summoned by the Daoist practitioners to restore the universe to a natural order governed by the Dao.",2002,2002,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"Art History, History, Religious history, China, Daoist Deities of Heaven, Earth and Water, Deities, Southern Song, Triptych, Visual culture",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
1701285168,"Brazelton, Mary Augusta","Vaccinating the Nation: Public Health and Mass Immunization in Modern China, 1900–60",Contemporary,"The Second World War made vaccination a cornerstone of public health in China. When Japan invaded eastern China in 1937, the Nationalist government moved its wartime capital to Chongqing, in Sichuan. Physicians, biomedical researchers, and medical students fled with the Nationalists to China's southwest borderlands. Many found refuge in Kunming, capital of Yunnan province. While the Nationalist health administration at Chongqing attempted to address a variety of hygienic issues, in Kunming, a biomedical community emerged whose members focused their wartime work on epidemic control and especially the development of vaccines. I argue that this gathering of biomedical professionals in wartime Kunming gave vaccination new meaning as a comprehensive, essential practice in twentieth-century China. It also permitted the post-1949 development of large-scale health programs that immunized at least eighty-five percent of the Chinese population. Wartime experts developed a variety of new vaccines that found widespread use, and distribution systems for these vaccines that became the foundation of later nationwide health policies. At the onset of war, Yunnan's medical infrastructure had only recently become oriented toward the emerging Nationalist nation-state at Nanjing and away from French, British, and indigenous networks spanning Southeast Asia. The politics of vaccination and epidemic control in Yunnan before the war manifested intense power struggles between the British and French empires for a controlling influence there, but also suggested the endurance of Yunnanese warlords' authority over local public health into the wartime period. The war interrupted Chinese research, writing, and translation on immunology and vaccines in the early 1930s. After Japan invaded, the institutes and medical schools that gathered in Kunming included active participants in China's emerging immunological community, notably the staff of the National Epidemic Prevention Bureau (NEPB). The members of this community found that Yunnan's frontier environment, French-influenced medical infrastructure, and warlord government required significant adaptation and accommodation. As a critical tool of epidemic control, vaccination became a central focus for wartime research, manufacturing, and clinical testing during wartime outbreaks of cholera, typhoid fever, and plague. Researchers and physicians in wartime Kunming began to see themselves as participants in the developing field of Chinese immunology. They developed a novel vaccine production and distribution system that sought to vaccinate all members of the public in both rural and urban areas against a host of diseases. Kunming was a major center of research and development in wartime China, but it was not the only site of its kind. A new biomedical network emerged across China's wartime hinterland, and the research and production of vaccines was a common endeavor that linked many cities in this network. International biomedical interest groups facilitated Chinese development of a variety of vaccines. A major wartime project sponsored by the League of Nations enfolded Yunnan and most of western China into a global vaccine supply network that reached as far as Buenos Aires, Bucharest, and Cairo. The people responsible for building this medical network across China's wartime southwest quickly returned to their home institutions once the war ended and the Japanese retreated. While China collapsed into civil war between 1945 and 1949, these figures, especially the staff of the Epidemic Prevention Bureau, remained on the mainland and continued to oversee national vaccine production and distribution. After 1949, the new People's Republic of China (PRC) popularized vaccination on an unprecedented scale. The PRC provided mandatory, universal, free vaccination in mass mobilization campaigns against a variety of diseases. District public health stations in Kunming implemented these procedures and, by the beginning of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, demonstrated the extent to which vaccination had become a basic responsibility of local government and an emergent feature of citizenship in the early PRC. The origin of modern universal vaccination practices in wartime epidemic control therefore demonstrates a significant legacy of the Nationalist state in the early PRC.",2015,2015,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"Asian History, Science history, Twentieth century, History of medicine, Immunology, Kunming, Public health, Vaccination, China",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304773397,"Huang, Hongyu","History, romance, and identity: Wu Weiye (1609–1672) and his literary legacy",Modern,"This dissertation explores history, romance and personal identity in the work of Wu Weiye, a master poet of late imperial China. Wu's sequence of narrative songs concerning the Ming-Qing dynastic succession has exerted an immense influence both on our understanding of dynastic history and on the themes and styles of subsequent Chinese narrative verse. Despite a general recognition of Wu's status as a major Qing poet, literary scholars have tended to neglect late imperial Chinese poetry. meanwhile moral absolutists have regarded Wu's political allegiance to two dynasties as an indelible stain on his literary output. My dissertation examines Wu's place in the Chinese narrative tradition through a tripartite approach of motif study, genre study and influence study. While confined to a single author, my dissertation provides new insights into literary relations, in particular issues of influence, intertextuality and innovation. Attempting to redress the balance regarding China's alleged dearth of narrative poetry, I argue that Wu's lyrics create a new literary space that filters extensive historical narratives through the poet's lyric subjectivity. An inquiry into Wu, a true developer of the Tang masters, sheds new light on the afterlife of Tang poetry. At the same time, many of Wu's poems borrow elements from contemporary chuanqi tales and drama, and in turn have exerted influence on later fiction and theatre. By exploring the unprecedented diversity and intermingling of literary genres during the Qing Dynasty, this study challenges the widely held assumption about the absolute primacy of one or two particular genres in each period and instead paints a more balanced and nuanced picture of late imperial literature. The dissertation consists of an introduction, four chapters and three appendixes. Chapter 1 discusses Wu's war poems and the Chinese tradition of poetry as witness to historical trauma. Chapter 2 discusses Wu's romance narratives and the Chinese discourse on creatures of enchanting beauty. Chapter 3 examines Wu's fictionalized biography Liu Jingting zhuan and its transmission.

305039766,"Yang, Wei","Myth, spectacle, memory: Envisioning history in contemporary Hong Kong literature and film",Contemporary,"Myth, spectacle, and memory—these are three alternative ways to capture and account for an elusive past, each with its own claim and flaw. This dissertation traces the vicissitude of historical consciousness in contemporary Hong Kong, aiming to demonstrate how representations of history are aestheticized and how these aesthetic forms, knowingly or unknowingly, resist the hegemony of identity politics. The three decades from 1970s to 2000 were one of those fanatical moments in Hong Kong, when the notion of history reemerged, condensed and imploded, generating as much tension as energy. Propelled by the imminence of the sovereignty handover, debates have continued in the public sphere around the issue of local identity. When the geopolitical definition of the city had to undergo an indefinite and contingent revision, history was reinstated to play a leading role in the political anchoring of Hong Kong's collective identity. The crafting of history has thus turned into a massive campaign in various realms of culture. When identity politics serves as a focal point for nearly all literary and film creation, culture becomes more or less a survival strategy. The insistence on a specific, coherent, and continuous identity works to reduce the diversity and complexity of cultural and social influences under which local identity is formed. However, this discursive synergy of history making has also given rise to a different kind of cultural practice, one that has surpassed the content and contour of the given agenda. The innovation and resilience displayed in these works, in my opinion, reveal admirable strength and the ability to sustain and articulate who one really is, by providing alternatives to augment self-understanding and to defy the homogenizing, exclusionary process of identity formation. The dissertation exemplifies how different layers and forms of historical narratives invent, appropriate, reshuffle, and contest the historical “real,” which, like identity, can never be fully conveyed. The thesis is organized into two parts along the parallel lines of literature and film. The first three chapters embrace and/or contradict the notion of history as myth, spectacle and memory, respectively. whereas the fourth chapter provides a spatial analogue for this largely time-oriented project.",2009,2009,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"Asian literature, Film studies, China, Film, History, Hong Kong, Myth, Spectacle",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
303934808,"Ko, Susan Schor",Literary politics in the Han,Ancient,"This dissertation focuses on the Han dynasty in China (202 B.C.-A.D. 220) which was a formative period for the canonization of classical texts and schools of commentary. It was also a crucial time when scholars were defining their relationship to the state. The pre-Han period presented the models and paradigms by which Han scholars measured their early progress. The ambiguities of their role in serving the state were already evident to the Confucians. It is at this intersection of the literary and the political spheres that a unique tension in Chinese intellectual life was first formed. In Part One I have established the background of classical studies, investigating the system of the Six Classics with an emphasis on the history of the Book of Odes (Shih-ching) and its schools of interpretation. By following the careers of early Odes masters, I show how the Confucians attempted to monopolize classical studies just as they tried to reach a dominant position within the government of Emperor Wu (141-87 B.C.). Incidents which demonstrate the solidarity of the scholar group as well as the rivalries are noted throughout the dissertation. In Part Two I trace the politics of school formation and examine the careers of some famous Odes scholars who influenced the course of government in the post-Emperor Wu period. Examples are given of the manner in which material from the Odes was used in political dialogue. I show the process by which schools were altered and expanded, and new schools admitted to official status--a trend which abruptly ends at the conclusion of the Former Han when attempts to gain official sanction for alternative texts are rebuffed. In looking at these alternative traditions such as the Tso commentary and the ancient text Documents, I expose the network of relationships among the adherents of these schools with those of the Odes.

The central thesis of the dissertation is that Gu's major work, the Record of Daily Learning, developed a mixed model approach to power, money and mores that sought to combine central state authoritarianism with local responsiveness. The study further argues that Gu's blend of statism and localism was a response to the problem of two kinds of despotism, one from above and the other from below. The primary source-base is the Record of Daily Learning itself. Comparisons between the first edition, printed in 1670, and the second edition, published posthumously in 1695, highlight the development of Gu's arguments in the 1660s and 1670s. Passages from a rare manuscript version of Gu's research notes also corroborate key points of the dissertation's thesis. The first two chapters, drawing on Gu's rich correspondence, piece together his intellectual milieu, focusing on the two decades he spent researching, publishing and revising the Record of Daily Learning. Gu's life experiences substantiate the idea that his anxiety over the informal despotism of local elites fed statist undercurrents in his political writings. Gu maintained close relationships with Qing county, provincial and court officials, many of whom were avid readers of his work. Gu's proposals for improved government and Confucian revival resonated with central tenets of court policy in the early Kangxi reign. Chapter three explains Gu's mixed model approach. Interspersing the writings of other political thinkers gives a wider sense of the debate in the early Qing between the two constitutional models of fengjian versus junxian, and the possibility of a third way. In chapter four, on Gu's ideas about economics, the story of his involvement in a 1666 land reclamation project illuminates the complex political environment in which Ming loyalists worked closely with Qing collaborators at the local level to restore China's stability and prosperity. The final chapter explores Gu's unfinished movement toward putting commonality ( tianxia ) ahead of the state ( guo ).

2300000025,"Wang, Mengxiao",Interactions and Negotiations between Theater and Buddhism in Late Imperial China,Modern,"This dissertation investigates how the interplay between Buddhism and theater facilitated new forms of playwriting, theatrical performance, and Buddhist practice in late imperial China. Existing scholarship traces the roots of Chinese theater to ancient ritual and regards religious drama as a medium for transmitting doctrines and spreading cults. Such works create a false impression that theater and religion were always unified in China. My dissertation argues that there are tensions between the Buddhist values of asceticism and the function of theater as entertainment, which posed a dilemma for Chinese Buddhist playwrights who engaged in both religious and theatrical practices. I examine their strategies to reconcile this dilemma by transforming the dramatic genre and the resistance from the genre itself. My dissertation presents a comprehensive analysis of Ming-Qing Buddhist monks' discussions on theater with case studies of three individual plays. After examining dozens of extant plays with Buddhist motifs in late imperial China, I choose several examples that include a meta-theatrical contemplation of the genre. These plays are the Buddhist layman Tu Long's (屠隆, 1543-1605) Tanhuaji (曇花記, Story of the Udumbara Flower), Monk Zhida's (智達, circa 1650) Guiyuanjing (歸元鏡, Mirror of the Return to the Origin), and the dramatist Shen Qifeng's (沈起鳳, 1741-?) Fuhutao (伏虎韜, Strategy of Taming the Tiger). All three plays focus on theater—either reflecting on the tensions between drama and Buddhism or reenacting Buddhist rituals in the form of play-within-a-play. Chapter one examines how Ming-Qing Buddhist masters adopted theater as a rhetorical tool for sermonizing, while considering playwriting and attending the theater as transgressions of Buddhist precepts. Chapter two investigates how Tu Long attempted to realize his ideal of attaining enlightenment through writing Tanhuaji and directing its performance with his family troupe. Chapter three explores Monk Zhida's aspiration to convert his play Guiyuanjing into a sacred text, which has been realized on the page but defeated on the stage in its historical reception. Chapter four studies how the dramatist and performers of Fuhutao parodied Buddhist sermons and the conventional narrative of an underworld trial to entertain the audience. Together, these chapters offer a new perspective to view Buddhism as a repertoire for different people who engaged in theatrical productions: while Buddhist monks and laymen endeavored to turn playwriting and performing into ritualistic practices, dramaturgs and actors mocked devotional activities to create theatrical spectacles. My project is the first to discover the complete preface to Tanhuaji, multiple woodblock editions and manuscripts of Guiyuanjing, and a performance manuscript of Fuhutao with abundant stage directions. A comparative reading of various versions of each play illuminates how texts and paratexts construct a discursive space for playwrights, readers, commentators, publishers, and actors to communicate their negotiations between Buddhist regulations and theatrical norms both on the page and on the stage. By integrating traditional philology with interdisciplinary methods, this study proposes a new way of reading literary texts with religious motifs—not just as source materials for the study of religious history, but also as material objects with their own textual histories and generic conventions. The theatrical genre did not merely serve as a transparent medium for religious doctrines, but became a problematic medium that both invited and challenged Buddhist regulations in late imperial China. My study enriches our understanding of both theater and Buddhism in late imperial China. Due to the boundaries dividing different fields in modern academia, scholars of religious studies and literature often overlook the intersections between their disciplines. Scholars of Chinese literature have discussed the issue of theatricality based on analyses of well-known texts, but have rarely included plays with Buddhist themes in their discussions. On the other hand, scholars of Chinese Buddhism have investigated religious activities of Buddhist masters and their literati disciples, but have scarcely taken into account their writings concerning drama. However, Ming-Qing individuals were not confined to a single identity, either as Buddhist experts or as professional writers. Their diverse cultural modalities call for a space of exchange between theatrical and religious studies. My interdisciplinary dissertation concludes that new forms of ritualistic and theatrical performances—ritual mediated by theatricality and theater transformed into Buddhist sermon—emerged from Buddhist playwrights' efforts to reconcile their religious and literary practices in late imperial China. It demonstrates how the dynamics between theater and Buddhism have reshaped the landscapes of both fields in the Ming-Qing periods, offering a new approach to both literary and religious studies.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,East Asian Languages and Literatures,East Asian Studies,"Buddhism, Chinese literature, Late imperial china, Theater,",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
4630000078,"Chen, Po-hsi",Socialism on One Island: A Genealogy of the Pro-unification Leftist Literary Discourse in Taiwan,Contemporary,"The “pro-unification Left” (or zuo tong) in Taiwan refers to the political identification with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the ideological identification with leftism. In the binary Cold War division, Taiwan was labelled as the “Free China” as against the Communist China. However, in the 1970s, a controversial group of writers that hailed from Taiwan, including Liu Daren, Guo Songfen, Li Yü, and Chen Yingzhen, identified themselves as leftists and advocated (re)unification with mainland China. By analyzing their political manifestoes, philosophical treatises, (auto)biographical sketches, and fictional accounts, I investigate why they aspired to the PRC as a socialist utopia and why they expressed their ideals mainly through literary discourses. For the pro-unification Left, reconciliation between the two political entities across the Taiwan Straits is a missing link in the ultimate fulfillment of a socialist China, which for these writers has been torn asunder first by Western and Japanese imperialism since the late nineteenth century, and then by the U.S. Cold War intervention in East Asia since the mid-twentieth century. These global events gave rise to multiple conflicting forms of national and ideological identification that began with the Defending Diaoyutai Movement in the early 1970s, and culminated at the native soil literature debate in the late 1970s. The pro-unification Left has been relatively marginalized compared to the two other mainstream literary paradigms: the Sinocentric literary historiography in the 1950s, which considered Taiwan the base that preserves quintessential Chineseness to counter communist infiltration, and Taiwanese cultural nationalism that gradually came to prominence since the late 1970s, which opposes framing Taiwanese literature within the greater China. Wrestling with both anticommunist literature and Taiwanese cultural nationalism, the pro-unification Left had to compromise and negotiate with the other ideological camps in its attempt to rewrite national history through literature. Drawing on the notion of “left-wing melancholia” in Western Marxism, I note that the negative feelings of anguish (kumen), sadness, and regret expressed in the works of the pro-unification leftist writers are derived from the spatiotemporal severance from their aspired revolutionary mecca and left-wing literary genealogies. While they claimed to inherit the ideological creed from revolutionary Chinese or anti-colonial Taiwanese literary traditions in the 1930s, the legacy had already been eradicated by the KMT authoritarian censorship in the early 1950s. Hence, when these writers embarked on their literary careers since the 1960s, they had to resort to what they would later denounce as the petty bourgeois emulation of Western aesthetics—existentialism (Chapter One), modernism (Chapter Two), and postmodernism (Chapter Three)—to express their leftism. After the lifting of martial law, writers from both the pro-independence and pro-unification leftist camps engaged in what I term as the “biographical competition”—i.e., writing biographical accounts in order to make a legitimate claim to his or her left-wing legacy (Chapter Four). In conclusion, I note that the motifs of “political reorientation” (tenkō) and betrayal recur in their fictional accounts of revolutionary activities, and argue that the act of “betraying revolution” often stems from the feeling of being “betrayed by revolution”; hence, betrayal sometimes signifies an even deeper reflection on the revolutionary cause.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,East Asian Languages and Literatures,East Asian Studies,"China, Cold War, Melancholia, Revolution, Socialism, Taiwanese literature,",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
2290000000,"Zhang, Huasha","Our Kind of Tibetans: The Political Life and Times of Liu Manqing, 1906–1942",Contemporary,"Liu Manqing (1906–1942) was born in Qing-dominated Tibet to a family of Chinese and Tibetan heritage. She spent her initial years in Lhasa before the implosion of the Qing Empire (1636–1911) drove the Lius first to the Himalayas and then to the Republic of China (1912–1949). After a decade living and studying in China, Manqing became a politician in the Chinese Nationalist government (1927–1949), and she worked on behalf of, traveled across, and wrote about China and Tibet between 1928 and 1940. In the contemporary academic realm of the Sino-Tibetan relationship, Manqing is known as a remarkable figure who, through her 1929–1930 mission from Nanjing to Lhasa and her meetings with the Thirteenth Dalai Lama (1876–1933) during the mission, contributed to the rebuilding of the Sino-Tibetan communicative channel that was severed after the Qing collapsed and Tibet achieved autonomous status. She is also known for her multicultural background, her multilingual abilities, and the myths and contentions regarding her political, ethnic, and gender identities. Despite Manqing's growing popularity in China and internationally in recent years, few studies have examined her beyond her role as a Chinese government emissary or used her abundant written texts to understand the author rather than the early-twentieth-century Sino-Tibetan political and social situations that she recorded. In response to this academic direction, in the present work, I situate Manqing's missions and writings within the context of her turbulent personal history. I also situate Manqing's personal experiences in the Liu family, who carried out multi-generational migrations across China and Tibet from the mid-Qing to the twentieth century, adopting multiple ethnic, cultural, and linguist identities along the way. In addition to sketching a portrait of a family and an individual who traversed great geographical and cultural distances and claimed the ownership of various identities (Chapters 2 and 3), I pay special attention to Manqing's two legendary missions across China and Tibet in 1929–1930 (Chapters 3 and 4) and in 1939 (Chapter 5). During the missions, Manqing engaged with not only the intricate Sino-Tibetan political and social landscapes but also her own identities through her performances on the road and through the narratives that she crafted in reflection of her experiences. I also scrutinize Manqing's resurrections and reinterpretations in the People's Republic of China (1949–present, Chapter 6). By investigating Manqing's production of distinctive political, ethnic, and gender identities via physical, literary, and visual means, I explore the tensions among state-, community-, familial-, and individual-level agents. By interrogating Manqing's transformations of her identities under different times and situations, I discuss the influences of temporal and spatial factors in the definition of an individual's political, ethnic, and gender identities. I also evaluate the forces that shaped and reshaped the relationship between China and Tibet in both the modern and contemporary eras through the experiences of someone who, in addition to being impacted by, contributed to and reacted against such forces. My findings demonstrate that a thorough investigation of Manqing reveals as much about the ever-evolving modern-to-contemporary history of the Sino-Tibetan relationship as it does about her as a significant actor in it. My examination of Manqing illuminates a symbiosis between Manqing and the Chinese state on the Tibet front—a symbiosis that is as mutually beneficial as it is detrimental to both parties—that existed during Manqing's lifetime, has been perpetuated in the contemporary era, and is about to take a new form in the second decade of the twenty-first century. Such an unlikely but persistent mutualism between an authoritarian state and a mere individual testifies to the precarious distance between China's imagined and realistic connections with Tibet. It also testifies to Manqing's unique position in deciphering the conundrum that is the modern-to-contemporary history of the Sino-Tibetan relationship.",2019,2019,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,History,History,"China, Ethnicity, Gender, Manqing, Liu, Sino-Tibetan relationship, Tibet, Qing Dynasty, Thirteenth Dalai Lama,",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States

The dissertation focuses specifically on the development of the “Zhejiangcun” (Zhejiang Village), the largest migrant settlement in Beijing. Based on fifteen months of ethnographic fieldwork, this dissertation shows that the Zhejiangcun experienced several crucial moments when the structural configuration consisting of different levels of the state bureaucracy, various social forces, official ideologies and unofficial discourses, shifted to encompass variant patterns of domination. In other words, different sets of power alliances have formed as the result of struggles and accommodations between state and society, creating diverse structures of domination in the Zhejiangcun. Thus, as the meeting ground for the Post-Mao state and the migrants, the Zhejiangcun has been a space in which conflict and complicity, opposition and coalition, corruption and co-optation have determined the shape of social and political changes. Based on this recognition, this dissertation argues that the renegotiation between the Post-Mao state and the Zhejiangcun migrants have resulted in the continuous transformation of state-society relations.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"Cultural anthropology, Political science, History, China, Floating population, State power, Urban space",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304553757,"Shiue, Carol Hua",Grain trade and storage in late imperial China,Modern,"Although it is recognized that a large volume of grain was traded along water routes in 18th century China, little is known about the degree of market development and market integration in areas more distant from these routes. This study identifies the spatial and temporal extent of market integration in quantitative terms for ten major provinces of China, and it examines the role of public relief measures in smoothing fluctuations in the price of grain. One measure of the effectiveness of markets is how well it allows production shocks to be smoothed across regions. Using price and harvest data from 1723–1735, Chapter 2 shows that an aggregate weighted index of national price fluctuations had a greater impact on the market prices of grain in provincial capitals than local harvests. This finding holds regardless of whether a province is located directly on a major river or not, and suggests that existing price fluctuations across regions were primarily non-idiosyncratic in nature. Chapter 3 extends the analysis over the years from 1742–1795 with a new data set drawn from previously unpublished documents, and focuses on the geographic advantage available to regions with access to low-cost water transportation. Within a framework of competitive equilibrium for trade and storage, I demonstrate that a significant interregionally integrated market (up to an average of 150 kilometers distance from a major transport route) for rice existed already in the 18th century. Furthermore, regions which were not spatially trading with each other relied on intertemporal forms of arbitrage by storing, and thus were integrated through markets across time. Another main finding is that no geographic region in the late 18th century was still significantly vulnerable to bad local harvest shocks. Chapter 4 focuses on the role of public disaster aid, and the interaction between private markets and public famine relief in smoothing consumption fluctuations. I impose the pattern of spatial and intertemporal consumption smoothing found in previous chapters as determining the effectiveness of public relief, and hypothesize that the marginal benefit of disaster relief is larger in regions less integrated through markets than in those that are more integrated. The findings confirm this hypothesis. I find that public relief had relatively less of an impact on local storage patterns where private markets for interregional trade were most developed. This is consistent with the general conclusion of the previous chapters that existing markets were more effective in absorbing income shocks than previously realized. Overall, the findings emphasize the need to re-evaluate the development of private market in pre-industrial economies.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"Economics, Economic history, Agricultural economics, History, China, Grain trade, Imperial, Storage",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304541292,"Lowry, John Sheppard","Wilhelmine imperialism, overseas resistance and German domestic politics: The case of the Center Party, 1897–1906",Contemporary,"Noting the impact since 1945 of anti-imperialist resistance movements upon political constellations in the metropolitan powers, this study addresses the question whether before 1914 the resistance of populations subject to imperialism generated consequences of sufficient significance to influence domestic politics in Germany. More specifically, it explores the extent to which such resistance in the years from 1897 to 1906 affected the relationship between the Reich government and the Catholic Center party, the swing bloc of votes in the Reichstag during the period in question. Hans-Ulrich Wehler's model of “social imperialism” as a governmental sociopolitical diversionary strategy is accordingly tested against the colonial- and pseudocolonial-political developments of the mid-Wilhelmme period. The study concludes that from 1897 to 1906 anti-imperialist resistance movements in Africa, Asia, the South Seas and the Caribbean frequently and at times decisively influenced Wilhelmine domestic politics, but not in a uniform manner. In those pseudocolonial or foreign colonial venues where German national and Roman Catholic interests were generally closely aligned, as in China, Cuba, the Philippines and Samoa, resistance movements usually redounded to the benefit of the Reich's ruling elite by providing opportunities to gratify the Center's constituency cheaply without domestic concessions. On the other hand, resistance movements in German-occupied Africa arose in contexts where church-state interests clashed or where the Center's fiscal concerns predominated on the question of the costs of colonial uprisings. In these latter circumstances anti-imperialist resistance overseas seriously undermined and ultimately destroyed the government-Center partnership. The extensive evidence for the predominantly African roots of the Reichstag dissolution of December 1906 deals a blow to the applicability to that moment in history of the thesis of social-imperialist manipulation from above. The period from 1897 to 1901 is a more promising field of exploration for the social-imperialist rubric, but even here the Reich practiced only an impromptu form of that strategy.",1999,1999,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"European history, History, Africa, Center Party, China, Domestic politics, German, Imperialism, Wilhelmine",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304641072,"Andrade, Tonio Adam","Commerce, culture, and conflict: Taiwan under European rule, 1624–1662",Modern,"This study examines the history of Taiwan from 1624, when the Dutch established the first European fortress on the island, to 1662, when they surrendered that fortress to Ming loyalist Zheng Cheng-gong. It treats both the Spanish and the Dutch colonies, focusing on interactions between Europeans, Chinese settlers, and the island's Austronesian aborigines. During the thirty-eight years during which the Europeans ruled Taiwan, the Chinese population of the island grew from around 1500 to 25,000. This increase occurred mostly in southwestern Taiwan, in the Dutch colony. Indeed, the Dutch encouraged Chinese immigration, giving subventions and tax-breaks to Chinese farmers and protecting Chinese hunters, fishers, and traders from aboriginal attacks. In exchange the Dutch collected taxes and tolls from the Chinese, who were much better at converting the island's ecology into cash than were the aborigines. As one Dutch administrator put it, “The Chinese are the only bees on Formosa that give honey.” By the mid 1640s, an odd system of colonialism had been born: a Chinese colony under Dutch rule. I call this system “co-colonization,” for European and Chinese colonists depended closely on each other. The Dutch provided military force and an administrative framework, creating a pax hollandica . The Chinese colonists took advantage of the Dutch umbrella to hunt, fish, and plant. By the late 1640s the aborigines in Southwest Taiwan had begun to feel the system's effects, as their hunting grounds became depleted and were converted into rice and sugarcane fields. The system was not entirely stable. Chinese organizations—traders, pirates, and, most importantly, the Zheng family—often undermined company sovereignty. Nor did the aborigines sit idly while the newcomers divided their hunting fields: they played the foreigners off against each other, especially in the colony's early years, when Japanese traders were present. A crisis came in the 1650s and 1660s, when the powerful Zheng family began looking for a new base of operations.",2000,2000,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"European history, History, China, Colonialism, Commerce, Conflict, Culture, Dutch East India Company, Netherlands, Spain, Taiwan, The Netherlands",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States

In order to crush the An Lushan rebellion that occurred in the mid-eighth century, the Tang dynasty was forced to use newly recruited professional armies to replace its dysfunctional self-supporting peasant militia. Since supplying large professional troops demanded unprecedented military budget, the imperial state adopted aggressive mercantile policies to enlarge its revenue base. In the later dynasties that adopted professional army system, therefore, the government took initiatives to build a sophisticated paddy fields system in Jiangnan as the physical container for the most productive agriculture in the pre-modern world. The long distance transportation of military supplies underwritten by merchants created a complex national trade network. Eventually, Jiangnan economy developed into a highly urbanized agrarian system, combining agriculture, trade and proto-industries. However, the effectiveness of the state action led to rapid centralization of financial power in the government, at the expense of the growth of local institutions. In the late imperial era when the state failed to explore new economic frontiers after most lands had been reclaimed, the local society did not have financial resources and viable institutions to take initiatives in economic development.

It focuses upon Taishanese sojourners in the United States during the Republican era and the cultural, social and economic accommodations made by Taishanese in maintaining family, village, clan, and community relationships despite long-term, long-distance separations. A key argument is that Taishanese were extremely adept in adapting their cultural practices and expectations of family life, loyalty to native-place, and kinship organization to survive and even thrive amidst adversarial conditions in the U.S. Their adjustments to living transnationaily are examined from several vantage points: the development of Taishan's local-place specialization of sojourning in the United States and its impact on the culture, society, and economy of Taishan. the networks of kinship and native-place based in Taishan that enabled Taishanese American men to circumvent U.S. laws excluding Chinese as well as sustain narrow economic niches. the well-being of families that provided the main motivation for migration, but only at the cost of long-term separations from the family itself. and the evolving strategies of community organizations to maintain long-distance loyalties and commitments on the part of overseas Taishanese through the publication of local news and gossip in magazines.

It focuses on the relationship between Wilsonian rhetoric, the opportunities for international action created by the Paris Peace Conference, and the nearly simultaneous nationalist upheavals that erupted in the spring of 1919 in four disparate societies: Egypt, India, China and Korea. This study contends that the 1919 Revolution in Egypt, the Rowlatt Satyagraha in India, the May Fourth movement in China, and the March First uprising in Korea should be understood in the context of a broader “Wilsonian moment” that encouraged challenges to the norms of the prewar international order. It shows how emerging national movements outside the West appropriated Wilsonian language, refracted through local lenses, and adapted it to their own use, transforming its meaning in the process. it also argues that the rapid disintegration of the Wilsonian promise left a legacy of disillusionment that facilitated the spread of revisionist ideologies and movements in these societies. The vast literature on the Peace Conference of 1919 is written almost exclusively from the perspectives of the great powers. Non-Western regions, aside from Japan, appear largely as inert masses of territory and humanity carved up among the victorious powers. This study, based on research in three continents and four languages, including Arabic and Chinese, restores these submerged voices in the international history of the period. It examines not only perceptions and actions of official and semi-official representatives, but also the role of popular action, the press, civic groups and overseas communities, who both reflected and participated in events on the international stage.

It argues that the all-encompassing, metropolitan style of the Tang (618–907) arts was replaced with a retrospective aesthetic that was inspired by bronzes of China's high antiquity. The antiquarian trend, first advocated by scholar-officials in the court, was a branch of their cultural enterprise. Its goal was to restore Chinese culture to its prime state of antiquity in response to the foreign, barbarian military challenges that threatened the Song Empire. As factional hostilities mounted in emperor Huizong's (r. 1101–1125) court, antiquities became one of the weapons by which Huizong and his high officials fought their opponents. This political conflict gave rise to antiquarianism in the mid eleventh century and fueled its later development, causing dramatic changes in ritual objects and fine porcelains in Huizong's court. During the Southern Song (1127–1279), through the mediation of antiquarian catalogues, this cultural ideal spread beyond the court to wider audiences and had an immense impact on material culture. Illustrated with images of ancient bronzes and bronze inscriptions, catalogues by Northern Song antiquarians were epitomes of their scholarly accomplishments. After put into print, they further assumed the role of the mass media, spreading images of antiquities in a variety of forms. In addition, the printed catalogues also served as a kind of pattern book, from which ancient forms could be chosen and reworked to create archaic-looking objects. The direction of influence, however, was not one way. As archaism permeated the material world, features of recreated archaic objects were fused into catalogues during later re-cutting and reprinting. Contextual analysis further suggests that the appropriation of ancient bronze forms in the Southern Song moved beyond a formal borrowing to codify serious intents of their owners and their reactions to the cultural tradition they chose to inherit.",2010,2010,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, Art history, Antiquarianism, Antiquity, Archaism, China, Fugu, Kaogo tu, Material culture, Print era, Sanli tu, Song dynasty, Xuanhe bogu tu",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
1687713560,"Hu, Danian","Einstein and His Relativity Theory in China: The Introduction, Assimilation, and Reaction, 1917-1979",Contemporary,"This dissertation is the first systematic study of China’s reception of relativity. It addresses the following questions: How and why was relativity introduced to China? What contributed to the intense interest in Einstein and his relativity theory in the early 1920s? In what way was the Chinese assimilation of relativity unique? What contributed to post-1949 changes in the Chinese assessment of Einstein and his relativity, in which Einstein’s image was transformed from scientific hero to reactionary enemy? Einstein’s theory of relativity was introduced into China by Chinese scholars educated in Japan in 1917, and it became widely disseminated in the early 1920s. By the end of 1920s, Chinese physicists had successfully assimilated relativity. Bertrand Russell’s lectures in China and Albert Einstein’s planned visit to Beijing early in the 1920s helped the dissemination, but the major contribution to China’s reception of relativity came from a group of Chinese scientists. China’s reception of relativity was unanimously positive before 1949. That affirmative position on relativity, however, gradually changed after 1949 and so did the heroic public image of Einstein. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), radical leftists fanned political and philosophical criticism of the theory of relativity and denounced Einstein as the top “reactionary bourgeois authority” blocking progress in science. It was not until 1979 that the Chinese government rehabilitated Einstein and officially restored his glorious image. This research has identified the significant Japanese influence on China’s introduction of relativity. The intense Chinese interest in Einstein and his relativity was part of the Chinese enthusiasm for Western science during the May Fourth movement. The absence of a tradition of education in classical physics in China may actually have helped the quick and unanimously positive reception of relativity in the 1920s. China’s reception of relativity was instrumental in the rise of theoretical physics as an independent discipline in China. The negative transformation of Einstein’s public image after 1949 evidenced the political and ideological interference with China’s scientific development. The dissertation is divided into four chapters. The first summarizes the introduction of Western physics before the introduction of relativity. the second investigates how Einstein’s theory of relativity was introduced into China. the third examines the Chinese assimilation of the theory. and finally the fourth discusses the evolution of Einstein’s public image in China and its causes. It is hoped that this study of China’s reception of relativity will illustrate the conditions for scientific development and especially for the development of theoretical physics in 20th-century China, in which Albert Einstein—even when seen negatively by the state—was crucial to this development.",2001,2001,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, Asian Studies, Science history, China, Chinese physicists, Chinese science, Cultural revolution, Einstein, albert, May fourth movement, Theory of relativity",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304424813,"Ransmeier, Johanna Sirera","No other choice: The sale of people in late Qing and Republican Beijing, 1870–1935",Contemporary,"This dissertation uncovers trafficked people in the neighborhoods and alleyways of Qing and Republican Beijing. In doing so, the study demonstrates the extent to which a practice which was rhetorically considered a last resort was actually routinely tolerated and facilitated by local community networks. In 1910 the Qing government approved ten regulations for the prohibition of buying and selling people. The act was trumpeted internationally as China's abolition of slavery. In reality, despite these changes to the law, intermediaries continued to supply a robust market for servants, wives, concubines, child-brides, prostitutes, and even adopted children. By the middle of the Qing Dynasty servile labor no longer played a major role in the overall productive economy. The labor of sold people, however, remained significant in the reproductive economy for at least another century. Many families throughout the Qing, and indeed well into the Republican period, relied upon the menial domestic, child-rearing, and child-bearing labor of purchased people. Thus, families with means had a vital stake in the continuation of the practice. Their interests significantly hindered enforcement of the prohibition. I have identified the complicity of the family as crucial to the perpetuation of a diverse system of bondage in Beijing and its surrounding area. Creating and maintaining a traditional hierarchical family often proved more important than adhering to new laws. The period studied straddles not only the abolition of slavery, but also the demise of the Qing government, the founding of a supreme court, and the promulgation of a civil code. For sold people, this changing legal system offered opportunities to challenge their masters' customary dominance in court. The principle sources for the dissertation are over 350 court cases and supporting police investigations. Judicial records from the archives for Beijing and Shuntian Prefecture show that an extensive market for human beings existed both before and after the abolition of slavery. This market involved various forms of bondage, typically occurring in the home, and not on the auction block or in the fields. Laws prohibiting the sale of people enable the historian to see this activity, but they are not what defined it. Trafficking served an invaluable purpose. It supplied middle-wealth families with the means to replicate traditional extended family structures even as national changes strained those structures. At the same time, it offered impoverished families a way to lighten their burden. Families invested in this crime to preserve their traditions, while traffickers and intermediaries pointed to tradition to explain their actions.",2008,2008,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, Beijing, China, Family, Family in China, Human trafficking, Late Qing law, Qing dynasty, Republican China, Slavery, Trafficking",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States

My examination begins with the exchange in ideas and publications between Chinese reformers and classically trained Vietnamese nationalists while both their countries underwent radical changes. Many of the issues, shared by the two societies and mutually intelligible through the written language of classical Chinese, dealt with foreign influence and Western ideas, the rejection or modification of a partially Confucian society, and the exploration of different strategies to create new modern citizens. As early as 1904, Vietnamese intellectuals had begun to domesticate the theories of Chinese reformers Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao whose cultural philosophy and interpretations of foreign texts would prove influential in the subsequent shaping of Vietnamese literary worlds. Although these exchanges are generally acknowledged as occurring during a formative period in Vietnamese intellectual history, they are often seen as philosophical musings without much relevance for a wider population. Even scholars conducting closer examinations have typically limited their discussions to the failure of new political organizations and to lists of new vocabulary. Further, these exchanges are invariably viewed only through an anti-colonialist and nationalist lens. Drawing on previously unexplored sources, such as the resources of the Han-Nom Institute in Hanoi, I argue that this intellectual trafficking constituted exposure to a new, global context. Many of the cultural ideas inspired by exposure to the Chinese reformers had profound intellectual and political repercussions in Vietnam. these exchanges were not limited just to brush conversations 1 among members of an elite. Many of the emergent ideas did intersect with the birth of fledgling nations, but they are equally representative of exposure to a new, global context. From a cultural concern with the role of women in a new world, to the molding of a new citizenry by dissemination of heroic foreign biographies---the discussions during this period signal a rare moment that had transformative repercussions for twentieth century Vietnamese political, cultural and intellectual history. 1 Chinese reformer Liang Qichao and his Vietnamese colleague Phan Boi Chau communicated with each other through brush conversations in classical Chinese, as neither could understand the other's spoken language.",2006,2006,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, Biographies, China, Intellectual history, Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, Radical, Reformers, Vietnam",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States

In particular, questions concerning imperial influence, corruption, administrative control, fiscal problems, and technical competency are examined. Major sources include archival documents from the Palace Museum Archives and the No. One Historical Archives, gazetteers, biographical writings, and published materials. The first chapter describes the geologic, geographic and hydraulic circumstances which make the Yellow River especially difficult to control, outlines the long-term development of the river conservancy bureaucracy, and traces the origins of hydraulic and administrative problems from late Ming (1368-1644) times to the early nineteenth century. The second chapter utilizes the 1837 debate over the introduction of brick as a dike construction material to examine the problem of innovation and assess the way in which imperial priorities affected hydraulic decisions. The three subsequent chapters focus on the impact of floods which took place along the Yellow River at Xiangfu (1841), Taoyuan (1842) and Zhongmou (1843). These chapters describe government response to flood disasters and detail subsequent relief measures, methods of labor organization and control, and repair techniques. The conclusion draws material from all five chapters to support the contention that fiscal malaise, administrative decline and long-term hydraulic developments all limited the state's ability to respond to the crisis of the Yellow River control system.",1989,1989,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, China",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304784930,"Weinstein, Jodi Lynn",Subsistence and sedition in southwest China: Local responses to Qing rule in eighteenth-century Guizhou,Modern,"This dissertation examines the ways in which the people of Guizhou adapted to a harsh natural environment and resisted the hegemonic advances of the Qing state. Combining archival materials, folk literature, and ethnographic studies, I demonstrate that the imperial state and local communities constantly struggled for control of political and cultural space within Guizhou. This project challenges earlier work on Guizhou which views the Qing state as the sole actor in the region by portraying local inhabitants as creative actors rather than passive recipients of imperial initiatives. Faced with an unfavorable climate and poor soils, Guizhou's local residents had for centuries relied upon what I term indigenous subsistence strategies—chiefly illegal activities such as robbery, raiding and banditry—to meet their basic needs. As long as the state presence in Guizhou remained light, local residents could pursue these strategies with impunity. In the 1720s, however, the central government imposed a new social and political order designed to transform all of Guizhou's residents into law-abiding Qing subjects and end the violence for which the province was notorious. Instead, in defiance of the state's increased presence, the people of Guizhou asserted their right to pursue and preserve the subsistence strategies that had sustained them for centuries. Criminal cases from the eighteenth century indicate that some individuals practiced a more traditional form of these strategies, usually involving petty theft and murder. Other individuals developed more sophisticated schemes that also served as vehicles for discontent with the Qing state. Until the late eighteenth century, Qing authorities prevented local crime and dissent from escalating into full-scale rebellion. In 1796, however, a local religious leader from southwestern Guizhou organized an uprising against the Qing. Spurred on by their charismatic leaders and supernatural beliefs, the rebels soon controlled all of southern and central Guizhou. Eventually, Qing troops regained control of the region, but similar insurrections persisted well into the nineteenth century. For many residents of Guizhou, subsistence needs continued to supersede any sense of fealty to the dynasty.",2007,2007,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, China, Eighteenth century, Guizhou, Local responses, Qing dynasty, Sedition, Subsistence",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304388029,"McDaniel, Laura Andrews","Jumping the dragon gate: Social mobility among storytellers in Shanghai, 1849-1949",Contemporary,"This dissertation explores changes in the social status of storytellers in the Shanghai region between 1849 and 1949, and identifies the factors that made this kind of social mobility possible. In the mid-nineteenth century, storytellers formed one of the lowest status-groups in Chinese society. They were poor, itinerant, uneducated, and had little access to traditional Chinese networks of support and control or to accepted avenues of social mobility (education, family influence, money, professional organizations, etc.). And yet by the 1930s and 1940s, some storytellers in the urban centers of Shanghai and Suzhou had attained stunning levels of wealth, fame, status and influence. I argue that this new class of high-status storytellers was largely a product of a new and changing urban environment in Shanghai: the emergence of new public arenas like storytelling houses, radio, and entertainment newspapers created unprecedented opportunities for social and monetary advancement. These new high-class storytellers were also the product of an environment they themselves created: their establishment of professional organizations, their cultivation of gang connections, and their manipulation of the cultural symbols of success all helped them to gain and maintain privileged access to the realm of elite status. Finally, these elite storytellers actually re-created the Shanghai urban environment. their actions and calculations resulted in the creation of a new hierarchy of urban space, in which sharper distinctions were drawn between city dwellers and country folk, between the urban center and its hinterland. By examining the ways in which one urban underclass maneuvered its way to the top in a rapidly changing urban environment, this dissertation contributes a new perspective to current debates about the nature of urban environments, the functions of the public sphere, theories of cultural construction, and the formation of ethnic and regional identities.",1997,1997,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, China, popular culture",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304399759,"Yoon, Wook",The Grand Council and the communication systems in the late Qing,Modern,"The Grand Council and the Communication Systems of the Late Qing aims to address an important question that has so far been unanswered. namely how the Grand Council and the memorial systems operated in the last decades of the Qing period, and what difference the railways, steamships and telegraph made to the official communications of the late Qing government. The first chapter contains an assessment of the changes that took place within the Grand Council in the given period, and includes findings of an investigation into the office, its buildings, its economic situation, and its employees and their daily routines and salaries. These clearly show that the Grand Council, which was established as an informal organization that would bypass the complicated regular bureaucracy, was itself firmly routinized and bureaucratized. The second chapter on the memorial systems deals mainly with the palace memorial system, but also includes some discussion on the routine memorial system. An investigation into the transmission speed of palace memorials demonstrates how the post station system suffered irrevocable damage during the rebellions of the second half of 19 th century, and how the railways and steamers made only a limited contribution to improving the efficiency of official communications. The delivery of documents between Beijing and the provinces were further exacerbated by the prolonged procedures for processing documents among the Beijing offices. The third chapter on the telegraph describes the Qing government's efforts to use this modern messenger system as a means of ensuring a reliable imperial communications. The Qing government reorganized the telegraph service as a semi-private business in order to save money. It also invented an enciphering method and enacted regulations in an attempt to ensure the security of its documents, and to protect the telegraph system. nevertheless, telegrams continued to be unsafe, expensive, and subject to long delays, and so they were eventually used only for a minor portion of governmental communications.

303934436,"Chou, Wan-yao","The 'kominka' movement: Taiwan under wartime Japan, 1937-1945",Contemporary,"This dissertation attempts to reconstruct and analyze the kominka movement--the Japanization campaign launched by the Japanese colonial government in Taiwan during the period 1937-1945 which aimed at making the Taiwanese true Japanese. Prior to Taiwan's annexation by Japan in 1895, Taiwan was a territory of China. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out and the kominka movement was essentially a wartime policy undertaken by Japan both to erase the Han Chinese identity of the Taiwanese people and to enhance the loyalty of the Taiwanese to the mother country. The kominka movement included the national language movement, the name-changing program, the military recruitment campaign, and reforms of native religion and social customs. The reforms of religion and customs entirely failed. however, the Taiwanese responses to the other three campaigns were complex and diverse. Official statistics show that by 1945 over 80% of the Taiwanese were capable of speaking Japanese, and about 7% of the Taiwanese may have adopted Japanese names. As to the military recruitment of the Taiwanese, the appearance of an overwhelming number of volunteers enabled the colonial government to claim great success in this campaign. On the other hand, official statistics were often highly inflated and cannot adequately reflect historical reality. Nonetheless, the kominka movement did not fail completely. While the name-changing program encountered obstinate resistance, the national language movement was the most successful, and the military recruitment campaign seemingly aroused enthusiasm among young Taiwanese. On the whole, the kominka movement exerted a great impact on young Taiwanese who came to maturity during the eight years of intense Japanization. In the final analysis, the kominka movement failed in cultural and religious aspects. thus it did not achieve its ultimate goal of transforming the Taiwanese into true Japanese. Nevertheless, this Japanization movement caused national identity problems among the young generation, and consequently left a far-reaching impact on post-colonial Taiwan.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, History, Social structure, China, Japanization, national language movement",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
276584564,"Wheeler, Charles James",Cross -cultural trade and trans -regional networks in the Port of Hoi An: Maritime Vietnam in the early modern era,Pre-modern,"This study links two simultaneous developments in the history of the South China Sea: the diffusion of Chinese overseas trade and shipping networks across maritime Asia, and the southern expansion of Vietnamese settlement and rule down the eastern Indochinese peninsula in the early modern period. This work shows how cross-cultural trade influenced historical patterns within a particular geographical region, in this case, the southern Vietnamese realm of Dang Trong (Cochinchina), ruled by the Nguyen clan. Specifically, it demonstrates how enterprising Chinese merchants set their own diasporic society firmly into the rapidly changing political, economic, and cultural landscape of the Indochinese peninsula, and in doing so, helped to shape the contours of modern Vietnam. This dissertation traces the development and decline of Chinese-dominated trade in Hoi An—known to Europeans as Faifo—a central Vietnamese port city that served as a key entrepot in the South China Sea trade during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Using an Annales approach, the study develops a regional history of overseas trade in the port's rivershed, set in the larger context of the South China Sea as its own distinct, maritime region. Exploiting a network of clans, guilds and temple associations expanding throughout Asia, Hoi An's diasporic, Chinese mercantile community developed transportation links deep into the hinterland and across the seas, in order to consolidate their dominant position in the city-port. Successful in forging relationships with Vietnamese locals and officials thanks to shared norms, the Chinese were successful at shutting out their European competitors.

303871426,"Lee, Tahirih Victoria",Law and local autonomy at the International Mixed Court of Shanghai,Contemporary,"Local Chinese and foreigners jointly operated The International Mixed Court of Shanghai from 1864 to 1927 in the International Settlement of Shanghai. It was most famous for its political trials of Chinese revolutionaries. Its trial in 1925 of Chinese students helped spark the May 30th Movement. Yet archival records left by the Chinese and foreigners who ran the Court and litigated there show that the Court performed other functions with far reaching effects. The Zongli Yamen founded the Court with British diplomats to give consuls in Shanghai the means to keep order among their subjects. It granted the Court a small jurisdiction and placed it inside the national Qing court system with the right of appeal up to the emperor. The Court developed procedures, however, that circumvented its jurisdictional limitations and strengthened its local autonomy, even as it maintained the cooperation of local Chinese officials. The Court became a means for directing the development of Shanghai according to a European model of urban growth. Its judgments, enforced by the British Municipal Police, shifted and secured ownership of wealth and land. The Chinese whom the Court sentenced to prison worked on the chain gangs that build the streets of Shanghai still in use today. Recorded trial proceedings and Court administrative correspondence show that a Chinese magistrate and a foreign vice-consul together applied local laws according to a mixture of Anglo-American, continental European, and traditional Chinese procedure. The Municipal Police monopolized prosecutorial discretion at the Court and shut out Chiang Kaishek and his nationalist government from exercising jurisdiction over the hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens, vast financial reserves, and the revolutionaries who sought refuge in the Settlement. The library collections of Shanghai's pre-1949 law schools reveal that the Court gave birth to a profession of Chinese lawyers whose energy and creativity and receptivity to new legal forms created a new court system for Shanghai and contributed to a burgeoning new legal culture. Though the Court was an irritant to relations between national Chinese officials and foreigners, thousands of Chinese landlords, merchants, and bankers, even the Shanghai magistrate, used the Court to settle their disputes. Confidential correspondences show that local Chinese merchants and lawyers pressed for Chinese control of the Court, but they wished to retain its western-style procedure and its freedom to enforce local laws and customs.",1990,1990,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, Law, China, Shanghai, courts",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States

Focusing on the procurement and transport of military provisions across the Yalu River, this study examines the cross-border movement of goods, money, and people in times of war and investigates how the successive wars involving Korea's Chosoˇn dynasty—from the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s to the Manchu raids against Korea in the 1620s and 30s—shaped and were conditioned by the nature of local commerce and society in the border region between China and Korea. The existing scholarship on the Chinese-Korean relations of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has viewed the Japanese invasion of Korea as a crucial turning point. Responding to the Chosoˇn court's request for help to defend against Japanese aggression, China's Ming court dispatched expeditionary forces across the Yalu River, and their long-term presence in Chosoˇn society necessitated an increased level of coordination between the governments of China and Korea. On a social level, the arrival of Ming soldiers also facilitated the cross-border movement of supplies and people during and in the wake of the Japanese invasion. Yet, previous studies have examined the Chinese-Korean relations during this period primarily from political and military perspectives, and their analysis has not fully considered the social and commercial fluidity across the Chinese-Korean borders. Drawing on Chinese and Korean primary sources, this study investigates the social ramifications caused by the procurement and transport of military provisions in the Chinese-Korean borderland from the following five perspectives. First, it examines the experience of Ming quartermasters during the Japanese invasion of Korea and assesses the nature of challenges that they faced in the border region, including a difference in the media of exchange used in Ming China and Chosoˇn Korea at the end of the sixteenth century. Second, it analyzes the involvement of Chinese merchants in the Ming's war effort in Korea and sheds light on ways in which merchants affected the Ming armies' military campaign and Korea's wartime society. Third, it investigates the wartime experience of Ming soldiers in Korea, including food shortages and epidemics, and examines how Ming commanders sought, with little success, to prevent friction between their soldiers and local residents in Korea. Fourth, we analyze climatic and topographical factors which affected the choice of transport methods during wartime in the border region between China and Korea. The transport of provisions was often hampered by the forces of nature, including weather patterns and terrain conditions. Finally, this study analyzes writings of the Ming official Mao Yuanyi, one of the most prolific writers on military logistics during the late Ming period. We examine his writings on the transport of provisions and assess advantages and disadvantages of various transport methods in the late Ming period. By analyzing the cross-border wars from the late sixteenth to early seventeenth centuries from these five perspectives, this study ultimately shows the manner in which the procurement and transport of military provisions profoundly disrupted the lives of local residents and their agricultural cycle and left an enduring impact on the society of the borderland between China and Korea.",2013,2013,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,History,History,"History, Military history, China, Cross-border wars, Korea, Ming dynasty, Yalu River",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States

I focus on the connection between the field of nutrition ( yingyangxue ) and the social production of knowledge—namely, how biomedical nutrition contributed to, as well as helped construct, specific kinds of lived bodily experiences demonstrative of Chinese modernity. In the early twentieth century, biomedical nutrition emerged as an important branch of scientific inquiry in urban China. Although most commonly associated with food research, the field of Chinese nutrition also advanced research into the physiological processes and characteristics of the Chinese. Spurred by popular New Culture sentiments that envisioned societal advancement through the lockstep development of science and democracy, researchers sought to identify the proper metrics for evaluating the health and well-being of the Chinese populace. They endeavored to identify the physiological standards specific to the Chinese, and in so doing, struggled to reconcile the claims of biomedical universalism against the specificity deemed inherent in the Chinese body. In developing the language and scientific criteria for normative health that would guide nutritionally-oriented social engineering projects in the 1930s and 1940s, researchers redefined the relations linking scientific research and the social sphere. Biomedical nutritional researchers articulated new sites for the production of experimental knowledge as well as reshaped the international discourse of scientific nutrition to fit a Chinese context. By focusing upon children, researchers lent credence to nationalist arguments that the strength of the nation derived from its children's bodies and helped institute physical examination techniques in institutional settings ranging from community health contests to government schools. By focusing upon biomedical nutritional research and the Chinese community of researchers invested in the task of integrating nutritional knowledge into the fabric of the Chinese everyday, this dissertation helps fill a lacuna in the historiography of the spread of western science and the social construction of scientific knowledge. Biomedical nutrition in Republican China was neither a simple case of native acquiescence nor local resistance.

Still, the potential impact of the elections is clearly limited by the authoritarian environment.

304307625,"Rogaski, Ruth","From protecting life to defending the nation: The emergence of public health in Tianjin, 1859-1953",Contemporary,"This dissertation examines the shifting meaning and practice of weisheng (health, hygiene, literally protecting life) in the northern Chinese treaty-port of Tianjin from the late Qing to the early years of the People's Republic. Originally defined as techniques for illness-prevention practiced by the individual, the concept of weisheng expanded along with the expanding power of the state throughout the first decades of the twentieth century, finally being incorporated into the term gonggong weisheng (public health), a politically charged web of interrelations which encompassed the individual, the city, and the nation. The study begins with the entrance of Western medicine in Tianjin in 1859, and follows with a comparison of Chinese and Western strategies for health in the nineteenth-century city. The study then considers the fragmented nature of public services in the late Qing, a situation due in part to the particular social dynamics between elite merchants, foreigners, and Qing officials. Competing interests between these groups limited the formation of a unified urban identity for Tianjin and hampered the formation of meaningful services for the city as a whole. Ultimately the individual, not the community or the state, was responsible for the protection of his or her own health. The dissertation then examines the impact of the 1900-1902 foreign occupation of Tianjin and the establishment of a municipal sanitary police. Beginning in the New Policies period and continuing through the rule of the Nationalists, successive Chinese modernizing administrations found this model of state-centered public health appealing but difficult to enact. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, attempts at creating an arena for state action against a microbiological enemy met with considerable difficulties arising from limited funds, competing interests, and popular resistance. It was only after 1949, when faced with the threat of American germ warfare, that the Communist administration in Tianjin was able to effectively combine nationalism, germ theory, and public health to mobilize individuals in the Patriotic Hygiene Campaign of 1953. The dissertation argues that in the case of semi-colonial Chinese cities such as Tianjin, Western public health theories and policies were adopted and employed by Chinese elites as a means to both expand the reach of the state and to assert China's political autonomy in the face of growing Western encroachment.",1996,1996,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, Public health, China",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
304459360,"Wu, Yi-Li",Transmitted secrets: The doctors of the lower Yangzi region and popular gynecology in late imperial China,Modern,"What did people in late imperial China think about women's illnesses, and how was this knowledge created, legitimated, and transmitted? My dissertation addresses these issues by analyzing the lives, activities, and writings of five medical lineages from the lower Yangzi region who were famous for their skills in treating women's diseases. The dissertation focuses primarily on two lineages from the prefecture of Shaoxing: the monks of the Bamboo Grove Monastery and the Qian family. Beginning in the late eighteenth century and all during the nineteenth century, popular self-help gynecological handbooks attributed to these two lineages circulated widely throughout China. Drawing on these texts and other medical works, local histories, and literary collections, my dissertation presents case histories of these lineages and uses them as vehicles to examine Chinese attitudes towards women's medicine and health care. The first part of the dissertation examines the traditional social and medical context in which doctors such as the Bamboo Grove monks and the Qians lived and worked. It begins by analyzing the medical and social values that doctors used to legitimate themselves as healers, contrasting the ideals associated with lineage doctors (shiyi) and Confucian-scholar doctors (ruyi). The place of medical specialism within the classical medical tradition is also addressed in depth. The second part of the dissertation presents detailed case studies of the Bamboo Grove Monastery, the Qian family, and the texts that bore their names. Two main themes are highlighted: the interplay between classical and popular medical practices, and the persistent importance of self-dosing and household-based medicine as strategies for managing women's illnesses. The dissertation also examines the ailments and cures described in the Bamboo Grove and Qian works to explore how learned ideas about women's diseases were transformed for popular consumption. Finally, the concluding section of the dissertation explores how the social and political reform movements in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century China transformed the social and medical meanings assigned to lineage practice and proprietary gynecological knowledge.",1998,1998,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, Science history, Womens studies, Bamboo grove monastery, China, Doctors, Gynecology, Imperial, Qian family, Women's health, Yangzi region",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
1492975324,"Xu, Xiaohong",Reordering China: Culture and Power in the Chinese Communist Revolution,Contemporary,"This dissertation examines how cultural repertoires and power shaped the organization of the Chinese Communist revolutionaries, as well as the impact that their organizational pattern had on other movements. I explore both the changing power structure that conditioned the rise of Communist activism and the ways that revolutionaries used existing repertoires and practices to forge new ways of organizing and strategizing. The research is based on original sources that I collected from several archives and libraries (e.g., the CCP Archives at the Bureau of Investigation in Taipei, the YMCA Archives in Minneapolis), as well as published compilations of primary sources, interview data, and revolutionaries' autobiographical materials. Drawing from these sources, I trace the processes through which the revolutionary vanguard emerged from existing activist organizations and developed its dialectical strategy. The vanguard experienced a persistent tension between maintaining vanguardist identity and achieving organizational expansion. I argue that the vanguard organization, while seeking violent rupture to transform the social structure, was predicated on creating an orderly and disciplinary approach to accomplish that task. Collective self-cultivation practices furnished the requisite group ethos. The Maoist dialectical strategy provided organizational mechanism to reconcile the need for solidarity with the aim for social struggle when the boundary of its constituencies was shifting and expanding. The effect on other organizations, documented in the dissertation in the case of the YMCA, was that the multiple and boundary-crossing civic networks were replaced by social cleavage. Such an ethos was difficult to routinize, even when its boundaries expanded nationally and its representatives captured state power: as evidenced by the Red Guard Movement, detailed in the final substantive chapter, it was liable to reappropriation by other political actors whose projects lacked organizational coherence. The vanguard party's attempt to generate a disciplinary order out of social rupture, therefore, reached a limit and encountered its own antithesis.",2014,2014,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"History, Sociology, Organization Theory, China, Communism, Cultural Revolution, Revolutions, Social movements, YMCA",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States

Its main purpose is to identify some generalizable patterns of multilateral international relations before or during the use of force by states. First, after a critical review of the relevant existing theories of international conflict, a set of alternative logic is presented. Then, basic techniques of social network analysis are applied to the time-series data on international delegations within the above group. Third, the Khmer Rouge's mental and organizational attributes are examined. Finally, by combining the arguments of the above three steps, the longitudinal changes in the perceptions and calculations of Cambodia, Vietnam and China are interpreted. It is found that multilateral international relations before or during the use of force in Southeast Asia in the late 1970s have important dynamics. Anticipation of new participants in a conflict and future behavior of other participants affect the present behavior of a state. The special attributes of the Khmer Rouge were fundamental condition that started the Third Indochina Conflict, but the dynamics of a series of aggressions and the response to it are explained initially by the relations among Cambodia, Vietnam, China, and Thailand, and later by the relations among a larger group of countries, especially Cambodia, Vietnam, China, the ASEAN states, the USSR, and the US.",1991,1991,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"International law, International relations, History, History, ASEAN, Cambodia, China, Thailand, Vietnam",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
884650723,"Wang, Jinping","Between Family and State: Networks of Literati, Clergy, and Villagers in Shanxi, North China, 1200–1400",Medieval,"Over the past several decades, American historians of medieval China have reached a consensus about social change between 1200 and 1400. Drawing mainly from documents written by Confucian-educated literati in southern China, they have argued that the major shift in medieval Chinese society occurred in the strategies by which elite status was achieved by the highest status social groups, from the pursuit of high office at the national level to seeking leadership in local society. This picture of social change leaves out the very different forces at work in north China during the same time period. By employing the abundant epigraphical evidence available from Shanxi province, much of it newly uncovered, and looking at the networks that bound northern Chinese society together rather than focusing on individual social groups, like the literati, we see that existing interpretations are inadequate. These inscriptions from Shanxi depict a medieval local society very different from that described by literati writings, in which literati elites dominate. In north China, the Mongol conquest disempowered literati, and clergy and villagers acquired greater influence. New Buddhist and Daoist institutions rose to prominence, and villagers organized themselves through irrigation societies. Through new networks built around these institutions, the men and women in Shanxi remade local society and transformed the relationship between local communities and the state. Under Jurchen rule (the Jin dynasty, 1115-1234), Confucian-educated literati generally retained their status as political and social elites. Nation-wide literati networks were partly organized around the civil service examination and school education systems. They functioned to place educated men in schools and, ultimately, into political office. The Mongol conquest dramatically changed the social order by destroying the literati networks, and contributing to the rise of new social groups. The clergy of Complete Realization Daoism was one of the new emergent social groups. During the catastrophic Mongol invasion, Quanzhen Daoist networks filled an important function by providing havens for diverse groups, including former literati and women. In Shanxi, Quanzhen Daoist monks and nuns formed extensive networks through many Quanzhen projects—such as printing a new Daoist canon and building Quanzhen institutions like the Palace of Eternal Joy. The Mongol rulers from Khubilai (r. 1260-1293) onward established many pro-Buddhist policies that resulted in the rise of a new nation-wide Buddhist network. Under the Yuan dynasty (1270-1368), the Mongol state granted official positions and rank to religious clergy just as they did for civil officials. Buddhists and Daoists exercised state power through personal connections to Mongol rulers and autonomous systems of religious administration. The clergy's networks also connected to lay families through kinship networks surrounding powerful monks and nuns, who used their official status to provide economic advantage and social prestige to their lay families. In addition, both Daoist and Buddhists modified the concept of filial piety, an originally Confucian ideal concerning relations between parents and children, to create fictive family ties that helped the clergy reinforce cross-regional religious lineages spanning generations or to reconcile the clergy's obligations to their families with their religious vows. Additionally, Buddhist and Daoist churches played crucial roles in rebuilding local society in north China. Many powerless villagers sought protection from Buddhist and Daoist monasteries, which had massive landholdings, including farm land. Buddhists and Daoists participated in agricultural production in association with local residents. In the recovery of local agricultural economy in Shanxi, both Buddhists and Daoists helped repair and develop irrigation projects, and they acted as heads of local irrigation associations. By doing so, the clergy extended their influence in social institutions beyond monasteries, such as village organizations.",2011,2011,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"Religious history, History, Medieval history, Buddhism, China, Clergy, Literati, Mongol rule, Quanzhen Daoism, Social networks, Yuan Dynasty",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
2090000013,"Wolin, Daniela","Everyday Stress, Exceptional Suffering: Bioarchaeology of Violence and Personhood in Late Shang, China",Ancient,"The Late Shang period (ca. 1250-1050 BCE) of China is a unique context where archaeological features and artifacts, human skeletal remains, and a coeval writing system (inscribed oracle bones) document the practice of ritual sacrifice, which claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people. Although thousands of human skeletons from sacrificial and non-sacrificial contexts have been systematically excavated over the past 90 years at the urban settlement of Yinxu in Anyang city, Henan province, osteological analyses of direct and indirect violence have only been published for a small fraction of these remains. My dissertation uses a bioarchaeological framework to study the intersection of violence, gender, and ritual practices during the Late Shang period of northern China. Through the study of human osteology, contextualized with mortuary analysis and oracle bone inscriptions (OBI), I explore how violence in Late Shang society was a culturally constructed and ritually meaningful practice, that was mediated through social identity. To explore how violence influenced the lived experiences of people during this time, I collected osteological data from various locales at Yinxu, including both royal and neighborhood areas. A spectrum of different types of violence were occurring simultaneously, ranging from exceptional performances of violence – warfare, captivity, and human sacrifice – to small-scale """"everyday"""" and structural violence among the general population. For the residential neighborhood of Yinxu Liujiazhuang, an overall low prevalence of trauma indicative of interpersonal violence was identified at this site, suggesting that integrative mechanisms, such as religion, feasting, communal ritual activities, and sacrifice, may have promoted social cohesion among the general population. A slightly higher percentage of healed trauma on the skulls of females, however, is suggestive of gender-based violence. Oral pathologies and osteological indicators of health and nutritional stress, while limited, also point toward differences in diet and susceptibility to disease. These results were compared to two regional settlements in Shangdong province: Jinan Liujiazhuang and Tengzhou Qianzhangda. Low levels of trauma were also observed in these collections, however, variation in the prevalence of oral pathologies between Yinxu and Jinan Liujiazhuang indicate differences in diet between these regions. My analysis of sacrificial victims from royal and residential areas at Yinxu demonstrated that many of the skulls of decapitated victims displayed healed trauma in addition to direct evidence of perimortem beheading. These lesions document a process of physical abuse that likely began at the time of initial confrontation and continued throughout captivity until the individuals were chosen to be ritually decapitated. Through these interactions, personhood was (re)constituted as the Shang captors imposed new social identities on them both in life and in death. Osteological evidence of nutritional deficiencies and mechanical stress suggest that captives may have been forced to carry out taxing labor until the time they were selected for ritual sacrifice. By focusing on trauma and paleopathology, my research highlights the range of lived experiences among the men and women of Yinxu. This study challenges past reconstructions that see males as the sole perpetrators and recipients of violence and encourages scholars to integrate gender theory into future research. Finally, as one of few anthropologically-oriented studies on violence in the Late Shang that utilizes bioarchaeological methods and theory, this dissertation demonstrates the importance of incorporating all lines of evidence – including human skeletal remains – into reconstructions of ancient societies in order to construct a rich and diverse narrative.",2018,2018,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,NA,NA,"Social sciences, Bioarchaeology, China, Human Sacrifice, Personhood, Shang Dynasty, Violence,",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States
2090000010,"Fertik, Edward S.","Steel and Sovereignty: The United States, Nationalism, and the Transformation of World Order, 1898-1941",Contemporary,"In 1943 Brazilian President Getulio Vargas declared that his country's new national steelworks represented the transformation of Brazil from """"a semicolonial agrarian country"""" to one """"able to meet the exigencies of an autonomous industrial life."""" Built by American engineers, using American equipment, with a low-interest loan from the U.S. government, over objections from U.S. bondholders and exporters, and despite stiff competition from German manufacturers and the German government, this steelworks stands at the endpoint of a transformation of the institutional order of global capitalism, from an order in which economic interdependence was a threat to the sovereignty of developing countries, to one designed to guarantee it. This dissertation argues that this transformation was the result of concerted efforts by nationalists in developing countries to overcome an old system of creditor-debtor relations – imperialism – and replace it with a new one – international development – and that it was made possible by the rise of anti-imperialist nationalism after World War I and Germany's turn away from cooperation with the Britain and the U.S. after the collapse of international liberalism in 1931. Using documents collected from research in thirty official, firm, bank, and personal archives in Great Britain, Germany, the U.S., and Brazil, it shows how the business strategies of consulting engineers, capital goods producers, and international banks, and the efforts of policymakers and diplomats to manage interdependence, combined to forge a new international economic order in the interwar years. Rather than leading this worldwide trend, the United States was a follower, entering and only when, in the late 1930s, American fear of German economic and political gains from cooperation with nationalists in Brazil led US policymakers to abandon the defense of bondholders and the separation of economics and politics in international life, embracing instead a new """"dollar diplomacy"""" whose effects would soon be felt around the world. """"Steel and Sovereignty"""" proceeds in six chapters. The first lays out a framework for understanding the explosiveness of imperialist diplomacy before 1914, and looks at how U.S. administrations tried to stabilize it before, during, and after World War I. Chapter 2 reinterprets the history of American financial power between 1924 and 1930. Tracing the interactions between the international activities of upstart American banks like Dillon Read and W. A. Harriman and U.S. government policy, it demonstrates that a combination of official U.S. neutralism and the specific organization of the U.S. capital market prevented nationalists in developing countries from consummating steel projects by borrowing from abroad. The third chapter focuses on the attempts of the German and British governments, machinery firms, and steel engineers in the 1930s to supply Romania, Yugoslavia, Iran, Turkey and China with modern steel industries. German success in Turkey triggered a drastic response in Great Britain, which willingly sacrificed the interests of British bondholders to keep Turkey from drifting into the German orbit. German success in China meanwhile provoked the first realization among American policymakers that a new approach was necessary if they were not to lose markets and favor in a strategically and commercially important developing country. Chapter 4 turns the view back to the rich world by investigating 1930s projects to achieve self-sufficiency in steel production in Great Britain, Germany, and Japanese Manchuria. Highlighting mobile technologies pioneered by the Anglo-American engineer Hermann Brassert and a slew of actors in the German steel industry, it demonstrates that the search for """"raw material freedom"""" was a staggeringly complex process in which expertise and technology moved from one highly politicized economic setting to another. Chapters 5 and 6 look to Brazil, where intensifying German competition helped Brazil's authoritarian regime escape the regime of sovereign lending, and German offers to build a steel industry in the late 1930s were the wedge that opened the doors to massive U.S. official aid to Brazil. This final chapter shows the contortions that Roosevelt administration officials put themselves through to justify such a program, but how as a result an entirely new precedent for development aid was established. An epilogue follows changes in U.S. attitudes towards sovereignty and intergovernmental lending into the postwar period.

4230000070,"Cho, Yong Min",The Mongol Impact: Rebuilding the Arts System in Yuan China (1271-1368),Medieval,"The Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) was a period of major cultural transformation in the imperial court of China, when the Mongols, the tent-dwelling pastoral nomadic peoples of the North Asian steppe, became rulers of a world empire. In addition to bringing significant changes in the social, political, commercial, and religious orders in China, the Mongols also completely transformed the realm of visual and material culture. A new hierarchy of artistic forms emerged, in which woven images in silk reigned supreme. The Mongol rulers also proposed new theorizations of picture making to explain why woven images were more realistic than paintings or embroideries. Organized around a work of Vajrabhairava mandala silk tapestry (ca. 1329), each chapter of this dissertation addresses a specific aspect of the Mongol impact, from the issues of art taxonomy and hierarchy (chapter 2) to the tradition of ancestral image worship (chapter 3), the function of mandalas as tantric portraits (chapter 4), and the understanding of silk tapestry as a technology of embodiment (chapter 5). The driving force behind the changes that happened in the Chinese court under Mongol rule was twofold. First, the unprecedented diversity of artists working for the court—for instance, Nepalese iconographers from the Himalayas, Uighur and Tangut weavers from Central Asia, gold-thread makers from West Asia, and painters from South China—fostered immense artistic creativity. Second, the Mongol imperial family had a deep preference for pictures and icons made of animal fibers due to their native material culture of pastoral nomadic lifeways, which gave them continuous access to a surplus of animal furs. By demonstrating the major impact of Mongol rule in the arts, this study provides new perspectives on the study of premodern East and Central Asian visual culture, an approach that considers the contribution of the North Asian pastoral nomads in creating the multicultural world of art in premodern China and beyond. This approach thus challenges the common assumption that Mongols—and more broadly, pastoral nomads of North Asia—lacked a sophisticated native art tradition. To describe the visual and material culture of the medieval Mongols, the categories of art commonly used in the field today—such as “textiles” or “paintings”—may not be precise enough; a new set of art taxonomies is necessary to accurately describe their visual and material culture. It also elucidates important networks of artistic exchange across East and Central Asia, some of which had previously been little explored. For instance, the visual and material culture that flourished in the Tangut state of Western Xia (1038-1227) in Central Asia was of paramount importance for the development of the technologies of creating embodied images in the Mongol court.",2020,2020,Ph.D.,United States,Yale University,History of Art,History,"Yuan dynasty, North Asia, Mongol, East Asia, Central Asia, Western Xia,",45,New Haven,Connecticut,41.3113,-72.9246,United States

The introduction addresses the core issues of writing a critical history of Chinese computing. The first chapter starts with the rise of cybernetics systems engineering in the PRC in the work of Qian Xuesen, which, due to Qian's unusual career path, connected some of the common themes in other chapters. The second chapter presents a long history of early Chinese programming languages and software and analyzes a hidden software development and maintenance crisis that fundamentally shaped the development after the 1980s. Chapter three is a history of early Chinese AI and a historiographical intervention that connects the Mao (chapters one and two) and the Deng era (chapters four and five) by, ironically, identifying a rupture in research paradigms. Chapter four explores the emergence of a socio-technical imaginary of the computational future through the computer education campaign for children between the late 1970s and early 1990s. The last chapter examines the distinctive path Chinese quantitative economics took from the 1950s to the 1990s that represented both the common themes and the overall trajectory of quantification in the PRC.
