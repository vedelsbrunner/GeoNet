# GeoNet

This project explores Visualization Techniques for Node Overlap Resolution in Geographic Networks.

The Application is called GeoNet and is split into two separated phases: The Layout Creation and Layout Rendering. The Layout Creation is responsible for creating the layouts and the Layout Rendering is responsible for visualizing the layouts created in the Layout Rendering phase.
